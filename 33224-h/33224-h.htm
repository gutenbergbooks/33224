<h3>PREFACE TO THE NINTH EDITION.</h3>

<p>The Principles of Geology in the first five editions embraced
not only a view of the <i>modern changes</i> of the earth and its
inhabitants, as set forth in the present work, but also some
account of those monuments of analogous changes of <i>ancient</i>
date, both in the organic and inorganic world, which it is the
business of the geologist to interpret. The subject last mentioned,
or "geology proper," constituted originally a fourth
book, now omitted, the same having been enlarged into a separate
treatise, first published in 1838, in one volume 12mo., and
called "The Elements of Geology," afterwards recast in two
volumes 12mo. in 1842, and again re-edited under the title of
"Manual of Elementary Geology," in one volume 8vo.in 1851.
The "Principles" and "Manual" thus divided, occupy, with one
exception, to which I shall presently allude, very different
ground. The "Principles" treat of such portions of the economy
of existing nature, animate and inanimate, as are illustrative
of Geology, so as to comprise an investigation of the
permanent effects of causes now in action, which may serve as
records to after ages of the present condition of the globe and
its inhabitants. Such effects are the enduring monuments of
the ever-varying state of the physical geography of the globe,
the lasting signs of its destruction and renovation, and the
memorials of the equally fluctuating condition of the organic
world. They may be regarded, in short, as a symbolical language,
in which the earth's autobiography is written.</p>

<p>In the "Manual of Elementary Geology," on the other hand,
I have treated briefly of the component materials of the earth's
crust, their arrangement and relative position, and their organic
contents, which, when deciphered by aid of the key supplied
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">vi</a></span>
by the study of the modern changes above alluded to, reveal to
us the annals of a grand succession of past events&mdash;a series of
revolutions which the solid exterior of the globe, and its living
inhabitants, have experienced in times antecedent to the creation
of man.</p>

<p>In thus separating the two works, however, I have retained
in the "Principles" (book i.) the discussion of some matters
which might fairly be regarded as common to both treatises;
as for example, an historical sketch of the early progress of
geology, followed by a series of preliminary essays to explain
the facts and arguments which lead me to believe that the
forces now operating upon and beneath the earth's surface may
be the same, both in kind and degree, as those which at remote
epochs have worked out geological changes. (See Analysis of
Contents of this work, p. <a href="#Page_ix">ix</a>.)</p>

<p>If I am asked whether the "Principles" or the "Manual"
should be studied first, I feel much the same difficulty in
answering the question as if a student should inquire whether
he ought to take up first a treatise on Chemistry, or one on
Natural Philosophy, subjects sufficiently distinct, yet inseparably
connected. On the whole, while I have endeavored to make
each of the two treatises, in their present form, quite independent
of the other, I would recommend the reader to study first
the modern changes of the earth and its inhabitants as they are
discussed in the present volume, proceeding afterwards to the
classification and interpretation of the monuments of more
remote ages.</p>

<h2>PRINCIPLES OF GEOLOGY.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>BOOK I.</h3>

<h4>CHAPTER I.</h4>

<h5>Geology defined&mdash;Compared to History&mdash;Its relation to other Physical Sciences&mdash;Not
to be confounded with Cosmogony.</h5>

<p>Geology is the science which investigates the successive changes that
have taken place in the organic and inorganic kingdoms of nature; it
inquires into the causes of these changes, and the influence which they
have exerted in modifying the surface and external structure of our planet.</p>

<p>By these researches into the state of the earth and its inhabitants at
former periods, we acquire a more perfect knowledge of its present condition,
and more comprehensive views concerning the laws now governing
its animate and inanimate productions. When we study history, we
obtain a more profound insight into human nature, by instituting a comparison
between the present and former states of society. We trace the
long series of events which have gradually led to the actual posture of
affairs; and by connecting effects with their causes, we are enabled to
classify and retain in the memory a multitude of complicated relations&mdash;the
various peculiarities of national character&mdash;the different degrees of
moral and intellectual refinement, and numerous other circumstances,
which, without historical associations, would be uninteresting or imperfectly
understood. As the present condition of nations is the result of
many antecedent changes, some extremely remote, and others recent,
some gradual, others sudden and violent; so the state, of the natural
world is the result of a long succession of events; and if we would enlarge
our experience of the present economy of nature, we must investigate
the effects of her operations in former epochs.</p>

<p>We often discover with surprise, on looking back into the chronicles
of nations, how the fortune of some battle has influenced the fate of
millions of our contemporaries, when it has long been forgotten by the
mass of the population. With this remote event we may find inseparably
connected the geographical boundaries of a great state, the language
now spoken by the inhabitants, their peculiar manners, laws, and
religious opinions. But far more astonishing and unexpected are the
connections brought to light, when we carry back our researches into
the history of nature. The form of a coast, the configuration of the in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>terior
of a country, the existence and extent of lakes, valleys, and mountains,
can often be traced to the former prevalence of earthquakes and
volcanoes in regions which have long been undisturbed. To these remote
convulsions the present fertility of some districts, the sterile character of
others, the elevation of land above the sea, the climate, and various peculiarities,
may be distinctly referred. On the other hand, many distinguishing
features of the surface may often be ascribed to the operation,
at a remote era, of slow and tranquil causes&mdash;to the gradual deposition
of sediment in a lake or in the ocean, or to the prolific increase of testacea
and corals.</p>

<p>To select another example, we find in certain localities subterranean
deposits of coal, consisting of vegetable matter, formerly drifted into
seas and lakes. These seas and lakes have since been filled up, the lands
whereon the forests grew have disappeared or changed their form, the
rivers and currents which floated the vegetable masses can no longer be
traced, and the plants belonged to species which for ages have passed
away from the surface of our planet. Yet the commercial prosperity,
and numerical strength of a nation, may now be mainly dependent on
the local distribution of fuel determined by that ancient state of things.</p>

<p>Geology is intimately related to almost all the physical sciences, as
history is to the moral. An historian should, if possible, be at once profoundly
acquainted with ethics, politics, jurisprudence, the military art,
theology; in a word, with all branches of knowledge by which any insight
into human affairs, or into the moral and intellectual nature of man,
can be obtained. It would be no less desirable that a geologist should
be well versed in chemistry, natural philosophy, mineralogy, zoology,
comparative anatomy, botany; in short, in every science relating to organic
and inorganic nature. With these accomplishments, the historian
and geologist would rarely fail to draw correct and philosophical conclusions
from the various monuments transmitted to them of former occurrences.
They would know to what combination of causes analogous
effects were referable, and they would often be enabled to supply, by
inference, information concerning many events unrecorded in the defective
archives of former ages. But as such extensive acquisitions are
scarcely within the reach of any individual, it is necessary that men who
have devoted their lives to different departments should unite their
efforts; and as the historian receives assistance from the antiquary, and
from those who have cultivated different branches of moral and political
science, so the geologist should avail himself of the aid of many naturalists,
and particularly of those who have studied the fossil remains of lost
species of animals and plants.</p>

<p>The analogy, however, of the monuments consulted in geology, and
those available in history, extends no farther than to one class of historical
monuments&mdash;those which may be said to be <i>undesignedly</i> commemorative
of former events. The canoes, for example, and stone hatchets
found in our peat bogs, afford an insight into the rude arts and manners
of the earliest inhabitants of our island; the buried coin fixes the date<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
of the reign of some Roman emperor; the ancient encampment indicates
the districts once occupied by invading armies, and the former method
of constructing military defences; the Egyptian mummies throw light
on the art of embalming, the rites of sepulture, or the average stature
of the human race in ancient Egypt. This class of memorials yields to
no other in authenticity, but it constitutes a small part only of the resources
on which the historian relies, whereas in geology it forms the
only kind of evidence which is at our command. For this reason we
must not expect to obtain a full and connected account of any series of
events beyond the reach of history. But the testimony of geological
monuments, if frequently imperfect, possesses at least the advantage of
being free from all intentional misrepresentation. We may be deceived
in the inferences which we draw, in the same manner as we often mistake
the nature and import of phenomena observed in the daily course of nature;
but our liability to err is confined to the interpretation, and, if this
be correct, our information is certain.</p>

<p>It was long before the distinct nature and legitimate objects of geology
were fully recognized, and it was at first confounded with many other
branches of inquiry, just as the limits of history, poetry, and mythology
were ill-defined in the infancy of civilization. Even in Werner's time,
or at the close of the eighteenth century, geology appears to have been
regarded as little other than a subordinate department of mineralogy;
and Desmarest included it under the head of Physical Geography. But
the most common and serious source of confusion arose from the notion,
that it was the business of geology to discover the mode in which the
earth originated, or, as some imagined, to study the effects of those cosmological
causes which were employed by the Author of Nature to
bring this planet out of a nascent and chaotic state into a more perfect
and habitable condition. Hutton was the first who endeavored to draw
a strong line of demarcation between his favorite science and cosmogony,
for he declared that geology was in nowise concerned "with questions
as to the origin of things."</p>

<p>An attempt will be made in the sequel of this work to demonstrate
that geology differs as widely from cosmogony, as speculations concerning
the mode of the first creation of man differ from history. But, before
entering more at large on this controverted question, it will be desirable
to trace the progress of opinion on this topic, from the earliest
ages to the commencement of the present century.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER II.</h4>

<h6>HISTORICAL SKETCH OF THE PROGRESS OF GEOLOGY.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Oriental Cosmogony&mdash;Hymns of the Vedas&mdash;Institutes of Men&ugrave;&mdash;Doctrine of the
successive destruction and renovation of the world&mdash;Origin of this doctrine&mdash;Common
to the Egyptians&mdash;Adopted by the Greeks&mdash;System of Pythagoras&mdash;Of
Aristotle&mdash;Dogmas concerning the extinction and reproduction of genera
and species&mdash;Strabo's theory of elevation by earthquakes&mdash;Pliny&mdash;Concluding
Remarks on the knowledge of the Ancients.</p></div>

<p><i>Oriental Cosmogony.</i>&mdash;The earliest doctrines of the Indian and Egyptian
schools of philosophy agreed in ascribing the first creation of the
world to an omnipotent and infinite Being. They concurred also in representing
this Being, who had existed from all eternity, as having repeatedly
destroyed and reproduced the world and all its inhabitants.
In the sacred volume of the Hindoos, called the Ordinances of Men&ugrave;,
comprising the Indian system of duties religious and civil, we find a preliminary
chapter treating of the Creation, in which the cosmogony is
known to have been derived from earlier writings and traditions; and
principally from certain hymns of high antiquity, called the Vedas.
These hymns were first put together, according to Mr. Colebrooke,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> in
a connected series, about thirteen centuries before the Christian era, but
they appear from internal evidence to have been written at various antecedent
periods. In them, as we learn from the researches of Professor
Wilson, the eminent Sanscrit scholar, two distinct philosophical systems
are discoverable. According to one of them, all things were originally
brought into existence by the sole will of a single First Cause,
which existed from eternity; according to the other, there have always
existed two principles, the one material, but without form, the other
spiritual and capable of compelling "inert matter to develop its sensible
properties." This development of matter into "individual and visible
existences" is called creation, and is assigned to a subordinate agent, or the
creative faculty of the Supreme Being embodied in the person of Brahma.</p>

<p>In the first chapter of the Ordinances of Men&ugrave; above alluded to, we
meet with the following passages relating to former destructions and
renovations of the world:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Being, whose powers are incomprehensible, having created me
(Men&ugrave;) and this universe, again became absorbed in the supreme spirit,
changing the time of energy for the hour of repose.</p>

<p>"When that Power awakes, then has this world its full expansion;
but when he slumbers with a tranquil spirit, then the whole system
fades away..... For while he reposes, as it were, embodied spirits
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>endowed with principles of action depart from their several acts, and
the mind itself becomes inert."</p>

<p>The absorption of all beings into the Supreme essence is then described,
and the Divine soul itself is said to slumber, and to remain for
a time immersed in "the first idea, or in darkness." After which the
text thus proceeds (verse fifty-seven), "Thus that immutable power
by waking and reposing alternately, revivifies and destroys, in eternal succession,
this whole assemblage of locomotive and immovable creatures."</p>

<p>It is then declared that there has been a long succession of <i>manwantaras</i>,
or periods, each of the duration of many thousand ages, and&mdash;</p>

<p>"There are creations also, and destructions of worlds innumerable:
the Being, supremely exalted, performs all this with as much ease as if
in sport, again and again, for the sake of conferring happiness."<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<p>No part of the Eastern cosmogony, from which these extracts are
made, is more interesting to the geologist than the doctrine, so frequently
alluded to, of the reiterated submersion of the land beneath the
waters of a universal ocean. In the beginning of things, we are told,
the First Sole Cause "with a thought created the waters," and then
moved upon their surface in the form of Brahma the creator, by whose
agency the emergence of the dry land was effected, and the peopling
of the earth with plants, animals, celestial creatures, and man. Afterwards,
as often as a general conflagration at the close of each manwantara
had annihilated every visible and existing thing, Brahma, on
awaking from his sleep, finds the whole world a shapeless ocean. Accordingly,
in the legendary poems called the Puranas, composed at a
later date than the Vedas, the three first Avatars or descents of the
Deity upon earth have for their object to recover the land from the
waters. For this purpose Vishnu is made successively to assume the
form of a fish, a tortoise, and a boar.</p>

<p>Extravagant as may be some of the conceits and fictions which disfigure
these pretended revelations, we can by no means look upon them
as a pure effort of the unassisted imagination, or believe them to have
been composed without regard to opinions and theories founded on the
observation of Nature. In astronomy, for instance, it is declared that,
at the North Pole, the year was divided into a long day and night, and
that their long day was the northern, and their night the southern
course of the sun; and to the inhabitants of the moon, it is said one
day is equal in length to one month of mortals.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> If such statements
cannot be resolved into mere conjectures, we have no right to refer to
mere chance the prevailing notion that the earth and its inhabitants had
formerly undergone a succession of revolutions and aqueous catastrophes
interrupted by long intervals of tranquillity.</p>

<p>Now there are two sources in which such a theory may have originated.
The marks of former convulsions on every part of the surface of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>our planet are obvious and striking. The remains of marine animals
imbedded in the solid strata are so abundant, that they may be expected
to force themselves on the attention of every people who have made
some progress in refinement; and especially where one class of men
are expressly set apart from the rest, like the ancient priesthoods of
India and Egypt, for study and contemplation. If these appearances
are once recognized, it seems natural that the mind should conclude in
favor, not only of mighty changes in past ages, but of alternate periods
of repose and disorder;&mdash;of repose, when the animals now fossil lived,
grew, and multiplied&mdash;of disorder, when the strata in which they were
buried became transferred from the sea to the interior of continents, and
were uplifted so as to form part of high mountain-chains. Those modern
writers, who are disposed to disparage the former intellectual
advancement and civilization of Eastern nations, may concede some
foundation of observed facts for the curious theories now under consideration,
without indulging in exaggerated opinions of the progress of
science; especially as universal catastrophes of the world, and exterminations
of organic beings, in the sense in which they were understood
by the Brahmins, are untenable doctrines.</p>

<p>We know that the Egyptian priests were aware, not only that
the soil beneath the plains of the Nile, but that also the hills bounding
the great valley, contained marine shells; and Herodotus inferred
from these facts, that all lower Egypt, and even the high lands above
Memphis, had once been covered by the sea.<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> As similar fossil
remains occur in all parts of Asia hitherto explored, far in the
interior of the continent as well as near the sea, they could hardly
have escaped detection by some Eastern sages not less capable
than the Greek historian of reasoning philosophically on natural phenomena.</p>

<p>We also know that the rulers of Asia were engaged in very remote
eras in executing great national works, such as tanks and canals, requiring
extensive excavations. In the fourteenth century of our era
(in the year 1360), the removal of soil necessary for such undertakings
brought to light geological facts, which attracted the attention of a people
less civilized than were many of the older nations of the East. The
historian Ferishta relates that fifty thousand laborers were employed
in cutting through a mound, so as to form a junction between the rivers
Selima and Sutlej; and in this mound were found the bones of elephants
and men, some of them petrified, and some of them resembling
bone. The gigantic dimensions attributed to the human bones show
them to have belonged to some of the larger pachydermata.<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></p>

<p>But, although the Brahmins, like the priests of Egypt, may have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
been acquainted with the existence of fossil remains in the strata, it is
possible that the doctrine of successive destructions and renovations of
the world, merely received corroboration from such proofs; and that it
may have been originally handed down, like the religious traditions of
most nations, from a ruder state of society. The system may have had
its source, in part at least, in exaggerated accounts of those dreadful
catastrophes which are occasioned by particular combinations of natural
causes. Floods and volcanic eruptions, the agency of water and fire,
are the chief instruments of devastation on our globe. We shall point
out in the sequel the extent of many of these calamities, recurring at
distant intervals of time, in the present course of nature; and shall only
observe here, that they are so peculiarly calculated to inspire a lasting
terror, and are so often fatal in their consequences to great multitudes
of people, that it scarcely requires the passion for the marvellous, so
characteristic of rude and half-civilized nations, still less the exuberant
imagination of Eastern writers, to augment them into general cataclysms
and conflagrations.</p>

<p>The great flood of the Chinese, which their traditions carry back to
the period of Yaou, something more than 2000 years before our era, has
been identified by some persons with the universal deluge described in
the Old Testament; but according to Mr. Davis, who accompanied two
of our embassies to China, and who has carefully examined their written
accounts, the Chinese cataclysm is therein described as interrupting
the business of agriculture, rather than as involving a general destruction
of the human race. The great Yu was celebrated for having
"opened nine channels to draw off the waters," which "covered the
low hills and bathed the foot of the highest mountains." Mr. Davis
suggests that a great derangement of waters of the Yellow River, one of
the largest in the world, might even now cause the flood of Yaou to be
repeated, and lay the most fertile and populous plains of China under
water. In modern times the bursting of the banks of an artificial canal,
into which a portion of the Yellow River has been turned, has repeatedly
given rise to the most dreadful accidents, and is a source of perpetual
anxiety to the government. It is easy, therefore, to imagine
how much greater may have been the inundation, if this valley was
ever convulsed by a violent earthquake.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>Humboldt relates the interesting fact that, after the annihilation of a
large part of the inhabitants of Cumana, by an earthquake in 1766, a
season of extraordinary fertility ensued, in consequence of the great
rains which accompanied the subterranean convulsions. "The Indians,"
he says, "celebrated, after the ideas of an antique superstition, by festivals
and dancing, the destruction of the world and the approaching
epoch of its regeneration."<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>The existence of such rites among the rude nations of South America
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
is most important, as showing what effects may be produced by local
catastrophes, recurring at distant intervals of time, on the minds of
a barbarous and uncultivated race. I shall point out in the sequel how
the tradition of a deluge among the Araucanian Indians may be explained,
by reference to great earthquake-waves which have repeatedly
rolled over part of Chili since the first recorded flood of 1590. (See
chap. <a href="#Page_493">29</a>, Book II.) The legend also of the ancient Peruvians of an
inundation many years before the reign of the Incas, in which only six
persons were saved on a float, relates to a region which has more than
once been overwhelmed by inroads of the ocean since the days of Pizarro.
(Chap. <a href="#Page_493">29</a>, Book II.) I might refer the reader to my account of
the submergence of a wide area in Cutch so lately as the year 1819,
when a single tower only of the fort of Sindree appeared above the
waste of waters (see Chap. <a href="#Page_471">28</a>, Book II.), if it were necessary, to prove
how easily the catastrophes of modern times might give rise to traditionary
narratives, among a rude people, of floods of boundless extent. Nations
without written records, and who are indebted for all their knowledge of
past events exclusively to oral tradition, are in the habit of confounding
in one legend a series of incidents which have happened at various
epochs; nor must we forget that the superstitions of a savage tribe are
transmitted through all the progressive stages of society, till they exert
a powerful influence on the mind of the philosopher. He may find, in
the monuments of former changes on the earth's surface, an apparent
confirmation of tenets handed down through successive generations,
from the rude hunter, whose terrified imagination drew a false picture
of those awful visitations of floods and earthquakes, whereby the whole
earth as known to him was simultaneously devastated.</p>

<p><i>Egyptian Cosmogony.</i>&mdash;Respecting the cosmogony of the Egyptian
priests, we gather much information from writers of the Grecian sects,
who borrowed almost all their tenets from Egypt, and amongst others
that of the former successive destruction and renovation of the
world.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> We learn from Plutarch, that this was the theme of one of
the hymns of Orpheus, so celebrated in the fabulous ages of Greece.
It was brought by him from the banks of the Nile; and we even find
in his verses, as in the Indian systems, a definite period assigned for
the duration of each successive world.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> The returns of great catastrophes
were determined by the period of the Annus Magnus, or
great year,&mdash;a cycle composed of the revolutions of the sun, moon,
and planets, and terminating when these return together to the same
sign whence they were supposed at some remote epoch to have set out.
The duration of this great cycle was variously estimated. According to
Orpheus, it was 120,000 years; according to others, 300,000; and by
Cassander it was taken to be 360,000 years.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>We learn particularly from the Tim&aelig;us of Plato, that the Egyptians
believed the world to be subject to occasional conflagrations and
deluges, whereby the gods arrested the career of human wickedness,
and purified the earth from guilt. After each regeneration, mankind
were in a state of virtue and happiness, from which they gradually
degenerated again into vice and immorality. From this Egyptian
doctrine, the poets derived the fable of the decline from the golden to
the iron age. The sect of Stoics adopted most fully the system of catastrophes
destined at certain intervals to destroy the world. Those
they taught were of two kinds;&mdash;the Cataclysm, or destruction by
water, which sweeps away the whole human race, and annihilates all
the animal and vegetable productions of nature; and the Ecpyrosis, or
destruction by fire, which dissolves the globe itself. From the Egyptians
also they derived the doctrine of the gradual debasement of man
from a state of innocence. Towards the termination of each era, the
gods could no longer bear with the wickedness of men, and a shock of
the elements or a deluge overwhelmed them; after which calamity,
Astrea again descended on the earth to renew the golden age.<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></p>

<p>The connection between the doctrine of successive catastrophes and
repeated deteriorations in the moral character of the human race is more
intimate and natural than might at first be imagined. For, in a rude
state of society, all great calamities are regarded by the people as judgments
of God on the wickedness of man. Thus, in our own time, the
priests persuaded a large part of the population of Chili, and perhaps
believed themselves, that the fatal earthquake of 1822 was a sign of the
wrath of Heaven for the great political revolution just then consummated
in South America. In like manner, in the account given to Solon
by the Egyptian priests, of the submersion of the island of Atlantis
under the waters of the ocean, after repeated shocks of an earthquake,
we find that the event happened when Jupiter had seen the moral depravity
of the inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Now, when the notion had once gained
ground, whether from causes before suggested or not, that the earth
had been destroyed by several general catastrophes, it would next be inferred
that the human race had been as often destroyed and renovated.
And since every extermination was assumed to be penal, it could only
be reconciled with divine justice, by the supposition that man, at each
successive creation, was regenerated in a state of purity and innocence.</p>

<p>A very large portion of Asia, inhabited by the earliest nations, whose
traditions have come down to us, has been always subject to tremendous
earthquakes. Of the geographical boundaries of these, and their
effects, I shall speak in the proper place. Egypt has, for the most
part, been exempt from this scourge, and the Egyptian doctrine of great
catastrophes was probably derived in part, as before hinted, from early
geological observations, and in part from Eastern nations.</p>

<p><i>Pythagorean Doctrines.</i>&mdash;Pythagoras, who resided for more than
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
twenty years in Egypt, and, according to Cicero, had visited the East,
and conversed with the Persian philosophers, introduced into his own
country, on his return, the doctrine of the gradual deterioration of the
human race from an original state of virtue and happiness; but if we
are to judge of his theory concerning the destruction and renovation of
the earth from the sketch given by Ovid, we must concede it to have
been far more philosophical than any known version of the cosmogonies
of Oriental or Egyptian sects.</p>

<p>Although Pythagoras is introduced by the poet as delivering his doctrine
in person, some of the illustrations are derived from natural events
which happened after the death of the philosopher. But notwithstanding
these anachronisms, we may regard the account as a true picture of
the tenets of the Pythagorean school in the Augustan age; and although
perhaps partially modified, it must have contained the substance
of the original scheme. Thus considered, it is extremely curious and
instructive; for we here find a comprehensive summary of almost all
the great causes of change now in activity on the globe, and these adduced
in confirmation of a principle of a perpetual and gradual revolution
inherent in the nature of our terrestrial system. These doctrines, it
is true, are not directly applied to the explanation of geological phenomena;
or, in other words, no attempt is made to estimate what may
have been in past ages, or what may hereafter be, the aggregate amount
of change brought about by such never-ending fluctuations. Had this
been the case, we might have been called upon to admire so extraordinary
an anticipation with no less interest than astronomers, when they
endeavor to define by what means the Samian philosopher came to the
knowledge of the Copernican system.</p>

<p>Let us now examine the celebrated passages to which we have been
adverting:<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

<p>"Nothing perishes in this world; but things merely vary and change
their form. To be born, means simply that a thing begins to be something
different from what it was before; and dying, is ceasing to be
the same thing. Yet, although nothing retains long the same image,
the sum of the whole remains constant." These general propositions
are then confirmed by a series of examples, all derived from natural
appearances, except the first, which refers to the golden age giving
place to the age of iron. The illustrations are thus consecutively adduced.</p>

<p class="indent">1. Solid land has been converted into sea.</p>

<p class="indent">2. Sea has been changed into land. Marine shells lie far distant
from the deep, and the anchor has been found on the summit of hills.</p>

<p class="indent">3. Valleys have been excavated by running water, and floods have
washed down hills into the sea.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p class="indent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
4. Marshes have become dry ground.</p>

<p class="indent">5. Dry lands have been changed into stagnant pools.</p>

<p class="indent">6. During earthquakes some springs have been closed up, and new
ones have broken out. Rivers have deserted their channels, and have
been re-born elsewhere, as the Erasinus in Greece, and Mysus in Asia.</p>

<p class="indent">7. The waters of some rivers, formerly sweet, have become bitter;
as those of the Anigris, in Greece, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p class="indent">8. Islands have become connected with the mainland by the growth
of deltas and new deposits; as in the case of Antissa joined to Lesbos,
Pharos to Egypt, &amp;c.</p>

<p class="indent">9. Peninsulas have been divided from the main land, and have become
islands, as Leucadia; and according to tradition, Sicily, the sea
having carried away the isthmus.</p>

<p class="indent">10. Land has been submerged by earthquakes; the Grecian cities of
Helice and Buris, for example, are to be seen under the sea, with their
walls inclined.</p>

<p class="indent">11. Plains have been upheaved into hills by the confined air seeking
vent; as at Tr&oelig;zene in the Peloponnesus.</p>

<p class="indent">12. The temperature of some springs varies at different periods. The
waters of others are inflammable.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p class="indent">13. There are streams which have a petrifying power, and convert
the substances which they touch into marble.</p>

<p class="indent">14. Extraordinary medicinal and deleterious effects are produced by
the water of different lakes and springs.<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p class="indent">15. Some rocks and islands, after floating and having been subject
to violent movements, have at length become stationary and immovable;
as Delos and the Cyanean Isles.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p class="indent">16. Volcanic vents shift their position; there was a time when Etna
was not a burning mountain, and the time will come when it will cease
to burn. Whether it be that some caverns become closed up by the
movements of the earth, and others opened, or whether the fuel is finally
exhausted, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

<p>The various causes of change in the inanimate world having been thus
enumerated, the doctrine of equivocal generation is next propounded, as
illustrating a corresponding perpetual flux in the animate creation.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>In the Egyptian and Eastern cosmogonies, and in the Greek version
of them, no very definite meaning can, in general, be attached to the
term "destruction of the world;" for sometimes it would seem almost
to imply the annihilation of our planetary system, and at others a mere
revolution of the surface of the earth.</p>

<p><i>Opinions of Aristotle.</i>&mdash;From the works now extant of Aristotle, and
from the system of Pythagoras, as above exposed, we might certainly
infer that these philosophers considered the agents of change now operating
in nature, as capable of bringing about in the lapse of ages a complete
revolution; and the Stagyrite even considers occasional catastrophes,
happening at distant intervals of time, as part of the regular and
ordinary course of nature. The deluge of Deucalion, he says, affected
Greece only, and principally the part called Hellas, and it arose from
great inundations of rivers, during a rainy winter. But such extraordinary
winters, he says, though after a certain period they return, do not
always revisit the same places.<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p>

<p>Censorinus quotes it as Aristotle's opinion that there were general
inundations of the globe, and that they alternated with conflagrations;
and that the flood constituted the winter of the great year, or astronomical
cycle, while the conflagration, or destruction by fire, is the
summer, or period of greatest heat.<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> If this passage, as Lipsius supposes,
be an amplification, by Censorinus, of what is written in "the
Meteorics," it is a gross misrepresentation of the doctrine of the Stagyrite,
for the general bearing of his reasoning in that treatise tends clearly
in an opposite direction. He refers to many examples of changes now
constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which
they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases
of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become
watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth of the
Nilotic Delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the Palus
M&aelig;otis within sixty years from his own time; and although, in the
same chapter he says nothing of earthquakes, yet in others of the same
treatise he shows himself not unacquainted with their effects.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> He
alludes, for example, to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands
previous to a volcanic eruption. "The changes of the earth," he says,
"are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked
(&#955;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#945;&#957;&#949;&#953;): and the migrations of people after great catastrophes,
and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten."<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>When we consider the acquaintance displayed by Aristotle, in his
various works, with the destroying and renovating powers of Nature,
the introductory and concluding passages of the twelfth chapter of his
"Meteorics" are certainly very remarkable. In the first sentence he
says, "The distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not
endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where
it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea: and there is
reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain
system, and within a certain period." The concluding observation
is as follows:&mdash;"As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither
the T&agrave;nais, nor the Nile, can have flowed forever. The places where
they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations; but
there is none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up, and
they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades
others. The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not, some
always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in
the course of time."</p>

<p>It seems, then, that the Greeks had not only derived from preceding
nations, but had also, in some slight degree, deduced from their
own observations, the theory of periodical revolutions in the inorganic
world: there is, however, no ground for imagining that they contemplated
former changes in the races of animals and plants. Even the
fact that marine remains were inclosed in solid rocks, although observed
by some, and even made the groundwork of geological speculation,
never stimulated the industry or guided the inquiries of naturalists.
It is not impossible that the theory of equivocal generation might
have engendered some indifference on this subject, and that a belief in
the spontaneous production of living beings from the earth or corrupt
matter, might have caused the organic world to appear so unstable
and fluctuating, that phenomena indicative of former changes would
not awaken intense curiosity. The Egyptians, it is true, had taught,
and the Stoics had repeated, that the earth had once given birth to
some monstrous animals, which existed no longer; but the prevailing
opinion seems to have been, that after each great catastrophe the same
species of animals were created over again. This tenet is implied in a
passage of Seneca, where, speaking of a future deluge, he says, "Every
animal shall be generated anew, and man free from guilt shall be given
to the earth."<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<p>An old Arabian version of the doctrine of the successive revolutions
of the globe, translated by Abraham Ecchellensis,<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> seems to form a
singular exception to the general rule, for here we find the idea of different
genera and species having been created. The Gerbanites, a sect
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>of astronomers who flourished some centuries before the Christian era,
taught as follows:&mdash;"That after every period of thirty-six thousand
four hundred and twenty-five years, there were produced a pair of
<i>every</i> species of animal, both male and female, from whom animals
might be propagated and inhabit this lower world. But when a circulation
of the heavenly orbs was completed, which is finished in that
space of years, <i>other genera and species</i> of animals are propagated, as
also of plants and other things, and the first order is destroyed, and so
it goes on forever and ever."<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p><i>Theory of Strabo.</i>&mdash;As we learn much of the tenets of the Egyptian
and Oriental schools in the writings of the Greeks, so, many speculations
of the early Greek authors are made known to us in the works of
the Augustan and later ages. Strabo, in particular, enters largely, in
the second book of his Geography, into the opinions of Eratosthenes and
other Greeks on one of the most difficult problems in geology, viz., by
what causes marine shells came to be plentifully buried in the earth at
such great elevations and distances from the sea.</p>

<p>He notices, amongst others, the explanation of Xanthus the Lydian,
who said that the seas had once been more extensive, and that they had
afterwards been partially dried up, as in his own time many lakes, rivers,
and wells in Asia had failed during a season of drought. Treating this
conjecture with merited disregard, Strabo passes on to the hypothesis
of Strato, the natural philosopher, who had observed that the quantity
of mud brought down by rivers into the Euxine was so great, that its
bed must be gradually raised, while the rivers still continue to pour in
an undiminished quantity of water. He, therefore, conceived that, originally,
when the Euxine was an inland sea, its level had by this means
become so much elevated that it burst its barrier near Byzantium, and
formed a communication with the Propontis; and this partial drainage,
he supposed, had already converted the left side into marshy ground,
and thus, at last, the whole would be choked up with soil. So, it was
argued, the Mediterranean had once opened a passage for itself by the
Columns of Hercules into the Atlantic; and perhaps the abundance of
sea-shells in Africa, near the Temple of Jupiter Ammon, might also be
the deposit of some former inland sea, which had at length forced a
passage and escaped.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>But Strabo rejects this theory, as insufficient to account for all the
phenomena, and he proposes one of his own, the profoundness of which
modern geologists are only beginning to appreciate. "It is not," he
says, "because the lands covered by seas were originally at different
altitudes, that the waters have risen, or subsided, or receded from some
parts and inundated others. But the reason is, that the same land is
sometimes raised up and sometimes depressed, and the sea also is simultaneously
raised and depressed, so that it either overflows or returns
into its own place again. We must, therefore, ascribe the cause to the
ground, either to that ground which is under the sea, or to that which
becomes flooded by it, but rather to that which lies beneath the sea, for
this is more movable and, on account of its humidity, can be altered
with greater celerity.<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> "<i>It is proper</i>," he observes in continuation, "<i>to
derive our explanations from things which are obvious, and in some
measure of daily occurrence, such as deluges, earthquakes, and volcanic
eruptions,<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> and sudden swellings of the land beneath the sea</i>; for the
last raise up the sea also; and when the same lands subside again, they
occasion the sea to be let down. And it is not merely the small, but
the large islands also, and not merely the islands, but the continents
which can be lifted up together with the sea; and both large and small
tracts may subside, for habitations and cities, like Bure, Bizona, and
many others, have been engulphed by earthquakes."</p>

<p>In another place, this learned geographer, in alluding to the tradition
that Sicily had been separated by a convulsion from Italy, remarks, that
at present the land near the sea in those parts was rarely shaken by
earthquakes, since there were now open orifices whereby fire and ignited
matters, and waters escape; but formerly, when the volcanoes of Etna,
the Lipari Islands, Ischia, and others, were closed up, the imprisoned
fire and wind might have produced far more vehement movements.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a>
The doctrine, therefore, that volcanoes are safety-valves, and that the
subterranean convulsions are probably most violent when first the volcanic
energy shifts itself to a new quarter, is not modern.</p>

<p>We learn from a passage in Strabo,<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> that it was a dogma of the
Gaulish Druids that the universe was immortal, but destined to survive
catastrophes both of fire and water. That this doctrine was communicated
to them from the East, with much of their learning, cannot be
doubted. C&aelig;sar, it will be remembered, says that they made use of
Greek letters in arithmetical computations.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span><i>Pliny.</i>&mdash;This philosopher had no theoretical opinions of his own concerning
changes of the earth's surface; and in this department, as in
others, he restricted himself to the task of a compiler, without reasoning
on the facts stated by him, or attempting to digest them into regular
order. But his enumeration of the new islands which had been formed
in the Mediterranean, and of other convulsions, shows that the ancients
had not been inattentive observers of the changes which had taken place
within the memory of man.</p>

<p>Such, then, appear to have been the opinions entertained before the
Christian era, concerning the past revolutions of our globe. Although
no particular investigations had been made for the express purpose of
interpreting the monuments of ancient changes, they were too obvious
to be entirely disregarded; and the observation of the present course of
nature presented too many proofs of alterations continually in progress
on the earth to allow philosophers to believe that nature was in a state
of rest, or that the surface had remained, and would continue to remain
unaltered. But they had never compared attentively the results of the
destroying and reproductive operations of modern times with those of
remote eras, nor had they ever entertained so much as a conjecture concerning
the comparative antiquity of the human race, or of living species
of animals and plants, with those belonging to former conditions of the
organic world. They had studied the movements and positions of the
heavenly bodies with laborious industry, and made some progress in
investigating the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms; but the ancient
history of the globe was to them a sealed book, and, although
written in characters of the most striking and imposing kind, they were
unconscious even of its existence.</p>

<p><i>Arabian writers.</i>&mdash;After the decline of the Roman empire, the cultivation
of physical science was first revived with some success by the
Saracens, about the middle of the eighth century of our era. The
works of the most eminent classic writers were purchased at great expense
from the Christians, and translated into Arabic; and Al Mam&ucirc;n,
son of the famous Har&ucirc;n-al-Rashid, the contemporary of Charlemagne,
received with marks of distinction, at his court at Bagdad, astronomers
and men of learning from different countries. This caliph, and some of
his successors, encountered much opposition and jealousy from the doctors
of the Mahometan law, who wished the Moslems to confine their
studies to the Koran, dreading the effects of the diffusion of a taste for
the physical sciences.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<p><i>Avicenna.</i>&mdash;Almost all the works of the early Arabian writers are
lost. Amongst those of the tenth century, of which fragments are now
extant, is a short treatise, "On the Formation and Classification of
Minerals," by Avicenna, a physician, in whose arrangement there is considerable
merit. The second chapter, "On the Cause of Mountains," is
remarkable; for mountains, he says, are formed, some by essential,
others by accidental causes. In illustration of the essential, he instances
"a violent earthquake, by which land is elevated, and becomes a
mountain;" of the accidental, the principal, he says, is excavation by
water, whereby cavities are produced, and adjoining lands made to stand
out and form eminences.<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<p><i>Omar&mdash;Cosmogony of the Koran.</i>&mdash;In the same century, also, Omar,
surnamed "El Aalem," or "The Learned," wrote a work on "The Retreat
of the Sea." It appears that on comparing the charts of his own
time with those made by the Indian and Persian astronomers two thousand
years before, he had satisfied himself that important changes had
taken place since the times of history in the form of the coasts of Asia,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>and that the extension of the sea had been greater at some former periods.
He was confirmed in this opinion by the numerous salt springs
and marshes in the interior of Asia,&mdash;a phenomenon from which Pallas,
in more recent times, has drawn the same inference.</p>

<p>Von Hoff has suggested, with great probability, that the changes in
the level of the Caspian (some of which there is reason to believe have
happened within the historical era), and the geological appearances in
that district, indicating the desertion by that sea of its ancient bed, had
probably led Omar to his theory of a general subsidence. But whatever
may have been the proofs relied on, his system was declared contradictory
to certain passages in the Koran, and he was called upon
publicly to recant his errors; to avoid which persecution he went into
voluntary banishment from Samarkand.<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>The cosmological opinions expressed in the Koran are few, and
merely introduced incidentally: so that it is not easy to understand
how they could have interfered so seriously with free discussion on the
former changes of the globe. The Prophet declares that the earth was
created in two days, and the mountains were then placed on it; and
during these, and two additional days, the inhabitants of the earth were
formed; and in two more the seven heavens.<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> There is no more detail
of circumstances; and the deluge, which is also mentioned, is discussed
with equal brevity. The waters are represented to have poured
out of an oven; a strange fable, said to be borrowed from the Persian
Magi, who represented them as issuing from the oven of an old woman.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
All men were drowned, save Noah and his family; and then God said,
"O earth, swallow up thy waters; and thou, O heaven, withhold thy
rain;" and immediately the waters abated.<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p>We may suppose Omar to have represented the desertion of the land
by the sea to have been gradual, and that his hypothesis required a
greater lapse of ages than was consistent with Moslem orthodoxy; for
it is to be inferred from the Koran, that man and this planet were created
at the same time; and although Mahomet did not limit expressly
the antiquity of the human race, yet he gave an implied sanction to the
Mosaic chronology, by the veneration expressed by him for the Hebrew
Patriarchs.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>A manuscript work, entitled the "Wonders of Nature," is preserved
in the Royal Library at Paris, by an Arabian writer, Mohammed
Kazwini, who flourished in the seventh century of the Hegira, or at
the close of the thirteenth century of our era.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Besides several curious
remarks on aerolites, earthquakes, and the successive changes of position
which the land and sea have undergone, we meet with the following
beautiful passage which is given as the narrative of Kidhz, an allegorical
personage:&mdash;"I passed one day by a very ancient and wonderfully
populous city, and asked one of its inhabitants how long it had
been founded. 'It is indeed a mighty city,' replied he; 'we know
not how long it has existed, and our ancestors were on this subject
as ignorant as ourselves.' Five centuries afterwards, as I passed by
the same place, I could not perceive the slightest vestige of the city.
I demanded of a peasant, who was gathering herbs upon its former
site, how long it had been destroyed. 'In sooth a strange question!'
replied he. 'The ground here has never been different from what you
now behold it.'&mdash;'Was there not of old,' said I, 'a splendid city here?'&mdash;'Never,'
answered he, 'so far as we have seen, and never did our
fathers speak to us of any such.' On my return there 500 years afterwards,
<i>I found the sea in the same place</i>, and on its shores were a party
of fishermen, of whom I inquired how long the land had been covered
by the waters? 'Is this a question,' said they, 'for a man like
you? this spot has always been what it is now.' I again returned,
500 years afterwards, and the sea had disappeared; I inquired of a
man who stood alone upon the spot, how long ago this change had
taken place, and he gave me the same answer as I had received before.
Lastly, on coming back again after an equal lapse of time, I found
there a flourishing city, more populous and more rich in beautiful buildings,
than the city I had seen the first time, and when I would fain
have informed myself concerning its origin, the inhabitants answered
me, 'Its rise is lost in remote antiquity: we are ignorant how long it has
existed, and our fathers were on this subject as ignorant as ourselves.'"</p>

<p><i>Early Italian writers.</i>&mdash;It was not till the earlier part of the sixteenth
century that geological phenomena began to attract the attention
of the Christian nations. At that period a very animated controversy
sprang up in Italy, concerning the true nature and origin of marine
shells, and other organized fossils, found abundantly in the strata of the
peninsula. The celebrated painter Leonardo da Vinci, who in his youth
had planned and executed some navigable canals in the north of Italy,
was one of the first who applied sound reasoning to these subjects.
The mud of rivers, he said, had covered and penetrated into the interior
of fossil shells at a time when these were still at the bottom of the sea
near the coast. "They tell us that these shells were formed in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>hills by the influence of the stars; but I ask where in the hills are the
stars now forming shells of distinct ages and species? and how can the
stars explain the origin of gravel, occurring at different heights and
composed of pebbles rounded as if by the motion of running water; or
in what manner can such a cause account for the petrifaction in the
same places of various leaves, sea-weeds, and marine-crabs?"<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>The excavations made in 1517, for repairing the city of Verona,
brought to light a multitude of curious petrifactions, and furnished
matter for speculation to different authors, and among the rest to
Fracastoro,<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> who declared his opinion, that fossil shells had all belonged
to living animals, which had formerly lived and multiplied where there
exuvi&aelig; are now found. He exposed the absurdity of having recourse
to a certain "plastic force," which it was said had power to fashion
stones into organic forms; and with no less cogent arguments, demonstrated
the futility of attributing the situation of the shells in question
to the Mosaic deluge, a theory obstinately defended by some. That
inundation, he observed, was too transient; it consisted principally of
fluviatile waters; and if it had transported shells to great distances,
must have strewed them over the surface, not buried them at vast
depths in the interior of mountains. His clear exposition of the evidence
would have terminated the discussion forever, if the passions of
mankind had not been enlisted in the dispute; and even though doubts
should for a time have remained in some minds, they would speedily
have been removed by the fresh information obtained almost immediately
afterwards, respecting the structure of fossil remains, and of
their living analogues.</p>

<p>But the clear and philosophical views of Fracastoro were disregarded,
and the talent and argumentative powers of the learned were
doomed for three centuries to be wasted in the discussion of these two
simple and preliminary questions: first, whether fossil remains had
ever belonged to living creatures; and, secondly, whether, if this be
admitted, all the phenomena could not be explained by the deluge of
Noah. It had been the general belief of the Christian world down to
the period now under consideration, that the origin of this planet was
not more remote than a few thousand years; and that since the creation
the deluge was the only great catastrophe by which considerable
change had been wrought on the earth's surface. On the other hand,
the opinion was scarcely less general, that the final dissolution of our
system was an event to be looked for at no distant period. The era, it
is true, of the expected millennium had passed away; and for five
hundred years after the fatal hour when the annihilation of the planet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>had been looked for, the monks remained in undisturbed enjoyment of
rich grants of land bequeathed to them by pious donors, who, in the
preamble of deeds beginning "appropinquante mundi termino"&mdash;&mdash;"appropinquante
magno judicii die," left lasting monuments of the
popular delusion.<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>But although in the sixteenth century it had become necessary to
interpret certain prophecies respecting the millennium more liberally,
and to assign a more distant date to the future conflagration of the
world, we find, in the speculations of the early geologists, perpetual
allusion to such an approaching catastrophe; while in all that regarded
the antiquity of the earth, no modification whatever of the opinions of
the dark ages had been effected. Considerable alarm was at first excited
when the attempt was made to invalidate, by physical proofs, an
article of faith so generally received; but there was sufficient spirit of
toleration and candor amongst the Italian ecclesiastics, to allow the subject
to be canvassed with much freedom. They even entered warmly
into the controversy themselves, often favoring different sides of the
question; and however much we may deplore the loss of time and labor
devoted to the defence of untenable positions, it must be conceded that
they displayed far less polemic bitterness than certain writers who followed
them "beyond the Alps," two centuries and a half later.</p>

<h6>CONTROVERSY AS TO THE REAL NATURE OF FOSSIL ORGANIC REMAINS.</h6>

<p><i>Mattioli&mdash;Falloppio.</i>&mdash;The system of scholastic disputations, encouraged
in the universities of the middle ages, had unfortunately
trained men to habits of indefinite argumentation; and they often preferred
absurd and extravagant propositions, because greater skill was
required to maintain them; the end and object of these intellectual
combats being victory, and not truth. No theory could be so far-fetched
or fantastical as not to attract some followers, provided it fell
in with popular notions; and as cosmogonists were not at all restricted,
in building their systems, to the agency of known causes, the opponents
of Fracastoro met his arguments by feigning imaginary causes, which
differed from each other rather in name than in substance. Andrea
Mattioli, for instance, an eminent botanist, the illustrator of Dioscorides,
embraced the notion of Agricola, a skilful German miner, that a certain
"materia pinguis," or "fatty matter," set into fermentation by heat,
gave birth to fossil organic shapes. Yet Mattioli had come to the conclusion,
from his own observations, that porous bodies, such as bones
and shells, might be converted into stone, as being permeable to what
he termed the "lapidifying juice." In like manner, Falloppio of Padua
conceived that petrified shells were generated by fermentation in the
spots where they are found, or that they had in some cases acquired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>their form from "the tumultuous movements of terrestrial exhalations."
Although celebrated as a professor of anatomy, he taught that certain
tusks of elephants, dug up in his time in Apulia, were mere earthy concretions;
and, consistently with these principles, he even went so far as
to consider it probable, that the vases of Monte Testaceo at Rome were
natural impressions stamped in the soil.<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> In the same spirit, Mercati,
who published, in 1574, faithful figures of the fossil shells preserved by
Pope Sixtus V. in the Museum of the Vatican, expressed an opinion that
they were mere stones, which had assumed their peculiar configuration
from the influence of the heavenly bodies; and Olivi of Cremona, who
described the fossil remains of a rich museum at Verona, was satisfied
with considering them as mere "sports of nature."</p>

<p>Some of the fanciful notions of those times were deemed less unreasonable,
as being somewhat in harmony with the Aristotelian theory
of spontaneous generation, then taught in all the schools.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> For men
who had been taught in early youth, that a large proportion of living
animals and plants was formed from the fortuitous concourse of atoms,
or had sprung from the corruption of organic matter, might easily persuade
themselves that organic shapes, often imperfectly preserved in
the interior of solid rocks, owed their existence to causes equally obscure
and mysterious.</p>

<p><i>Cardano</i>, 1552.&mdash;But there were not wanting some who, during the
progress of this century, expressed more sound and sober opinions. The
title of a work of Cardano's, published in 1552, "De Subtilitate" (corresponding
to what would now be called Transcendental Philosophy),
would lead us to expect, in the chapter on minerals, many far-fetched
theories characteristic of that age; but when treating of petrified shells,
he decided that they clearly indicated the former sojourn of the sea
upon the mountains.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a></p>

<p><i>Cesalpino&mdash;Majoli</i>, 1597.&mdash;Cesalpino, a celebrated botanist, conceived
that fossil shells had been left on the land by the retiring sea,
and had concreted into stone during the consolidation of the soil;<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> and
in the following year (1597), Simeone Majoli<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> went still farther; and,
coinciding for the most part with the views of Cesalpino, suggested that
the shells and submarine matter of the Veronese, and other districts,
might have been cast up upon the land by volcanic explosions, like
those which gave rise, in 1538, to Monte Nuovo, near Puzzuoli. This
hint seems to have been the first imperfect attempt to connect the position
of fossil shells with the agency of volcanoes, a system afterwards more
fully developed by Hooke, Lazzaro Moro, Hutton, and other writers.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards, Imperati advocated the animal origin of fossilized
shells, yet admitted that stones could vegetate by force of "an
internal principle;" and, as evidence of this, he referred to the teeth of
fish and spines of echini found petrified.<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span><i>Palissy</i>, 1580.&mdash;Palissy, a French writer on "The Origin of Springs
from Rain-water," and of other scientific works, undertook, in 1580, to
combat the notions of many of his contemporaries in Italy, that petrified
shells had all been deposited by the universal deluge. "He was the
first," said Fontenelle, when, in the French Academy, he pronounced
his eulogy, nearly a century and a half later, "who dared assert," in
Paris, that fossil remains of testacea and fish had once belonged to marine
animals.</p>

<p><i>Fabio Colonna.</i>&mdash;To enumerate the multitude of Italian writers, who
advanced various hypotheses, all equally fantastical, in the early part of
the seventeenth century, would be unprofitably tedious; but Fabio Colonna
deserves to be distinguished; for, although he gave way to the
dogma, that all fossil remains were to be referred to the deluge of Noah,
he resisted the absurd theory of Stelluti, who taught that fossil wood
and ammonites were mere clay, altered into such forms by sulphureous
waters and subterranean heat; and he pointed out the different states
of shells buried in the strata, distinguishing between, first, the mere
mould or impression; second, the cast or nucleus; and, thirdly, the
remains of the shell itself. He had also the merit of being the first to
point out that some of the fossils had belonged to marine and some to
terrestrial testacea.<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p>

<p><i>Steno</i>, 1669.&mdash;But the most remarkable work of that period was
published by Steno, a Dane, once professor of anatomy at Padua, and
who afterwards resided many years at the court of the Grand Duke of
Tuscany. His treatise bears the quaint title of "De Solido intra Solidum
naturaltier contento (1669)," by which the author intended to
express, "On Gems, Crystals, and organic Petrifactions inclosed within
solid Rocks." This work attests the priority of the Italian school in
geological research; exemplifying at the same time the powerful obstacles
opposed, in that age, to the general reception of enlarged views in
the science. It was still a favorite dogma, that the fossil remains of
shells and marine creatures were not of animal origin; an opinion adhered
to by many from their extreme reluctance to believe, that the
earth could have been inhabited by living beings before a great part of
the existing mountains were formed. In reference to this controversy,
Steno had dissected a shark recently taken from the Mediterranean, and
had demonstrated that its teeth and bones were identical with many
fossils found in Tuscany. He had also compared the shells discovered
in the Italian strata with living species, pointed out their resemblance,
and traced the various gradations from shells merely calcined, or which
had only lost their animal gluten, to those petrifactions in which there
was a perfect substitution of stony matter. In his division of mineral
masses, he insisted on the secondary origin of those deposits in which
the spoils of animals or fragments of older rocks were inclosed. He
distinguished between marine formations and those of a fluviatile character,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>the last containing reeds, grasses, or the trunks and branches of
trees. He argued in favor of the original horizontality of sedimentary
deposits, attributing their present inclined and vertical position sometimes
to the escape of subterranean vapors heaving the crust of the
earth from below upwards, and sometimes to the falling in of masses
overlying subterranean cavities.</p>

<p>He declared that he had obtained proof that Tuscany must successively
have acquired six distinct configurations, having been twice covered
by water, twice laid dry with a level, and twice with an irregular
and uneven surface.<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> He displayed great anxiety to reconcile his new
views with Scripture, for which purpose he pointed to certain rocks as
having been formed before the existence of animals and plants: selecting
unfortunately as examples certain formations of limestone and sandstone
in his own country, now known to contain, though sparingly, the
remains of animals and plants,&mdash;strata which do not even rank as the
oldest part of our secondary series. Steno suggested that Moses, when
speaking of the loftiest mountains as having been covered by the deluge,
meant merely the loftiest of the hills then existing, which may not have
been very high. The diluvian waters, he supposed, may have issued
from the interior of the earth into which they had retired, when in the
beginning the land was separated from the sea. These, and other
hypotheses on the same subject, are not calculated to enhance the value
of the treatise, and could scarcely fail to detract from the authority of
those opinions which were sound and legitimate deductions from fact
and observation. They have served, nevertheless, as the germs of many
popular theories of later times, and in an expanded form have been put
forth as original inventions by some of our contemporaries.</p>

<p><i>Scilla</i>, 1670.&mdash;Scilla, a Sicilian painter, published, in 1670, a treatise,
in Latin, on the fossils of Calabria, illustrated by good engravings.
This work proves the continued ascendancy of dogmas often refuted;
for we find the wit and eloquence of the author chiefly directed against
the obstinate incredulity of naturalists as to the organic nature of fossil
shells.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> Like many eminent naturalists of his day, Scilla gave way to the
popular persuasion, that all fossil shells were the effects and proofs of the
Mosaic deluge. It may be doubted whether he was perfectly sincere,
and some of his contemporaries who took the same course were certainly
not so. But so eager were they to root out what they justly considered
an absurd prejudice respecting the nature of organized fossils, that they
seem to have been ready to make any concessions, in order to establish
this preliminary point. Such a compromising policy was short-sighted,
since it was to little purpose that the nature of the documents should at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>length be correctly understood, if men were to be prevented from deducing
fair conclusions from them.</p>

<p><i>Diluvial Theory.</i>&mdash;The theologians who now entered the field in
Italy, Germany, France, and England, were innumerable; and henceforward,
they who refused to subscribe to the position, that all marine
organic remains were proofs of the Mosaic deluge, were exposed to the
imputation of disbelieving the whole of the sacred writings. Scarcely
any step had been made in approximating to sound theories since the
time of Fracastoro, more than a hundred years having been lost, in
writing down the dogma that organized fossils were mere sports of
nature. An additional period of a century and a half was now destined
to be consumed in exploding the hypothesis, that organized fossils had
all been buried in the solid strata by Noah's flood. Never did a theoretical
fallacy, in any branch of science, interfere more seriously with
accurate observation and the systematic classification of facts. In recent
times, we may attribute our rapid progress chiefly to the careful
determination of the order of succession in mineral masses, by means of
their different organic contents, and their regular superposition. But
the old diluvialists were induced by their system to confound all the
groups of strata together instead of discriminating,&mdash;to refer all appearances
to one cause and to one brief period, not to a variety of causes
acting throughout a long succession of epochs. They saw the phenomena
only as they desired to see them, sometimes misrepresenting facts,
and at other times deducing false conclusions from correct data. Under
the influence of such prejudices, three centuries were of as little avail as
a few years in our own times, when we are no longer required to propel
the vessel against the force of an adverse current.</p>

<p>It may be well, therefore, to forewarn the reader, that in tracing the
history of geology from the close of the seventeenth to the end of the
eighteenth century, he must expect to be occupied with accounts of the
retardation, as well as of the advance, of the science. It will be necessary
to point out the frequent revival of exploded errors, and the relapse
from sound to the most absurd opinions; and to dwell on futile
reasoning and visionary hypothesis, because some of the most extravagant
systems were invented or controverted by men of acknowledged
talent. In short, a sketch of the progress of geology is the history of
a constant and violent struggle of new opinions against doctrines sanctioned
by the implicit faith of many generations, and supposed to rest
on scriptural authority. The inquiry, therefore, although highly interesting
to one who studies the philosophy of the human mind, is too
often barren of instruction to him who searches for truths in physical
science.</p>

<p><i>Quirini</i>, 1676.&mdash;Quirini, in 1676,<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> contended, in opposition to Scilla,
that the diluvian waters could not have conveyed heavy bodies to the
summit of mountains, since the agitation of the sea never (as Boyle had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>demonstrated) extended to great depths;<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and still less could the testacea,
as some pretended, have lived in these diluvian waters; for "the
duration of the flood was brief, and <i>the heavy rains must have destroyed
the saltness of the sea!</i>" He was the first writer who ventured to maintain
that the universality of the Mosaic cataclysm ought not to be insisted
upon. As to the nature of petrified shells, he conceived that as
earthy particles united in the sea to form the shells of mollusca, the
same crystallizing process might be effected on the land; and that, in
the latter case, the germs of the animals might have been disseminated
through the substance of the rocks, and afterwards developed by virtue
of humidity. Visionary as was this doctrine, it gained many proselytes
even amongst the more sober reasoners of Italy and Germany; for it
conceded that the position of fossil bodies could not be accounted for by
the diluvial theory.</p>

<p><i>Plot&mdash;Lister</i>, 1678.&mdash;In the mean time, the doctrine that fossil shells
had never belonged to real animals maintained its ground in England,
where the agitation of the question began at a much later period. Dr.
Plot, in his "Natural History of Oxfordshire" (1677), attributed to a
"plastic virtue latent in the earth" the origin of fossil shells and fishes;
and Lister, to his accurate account of British shells, in 1678, added the
fossil species, under the appellation of <i>turbinated and bivalve stones</i>.
"Either," said he, "these were terriginous, or, if otherwise, the animals
they so exactly represent <i>have become extinct</i>." This writer appears to
have been the first who was aware of the continuity over large districts
of the principal groups of strata in the British series, and who proposed
the construction of regular geological maps.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p><i>Leibnitz</i>, 1680.&mdash;The great mathematician Leibnitz published his
"Protog&oelig;a" in 1680. He imagined this planet to have been originally
a burning luminous mass, which ever since its creation has been undergoing
refrigeration. When the outer crust had cooled down sufficiently
to allow the vapors to be condensed, they fell, and formed a universal
ocean, covering the loftiest mountains, and investing the whole globe.
The crust, as it consolidated from a state of fusion, assumed a vesicular
and cavernous structure; and being rent in some places, allowed the
water to rush into the subterranean hollows, whereby the level of the
primeval ocean was lowered. The breaking in of these vast caverns is
supposed to have given rise to the dislocated and deranged position of
the strata "which Steno had described," and the same disruptions communicated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
violent movements to the incumbent waters, whence great
inundations ensued. The waters, after they had been thus agitated,
deposited their sedimentary matter during intervals of quiescence, and
hence the various stony and earthy strata. "We may recognize, therefore,"
says Leibnitz, "a double origin of primitive masses, the one by
refrigeration from igneous fusion, the other by concretion from aqueous
solution."<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> By the repetition of similar causes (the disruption of the
crust and consequent floods), alternations of new strata were produced,
until at length these causes were reduced to a condition of quiescent
equilibrium, and a more permanent state of things was established.<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a></p>

<p><i>Hooke</i>, 1688.&mdash;The "Posthumous Works of Robert Hooke, M. D.,"
well known as a great mathematician and natural philosopher, appeared
in 1705, containing "A Discourse of Earthquakes," which, we are informed
by his editor, was written in 1668, but revised at subsequent
periods.<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Hooke frequently refers to the best Italian and English
authors who wrote before his time on geological subjects; but there
are no passages in his works implying that he participated in the enlarged
views of Steno and Lister, or of his contemporary, Woodward,
in regard to the geographical extent of certain groups of strata. His
treatise, however, is the most philosophical production of that age, in
regard to the causes of former changes in the organic and inorganic
kingdoms of nature.</p>

<p>"However trivial a thing," he says, "a rotten shell may appear to
some, yet these monuments of nature are more certain tokens of antiquity
than coins or medals, since the best of those may be counterfeited
or made by art and design, as may also books, manuscripts, and
inscriptions, as all the learned are now sufficiently satisfied has often
been actually practised," &amp;c.; "and though it must be granted that it
is very difficult to read them (the records of nature) and <i>to raise a
chronology out of them</i>, and to state the intervals of the time wherein
such or such catastrophes and mutations have happened, yet it is not
impossible."<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p>Respecting the extinction of species, Hooke was aware that the
fossil ammonites, nautili, and many other shells and fossil skeletons
found in England, were of different species from any then known; but
he doubted whether the species had become extinct, observing that the
knowledge of naturalists of all the marine species, especially those inhabiting
the deep sea, was very deficient. In some parts of his writings,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
however, he leans to the opinion that species had been lost; and in
speculating on this subject, he even suggests that there might be some
connection between the disappearance of certain kinds of animals and
plants, and the changes wrought by earthquakes in former ages. Some
species, he observes, with great sagacity, are "<i>peculiar to certain places</i>,
and not to be found elsewhere. If, then, such a place had been swallowed
up, it is not improbable but that those animate beings may have
been destroyed with it; and this may be true both of aerial and aquatic
animals; for those animated bodies, whether vegetables or animals,
which were naturally nourished or refreshed by the air, would be destroyed
by the water," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> Turtles, he adds, and such large ammonites
as are found in Portland, seem to have been the productions of
hotter countries; and it is necessary to suppose that England once lay
under the sea within the torrid zone! To explain this and similar phenomena,
he indulges in a variety of speculations concerning changes in
the position of the axis of the earth's rotation, "a shifting of the earth's
centre of gravity, analogous to the revolutions of the magnetic pole,"
&amp;c. None of these conjectures, however, are proposed dogmatically,
but rather in the hope of promoting fresh inquiries and experiments.</p>

<p>In opposition to the prejudices of his age, we find him arguing
against the idea that nature had formed fossil bodies "for no other end
than to play the mimic in the mineral kingdom;"&mdash;maintaining that
figured stones were "really the several bodies they represent, or the
mouldings of them petrified," and not, as some have imagined, 'a lusus
natur&aelig;,' sporting herself in the needless formation of useless beings."<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>It was objected to Hooke, that his doctrine of the extinction of
species derogated from the wisdom and power of the omnipotent Creator;
but he answered, that, as individuals die, there may be some termination
to the duration of a species; and his opinions, he declared,
were not repugnant to Holy Writ: for the Scriptures taught that our
system was degenerating, and tending to its final dissolution; "and as,
when that shall happen, all the species will be lost, why not some at
one time and some at another?"<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>But his principal object was to account for the manner in which shells
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
had been conveyed into the higher parts of "the Alps, Apennines, and
Pyrenean hills, and the interior of continents in general." These and
other appearances, he said, might have been brought about by earthquakes,
"which have turned plains into mountains, and mountains into
plains, seas into land, and land into seas, made rivers where there were
none before, and swallowed up others that formerly were, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and
which, since the creation of the world, have wrought many great changes
on the superficial parts of the earth, and have been the instruments of
placing shells, bones, plants, fishes, and the like, in those places where,
with much astonishment, we find them."<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> This doctrine, it is true, had
been laid down in terms almost equally explicit by Strabo, to explain
the occurrence of fossil shells in the interior of continents, and to that
geographer, and other writers of antiquity, Hooke frequently refers; but
the revival and development of the system was an important step in the
progress of modern science.</p>

<p>Hooke enumerated all the examples known to him of subterranean
disturbance, from "the sad catastrophe of Sodom and Gomorrah," down
to the Chilian earthquake of 1646. The elevating of the bottom of the
sea, the sinking and submersion of the land, and most of the inequalities
of the earth's surface, might, he said, be accounted for by the agency
of these subterranean causes. He mentions that the coast near Naples
<i>was raised during the eruption of Monte Nuovo</i>; and that, in 1591, land
rose in the island of St. Michael, during an eruption: and although it
would be more difficult, he says, to prove, he does not doubt but that
there had been as many earthquakes in the parts of the earth under the
ocean, as in the parts of the dry land; in confirmation of which, he
mentions the immeasurable depth of the sea near some volcanoes. To
attest the extent of simultaneous subterranean movements, he refers to
an earthquake in the West Indies, in the year 1690, where the space of
earth raised, or "struck upwards," by the shock, exceeded, he affirms,
the length of the Alps and Pyrenees.</p>

<p><i>Hooke's diluvial Theory.</i>&mdash;As Hooke declared the favorite hypothesis
of the day, "that marine fossil bodies were to be referred to Noah's
flood," to be wholly untenable, he appears to have felt himself called
upon to substitute a diluvial theory of his own, and thus he became involved
in countless difficulties and contradictions. "During the great
catastrophe," he said, "there might have been a changing of that part
which was before dry land into sea by sinking, and of that which was
sea into dry land by raising, and marine bodies might have been buried
in sediment beneath the ocean, in the interval between the creation and
the deluge."<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Then follows a disquisition on the separation of the land
from the waters, mentioned in Genesis; during which operation some
places of the shell of the earth were forced outwards, and others pressed
downwards or inwards, &amp;c. His diluvial hypothesis very much resembled
that of Steno, and was entirely opposed to the fundamental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
principles professed by him, that he would explain the former changes
of the earth <i>in a more natural manner</i> than others had done. When,
in despite of this declaration, he required a former "crisis of nature,"
and taught that earthquakes had become debilitated, and that the Alps,
Andes, and other chains, had been lifted up in a few months, he was
compelled to assume so rapid a rate of change, that his machinery appeared
scarcely less extravagant than that of his most fanciful predecessors.
For this reason, perhaps, his whole theory of earthquakes met
with undeserved neglect.</p>

<p><i>Ray</i>, 1692.&mdash;One of his contemporaries, the celebrated naturalist,
Ray, participated in the same desire to explain geological phenomena
by reference to causes less hypothetical than those usually resorted to.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>
In his essay on "Chaos and Creation," he proposed a system, agreeing
in its outline, and in many of its details, with that of Hooke; but his
knowledge of natural history enabled him to elucidate the subject with
various original observations. Earthquakes, he suggested, might have
been the second causes employed at the creation, in separating the land
from the waters, and in gathering the waters together into one place.
He mentions, like Hooke, the earthquake of 1646, which had violently
shaken the Andes for some hundreds of leagues, and made many alterations
therein. In assigning a cause for the general deluge, he preferred
a change in the earth's centre of gravity to the introduction of earthquakes.
Some unknown cause, he said, might have forced the subterranean
waters outwards, as was, perhaps, indicated by "the breaking
up of the fountains of the great deep."</p>

<p>Ray was one of the first of our writers who enlarged upon the effects
of running water upon the land, and of the encroachment of the sea
upon the shores. So important did he consider the agency of these
causes, that he saw in them an indication of the tendency of our system
to its final dissolution; and he wondered why the earth did not proceed
more rapidly towards a general submersion beneath the sea, when so
much matter was carried down by rivers, or undermined in the sea-cliffs.
We perceive clearly from his writings, that the gradual decline of our
system, and its future consummation by fire, was held to be as necessary
an article of faith by the orthodox, as was the recent origin of our planet.
His discourses, like those of Hooke, are highly interesting, as attesting
the familiar association in the minds of philosophers, in the age of Newton,
of questions in physics and divinity. Ray gave an unequivocal proof
of the sincerity of his mind, by sacrificing his preferment in the church,
rather than take an oath against the Covenanters, which he could not
reconcile with his conscience. His reputation, moreover, in the scientific
world placed him high above the temptation of courting popularity, by
pandering to the physico-theological taste of his age. It is, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
curious to meet with so many citations from the Christian fathers and
prophets in his essays on physical science&mdash;to find him in one page proceeding,
by the strict rules of induction, to explain the former changes
of the globe, and in the next gravely entertaining the question, whether
the sun and stars, and the whole heavens, shall be annihilated, together
with the earth, at the era of the grand conflagration.</p>

<p><i>Woodward, 1695.</i>&mdash;Among the contemporaries of Hooke and Ray,
Woodward, a professor of medicine, had acquired the most extensive
information respecting the geological structure of the crust of the earth.
He had examined many parts of the British strata with minute attention;
and his systematic collection of specimens, bequeathed to the
University of Cambridge, and still preserved there as arranged by him,
shows how far he had advanced in ascertaining the order of superposition.
From the great number of facts collected by him, we might have
expected his theoretical views to be more sound and enlarged than
those of his contemporaries; but in his anxiety to accommodate all observed
phenomena to the scriptural account of the Creation and Deluge,
he arrived at most erroneous results. He conceived "the whole terrestrial
globe to have been taken to pieces and dissolved at the flood, and
the strata to have settled down from this promiscuous mass as any earthy
sediment from a fluid."<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> In corroboration of these views he insisted
upon the fact, that "marine bodies are lodged in the strata according
to the order of their gravity, the heavier shells in stone, the lighter in
chalk, and so of the rest."<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> Ray immediately exposed the unfounded
nature of this assertion, remarking truly that fossil bodies "are often
mingled, heavy with light, in the same stratum;" and he even went so
far as to say, that Woodward "must have invented the phenomena for
the sake of confirming his bold and strange hypothesis"<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>&mdash;a strong expression
from the pen of a contemporary.</p>

<p><i>Burnet, 1690.</i>&mdash;At the same time Burnet published his "Theory of
the Earth."<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> The title is most characteristic of the age,&mdash;"The Sacred
Theory of the Earth; containing an Account of the Original of the
Earth, and of all the general Changes which it hath already undergone,
or is to undergo, till the Consummation of all Things." Even Milton
had scarcely ventured in his poem to indulge his imagination so freely
in painting scenes of the Creation and Deluge, Paradise and Chaos.
He explained why the primeval earth enjoyed a perpetual spring before
the flood! showed how the crust of the globe was fissured by "the
sun's rays," so that it burst, and thus the diluvial waters were let loose
from a supposed central abyss. Not satisfied with these themes, he
derived from the books of the inspired writers, and even from heathen
authorities, prophetic views of the future revolutions of the globe, gave
a most terrific description of the general conflagration, and proved that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
a new heaven and a new earth will rise out of a <i>second chaos</i>&mdash;after
which will follow the blessed millennium.</p>

<p>The reader should be informed, that, according to the opinion of many
respectable writers of that age, there was good scriptural ground for
presuming that the garden bestowed upon our first parents was not on
the earth itself, but above the clouds, in the middle region between our
planet and the moon. Burnet approaches with becoming gravity the
discussion of so important a topic. He was willing to concede that the
geographical position of Paradise was not in Mesopotamia, yet he maintained
that it was upon the earth, and in the southern hemisphere, near the
equinoctial line. Butler selected this conceit as a fair mark for his satire,
when, amongst the numerous accomplishments of Hudibras, he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>
"He knew the seat of Paradise,
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Could tell in what degree it lies;</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">And, as he was disposed, could prove it</span>
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">Below the moon, or else above it."</span>
</p>

<p>Yet the same monarch, who is said never to have slept without Butler's
poem under his pillow, was so great an admirer and patron of Burnet's
book, that he ordered it to be translated from the Latin into English.
The style of the "Sacred Theory" was eloquent, and the book displayed
powers of invention of no ordinary stamp. It was, in fact, a
fine historical romance, as Buffon afterwards declared; but it was
treated as a work of profound science in the time of its author, and was
panegyrized by Addison in a Latin ode, while Steele praised it in the
"Spectator."</p>

<p><i>Whiston, 1696.</i>&mdash;Another production of the same school, and equally
characteristic of the time, was that of Whiston, entitled, "A New
Theory of the Earth; wherein the Creation of the world in Six Days,
the Universal Deluge, and the General Conflagration, as laid down in
the Holy Scriptures, are shown to be perfectly agreeable to Reason and
Philosophy." He was at first a follower of Burnet; but his faith in
the infallibility of that writer was shaken by the declared opinion of
Newton, that there was every presumption in astronomy against any
former change in the inclination of the earth's axis. This was a leading
dogma in Burnet's system, though not original, for it was borrowed
from an Italian, Alessandro degli Alessandri, who had suggested it in
the beginning of the fifteenth century, to account for the former occupation
of the present continents by the sea. La Place has since strengthened
the arguments of Newton, against the probability of any former
revolution of this kind.</p>

<p>The remarkable comet of 1680 was fresh in the memory of every
one when Whiston first began his cosmological studies; and the principal
novelty of his speculations consisted in attributing the deluge to the
near approach to the earth of one of these erratic bodies. Having
ascribed an increase of the waters to this source, he adopted Woodward's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
theory, supposing all stratified deposits to have resulted from
the "chaotic sediment of the flood." Whiston was one of the first who
ventured to propose that the text of Genesis should be interpreted differently
from its ordinary acceptation, so that the doctrine of the earth
having existed long previous to the creation of man might no longer be
regarded as unorthodox. He had the art to throw an air of plausibility
over the most improbable parts of his theory, and seemed to be proceeding
in the most sober manner, and, by the aid of mathematical demonstration,
to the establishment of his various propositions. Locke
pronounced a panegyric on his theory, commending him for having explained
so many wonderful and before inexplicable things. His book,
as well as Burnet's, was attacked and refuted by Keill.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> Like all who
introduced purely hypothetical causes to account for natural phenomena,
Whiston retarded the progress of truth, diverting men from the
investigation of the laws of sublunary nature, and inducing them to
waste time in speculations on the power of comets to drag the waters
of the ocean over the land&mdash;on the condensation of the vapors of their
tails into water, and other matters equally edifying.</p>

<p><i>Hutchinson, 1724.</i>&mdash;John Hutchinson, who had been employed by
Woodward in making his collection of fossils, published afterwards, in
1724, the first part of his "Moses's Principia," wherein he ridiculed
Woodward's hypothesis. He and his numerous followers were accustomed
to declaim loudly against human learning; and they maintained
that the Hebrew Scriptures, when rightly translated, comprised a perfect
system of natural philosophy, for which reason they objected to the
Newtonian theory of gravitation.</p>

<p><i>Celsius.</i>&mdash;Andrea Celsius, the Swedish astronomer, published about
this time his remarks on the gradual diminution and sinking of the
waters in the Baltic, to which I shall have occasion to advert more particularly
in the sequel (ch. 29).</p>

<p><i>Scheuchzer, 1708.</i>&mdash;In Germany, in the mean time, Scheuchzer published
his "Complaint and Vindication of the Fishes" (1708), "Piscium
Querel&aelig; et Vindici&aelig;," a work of zoological merit, in which he gave
some good plates and descriptions of fossil fish. Among other conclusions
he labored to prove that the earth had been remodelled at the
deluge. Pluche, also, in 1732, wrote to the same effect; while Holbach,
in 1753, after considering the various attempts to refer all the ancient
formations to the flood of Noah, exposed the inadequacy of this
cause.</p>

<p><i>Italian Geologists&mdash;Vallisneri.</i>&mdash;I return with pleasure to the geologists
of Italy, who preceded, as has been already shown, the naturalists
of other countries in their investigations into the ancient history of
the earth, and who still maintained a decided pre-eminence. They refuted
and ridiculed the physico-theological systems of Burnet, Whiston,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
and Woodward;<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> while Vallisneri,<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> in his comments on the Woodwardian
theory, remarked how much the interests of religion, as well as those
of sound philosophy, had suffered by perpetually mixing up the sacred
writings with questions in physical science. The works of this author
were rich in original observations. He attempted the first general
sketch of the marine deposits of Italy, their geographical extent, and
most characteristic organic remains. In his treatise "On the Origin of
Springs," he explained their dependence on the order, and often on the
dislocations, of the strata, and reasoned philosophically against the
opinions of those who regarded the disordered state of the earth's crust
as exhibiting signs of the wrath of God for the sins of man. He found
himself under the necessity of contending, in his preliminary chapter,
against St. Jerome, and four other principal interpreters of Scripture,
besides several professors of divinity, "that springs did not flow by subterranean
siphons and cavities from the sea upwards, losing their saltness
in the passage," for this theory had been made to rest on the infallible
testimony of Holy Writ.</p>

<p>Although reluctant to generalize on the rich materials accumulated
in his travels, Vallisneri had been so much struck with the remarkable
continuity of the more recent marine strata, from one end of Italy to the
other, that he came to the conclusion that the ocean formerly extended
over the whole earth, and after abiding there for a long time, had gradually
subsided. This opinion, however untenable, was a great step beyond
Woodward's diluvian hypothesis, against which Vallisneri, and
after him all the Tuscan geologists, uniformly contended, while it was
warmly supported by the members of the Institute of Bologna.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>Among others of that day, Spada, a priest of Grezzana, in 1737,
wrote to prove that the petrified marine bodies near Verona were not
diluvian.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> Mattani drew a similar inference from the shells of Volterra
and other places; while Costantini, on the other hand, whose observations
on the valley of the Brenta and other districts were not without
value, undertook to vindicate the truth of the deluge, as also to prove
that Italy had been peopled by the descendants of Japhet.<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p><i>Moro</i>, 1740.&mdash;Lazzaro Moro, in his work (published in 1740) "On the
Marine Bodies which are found in the Mountains,"<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> attempted to apply
the theory of earthquakes, as expounded by Strabo, Pliny, and
other ancient authors, with whom he was familiar, to the geological
phenomena described by Vallisneri.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> His attention was awakened to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
the elevating power of subterranean forces by a remarkable phenomenon
which happened in his own time, and which had also been noticed by
Vallisneri in his letters. A new island rose in 1707 from deep water in
the Gulf of Santorin, in the Mediterranean, during continued shocks of
an earthquake, and, increasing rapidly in size, grew in less than a month
to be half a mile in circumference, and about twenty-five feet above
high-water mark. It was soon afterwards covered by volcanic ejections,
but, when first examined, it was found to be a white rock, bearing on
its surface living oysters and crustacea. In order to ridicule the various
theories then in vogue, Moro ingeniously supposes the arrival on
this new island of a party of naturalists ignorant of its recent origin.
One immediately points to the marine shells, as proofs of the universal
deluge; another argues that they demonstrate the former residence of
the sea upon the mountains; a third dismisses them as mere <i>sports of
nature</i>; while a fourth affirms that they were born and nourished
within the rock in ancient caverns, into which salt water had been raised
in the shape of vapor by the action of subterranean heat.</p>

<p>Moro pointed with great judgment to the <i>faults</i> and dislocations of
the strata described by Vallisneri, in the Alps and other chains, in confirmation
of his doctrine, that the continents had been heaved up by
subterranean movements. He objected, on solid grounds, to the hypothesis
of Burnet and of Woodward; yet he ventured so far to disregard
the protest of Vallisneri, as to undertake the adaptation of every part of
his own system to the Mosaic account of the creation. On the third
day, he said, the globe was everywhere covered to the same depth by
fresh water; and when it pleased the Supreme Being that the dry land
should appear, volcanic explosions broke up the smooth and regular
surface of the earth composed of primary rocks. These rose in mountain
masses above the waves, and allowed melted metals and salts to
ascend through fissures. The sea gradually acquired its saltness from
volcanic exhalations, and, while it became more circumscribed in area,
increased in depth. Sand and ashes ejected by volcanoes were regularly
disposed along the bottom of the ocean, and formed the secondary
strata, which in their turn were lifted up by earthquakes. We need
not follow this author in tracing the progress of the creation of vegetables
and animals on the other days of creation; but, upon the whole, it
may be remarked, that few of the old cosmological theories had been
conceived with so little violation of known analogies.</p>

<p><i>Generelli's illustrations of Moro</i>, 1749.&mdash;The style of Moro was extremely
prolix, and, like Hutton, who, at a later period, advanced many
of the same views, he stood in need of an illustrator. The Scotch geologist
was hardly more fortunate in the advocacy of Playfair, than was
Moro in numbering amongst his admirers Cirillo Generelli, who, nine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
years afterwards, delivered at a sitting of Academicians at Cremona a
spirited exposition of his theory. This learned Carmelitan friar does not
pretend to have been an original observer, but he had studied sufficiently
to enable him to confirm the opinions of Moro by arguments from other
writers; and his selection of the doctrines then best established is so
judicious, that a brief abstract of them cannot fail to be acceptable, as
illustrating the state of geology in Europe, and in Italy in particular,
before the middle of the last century.</p>

<p>The bowels of the earth, says he, have carefully preserved the memorials
of past events, and this truth the marine productions so frequent
in the hills attest. From the reflections of Lazzaro Moro, we may assure
ourselves that these are the effects of earthquakes in past times,
which have changed vast spaces of sea into terra firma, and inhabited
lands into seas. In this, more than in any other department of physics,
are observations and experiments indispensable, and we must diligently
consider facts. The land is known, wherever we make excavations, to
be composed of different strata or soils placed one above the other, some
of sand, some of rock, some of chalk, others of marl, coal, pummice,
gypsum, lime, and the rest. These ingredients are sometimes pure, and
sometimes confusedly intermixed. Within are often imprisoned different
marine fishes, like dried mummies, and more frequently shells, crustacea,
corals, plants, &amp;c., not only in Italy, but in France, Germany,
England, Africa, Asia, and America;&mdash;sometimes in the lowest, sometimes
in the loftiest beds of the earth, some upon the mountains, some
in deep mines, others near the sea, and others hundreds of miles distant
from it. Woodward conjectured that these marine bodies might be
found everywhere; but there are rocks in which none of them occur,
as is sufficiently attested by Vallisneri and Marsilli. The remains of
fossil animals consist chiefly of their more solid parts, and the most
rocky strata must have been soft when such exuvi&aelig; were inclosed in
them. Vegetable productions are found in different states of maturity,
indicating that they were imbedded in different seasons. Elephants,
elks, and other terrestrial quadrupeds, have been found in England and
elsewhere, in superficial strata, never covered by the sea. Alternations
are rare, yet not without example, of marine strata, with those which
contain marshy and terrestrial productions. Marine animals are arranged
in the subterraneous beds with admirable order, in distinct
groups, oysters here, dentalia or corals there, &amp;c., as now, according to
Marsilli,<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> on the shores of the Adriatic. We must abandon the doctrine,
once so popular, which denies that organized fossils were derived
from living beings, and we cannot account for their present position by
the ancient theory of Strabo, nor by that of Leibnitz, nor by the universal
deluge, as explained by Woodward and others; "nor is it reasonable
to call the Deity capriciously upon the stage, and to make him
work miracles for the sake of confirming our preconceived
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
hypothesis."&mdash;"I hold in utter abomination, most learned Academicians! those
systems which are built with their foundations in the air, and cannot be
propped up without a miracle; and I undertake, with the assistance of
Moro, to explain to you how these marine animals were transported
into the mountains by natural causes."<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<p>A brief abstract then follows of Moro's theory, by which, says Generelli,
we may explain all the phenomena, as Vallisneri so ardently desired,
"<i>without violence, without fictions, without hypothesis, without
miracles</i>."<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> The Carmelitan then proceeds to struggle against an obvious
objection to Moro's system, considered as a method of explaining
the revolutions of the earth, <i>naturally</i>. If earthquakes have been the
agents of such mighty changes, how does it happen that their effects
since the times of history have been so inconsiderable? This same difficulty
had, as we have seen, presented itself to Hooke, half a century
before, and forced him to resort to a former "crisis of nature:" but
Generelli defended his position by showing how numerous were the
accounts of eruptions and earthquakes, of new islands, and of elevations
and subsidences of land, and yet how much greater a number of
like events must have been unattested and unrecorded during the last
six thousand years. He also appealed to Vallisneri as an authority to
prove that the mineral masses containing shells, bore, upon the whole,
but a small proportion to those rocks which were destitute of organic
remains; and the latter, says the learned monk, might have been created
as they now exist, <i>in the beginning</i>.</p>

<p>Generelli then describes the continual waste of mountains and continents,
by the action of rivers and torrents, and concludes with these
eloquent and original observations:&mdash;"Is it possible that this waste
should have continued for six thousand, and <i>perhaps</i> a greater number
of years, and that the mountains should remain so great, unless their
ruins have been repaired? Is it credible that the Author of Nature
should have founded the world upon such laws, as that the dry land
should forever be growing smaller, and at last become wholly submerged
beneath the waters? Is it credible that, amid so many created
things, the mountains alone should daily diminish in number and bulk,
without there being any repair of their losses? This would be contrary
to that order of Providence which is seen to reign in all other things in
the universe. Wherefore I deem it just to conclude, that the same
cause which, in the beginning of time, raised mountains from the abyss,
has down to the present day continued to produce others, in order to
restore from time to time the losses of all such as sink down in different
places, or are rent asunder, or in other way suffer disintegration. If
this be admitted, we can easily understand why there should now be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
found upon many mountains so great a number of crustacea and other
marine animals."</p>

<p>In the above extract, I have not merely enumerated the opinions and
facts which are confirmed by recent observation, suppressing all that
has since proved to be erroneous, but have given a faithful abridgment
of the entire treatise, with the omission only of Moro's hypothesis, which
Generelli adopted, with all its faults and excellences. The reader will
therefore remark, that although this admirable essay embraces so large
a portion of the principal objects of geological research, it makes no
allusion to the extinction of certain classes of animals; and it is evident
that no opinions on this head had, at that time, gained a firm footing in
Italy. That Lister and other English naturalists should long before
have declared in favor of the loss of species, while Scilla and most of
his countrymen hesitated, was perhaps natural, since the Italian museums
were filled with fossil shells belonging to species of which a great
portion did actually exist in the Mediterranean; whereas the English
collectors could obtain no recent species from such of their own strata
as were then explored.</p>

<p>The weakest point in Moro's system consisted in deriving <i>all</i> the stratified
rocks from volcanic ejections; an absurdity which his opponents
took care to expose, especially Vito Amici.<a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> Moro seems to have been
misled by his anxious desire to represent the formation of secondary
rocks as having occupied an extremely short period, while at the same
time he wished to employ known agents in nature. To imagine torrents,
rivers, currents, partial floods, and all the operations of moving
water, to have gone on exerting an energy many thousand times greater
than at present, would have appeared preposterous and incredible, and
would have required a hundred violent hypotheses; but we are so unacquainted
with the true sources of subterranean disturbances, that their
former violence may in theory be multiplied indefinitely, without its
being possible to prove the same manifest contradiction or absurdity in
the conjecture. For this reason, perhaps, Moro preferred to derive the
materials of the strata from volcanic ejections, rather than from transportation
by running water.</p>

<p><i>Marsilli.</i>&mdash;Marsilli, whose work is alluded to by Generelli, had been
prompted to institute inquiries into the bed of the Adriatic, by discovering,
in the territory of Parma (what Spada had observed near Verona,
and Schiavo in Sicily), that fossil shells were not scattered through the
rocks at random, but disposed in regular order, according to certain
genera and species.</p>

<p><i>Vitaliano Donati</i>, 1750.&mdash;But with a view of throwing further light
upon these questions, Donati, in 1750, undertook a more extensive investigation
of the Adriatic, and discovered, by numerous soundings, that deposits
of sand, marl, and tufaceous incrustations, most strictly analogous
to those of the Subapennine hills, were in the act of accumulating there.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
He ascertained that there were no shells in some of the submarine
tracts, while in other places they lived together in families, particularly
the genera Arca, Pecten, Venus, Murex, and some others. He also
states that in divers localities he found a mass composed of corals,
shells, and crustaceous bodies of different species, confusedly blended
with earth, sand, and gravel. At the depth of a foot or more, the
organic substances were entirely petrified and reduced to marble; at
less than a foot from the surface, they approached nearer to their natural
state; while at the surface they were alive, or, if dead, in a good
state of preservation.</p>

<p><i>Baldassari</i>.&mdash;A contemporary naturalist, Baldassari, had shown that
the organic remains in the tertiary marls of the Siennese territory were
grouped in families, in a manner precisely similar to that above alluded
to by Donati.</p>

<p><i>Buffon</i>, 1749.&mdash;Buffon first made known his theoretical views concerning
the former changes of the earth, in his Natural History, published
in 1749. He adopted the theory of an original volcanic nucleus,
together with the universal ocean of Leibnitz. By this aqueous envelope
the highest mountains were once covered. Marine currents then
acted violently, and formed horizontal strata, by washing away solid
matter in some parts, and depositing it in others; they also excavated
deep submarine valleys. The level of the ocean was then depressed by
the entrance of a part of its waters into subterranean caverns, and thus
some land was left dry. Buffon seems not to have profited, like Leibnitz
and Moro, by the observations of Steno, or he could not have imagined
that the strata were generally horizontal, and that those which
contain organic remains had never been disturbed since the era of their
formation. He was conscious of the great power annually exerted by
rivers and marine currents in transporting earthy materials to lower
levels, and he even contemplated the period when they would destroy
all the present continents. Although in geology he was not an original
observer, his genius enabled him to render his hypothesis attractive;
and by the eloquence of his style, and the boldness of his speculations,
he awakened curiosity, and provoked a spirit of inquiry amongst his
countrymen.</p>

<p>Soon after the publication of his "Natural History," in which was
included his "Theory of the Earth," he received an official letter (dated
January, 1751) from the Sorbonne, or Faculty of Theology in Paris,
informing him that fourteen propositions in his works "were reprehensible,
and contrary to the creed of the church." The first of these obnoxious
passages, and the only one relating to geology, was as follows:&mdash;"The
waters of the sea have produced the mountains and valleys of the
land&mdash;the waters of the heavens, reducing all to a level, will at last deliver
the whole land over to the sea, and the sea successively prevailing
over the land, will leave dry new continents like those which we inhabit."
Buffon was invited by the College, in very courteous terms, to
send in an explanation, or rather a recantation of his unorthodox opinions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
To this he submitted; and a general assembly of the Faculty
having approved of his "Declaration," he was required to publish it in
his next work. The document begins with these words:&mdash;"I declare
that I had no intention to contradict the text of Scripture; that I believe
most firmly all therein related about the creation, both as to order
of time and matter of fact; and <i>I abandon every thing in my book respecting
the foundation of the earth</i>, and, generally, all which may be
contrary to the narration of Moses."<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>The grand principle which Buffon was called upon to renounce was
simply this,&mdash;that the present mountains and valleys of the earth are
due to secondary causes, and that the same causes will in time destroy
all the continents, hills, and valleys, and reproduce others like them.
Now, whatever may be the defects of many of his views, it is no longer
controverted that the present continents are of secondary origin. The
doctrine is as firmly established as the earth's rotation on its axis; and
that the land now elevated above the level of the sea will not endure
forever, is an opinion which gains ground daily, in proportion as we
enlarge our experience of the changes now in progress.</p>

<p><i>Targioni</i>, 1751.&mdash;Targioni, in his voluminous "Travels in Tuscany,
1751 and 1754," labored to fill up the sketch of the geology of that
region left by Steno sixty years before. Notwithstanding a want of
arrangement and condensation in his memoirs, they contained a rich
store of faithful observations. He has not indulged in many general
views, but in regard to the origin of valleys, he was opposed to the
theory of Buffon, who attributed them principally to submarine currents.
The Tuscan naturalist labored to show that both the larger and smaller
valleys of the Apennines were excavated by rivers and floods, caused
by the bursting of the barriers of lakes, after the retreat of the ocean.
He also maintained that the elephants and other quadrupeds, so frequent
in the lacustrine and alluvial deposits of Italy, had inhabited that
peninsula; and had not been transported thither, as some had conceived,
by Hannibal or the Romans, nor by what they were pleased to term
"a catastrophe of nature."</p>

<p><i>Lehman</i>, 1756.&mdash;In the year 1756 the treatise of Lehman, a German
mineralogist, and director of the Prussian mines, appeared, who also
divided mountains into three classes: the first, those formed with the
world, and prior to the creation of animals, and which contained no
fragments of other rocks; the second class, those which resulted from
the partial destruction of the primary rocks by a general revolution;
and a third class, resulting from local revolutions, and in part from the
deluge of Noah.</p>

<p>A French translation of this work appeared in 1759, in the preface
of which, the translator displays very enlightened views respecting the
operations of earthquakes, as well as of the aqueous causes.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span><i>Gesner</i>, 1758.&mdash;In this year Gesner, the botanist, of Zurich, published
an excellent treatise on petrifactions, and the changes of the
earth which they testify.<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> After a detailed enumeration of the various
classes of fossils of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, and remarks on
the different states in which they are found petrified, he considers the
geological phenomena connected with them; observing, that some, like
those of &OElig;ningen, resembled the testacea, fish, and plants indigenous
in the neighboring region;<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> while some, such as ammonites, gryphites,
belemnites, and other shells, are either of unknown species, or found
only in the Indian and other distant seas. In order to elucidate the
structure of the earth, he gives sections, from Verenius, Buffon, and
others, obtained in digging wells; distinguishes between horizontal and
inclined strata; and, in speculating on the causes of these appearances,
mentions Donati's examination of the bed of the Adriatic; the filling
up of lakes and seas by sediment; the imbedding of shells now in progress;
and many known effects of earthquakes, such as the sinking
down of districts, or the heaving up of the bed of the sea, so as to form
new islands, and lay dry strata containing petrifactions. The ocean, he
says, deserts its shores in many countries, as on the borders of the
Baltic; but the rate of recession has been so slow in the last 2000
years, that to allow the Apennines, whose summits are filled with marine
shells, to emerge to their present height, would have required about
80,000 years,&mdash;a lapse of time ten times greater, or more, than the age
of the universe. We must therefore refer the phenomenon to the command
of the Deity, related by Moses, that "the waters should be
gathered together in one place, and the dry land appear." Gesner
adopted the views of Leibnitz, to account for the retreat of the primeval
ocean: his essay displays much erudition; and the opinions of preceding
writers of Italy, Germany, and England, are commented upon with
fairness and discrimination.</p>

<p><i>Arduino</i>, 1759.&mdash;In the year following, Arduino,<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> in his memoirs on
the mountains of Padua, Vicenza, and Verona, deduced, from original
observations, the distinction of rocks into primary, secondary, and tertiary,
and showed that in those districts there had been a succession of
submarine volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p><i>Michell</i>, 1760.&mdash;In the following year (1760) the Rev. John Michell,
Woodwardian Professor of Mineralogy at Cambridge, published in the
Philosophical Transactions, an Essay on the Cause and Phenomena of
Earthquakes.<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> His attention had been drawn to this subject by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
great earthquake of Lisbon in 1755. He advanced many original and
philosophical views respecting the propagation of subterranean movements,
and the caverns and fissures wherein steam might be generated.
In order to point out the application of his theory to the structure of
the globe, he was led to describe the arrangement and disturbance of
the strata, their usual horizontality in low countries, and their contortions
and fractured state in the neighborhood of mountain chains. He also explained,
with surprising accuracy, the relations of the central ridges of
older rocks to the "long narrow slips of similar earth, stones, and minerals,"
which are parallel to these ridges. In his generalizations, derived
in great part from his own observations on the geological structure of
Yorkshire, he anticipated many of the views more fully developed by
later naturalists.</p>

<p><i>Catcott</i>, 1761.&mdash;Michell's papers were entirely free from all physico-theological
disquisitions, but some of his contemporaries were still earnestly
engaged in defending or impugning the Woodwardian hypothesis.
We find many of these writings referred to by Catcott, a Hutchinsonian,
who published a "Treatise on the Deluge" in 1761. He labored particularly
to refute an explanation offered by his contemporary, Bishop
Clayton, of the Mosaic writings. That prelate had declared that the
deluge "could not be literally true, save in respect to that part where
Noah lived before the flood." Catcott insisted on the universality of
the deluge, and referred to traditions of inundations mentioned by ancient
writers, or by travellers, in the East Indies, China, South America,
and other countries. This part of his book is valuable, although it is
not easy to see what bearing the traditions have, if admitted to be authentic,
on the Bishop's argument, since no evidence is adduced to prove
that the catastrophes were contemporaneous events, while some of them
are expressly represented by ancient authors to have occurred in succession.</p>

<p><i>Fortis&mdash;Odoardi</i>, 1761.&mdash;The doctrines of Arduino, above adverted
to, were afterwards confirmed by Fortis and Desmarest, in their travels
in the same country; and they, as well as Baldassari, labored to complete
the history of the Subapennine strata. In the work of Odoardi,<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a>
there was also a clear argument in favor of the distinct ages of the older
Apennine strata, and the Subapennine formations of more recent origin.
He pointed out that the strata of these two groups were <i>unconformable</i>,
and must have been the deposits of different seas at distant
periods of time.</p>

<p><i>Raspe</i>, 1763.&mdash;A history of the new islands, by Raspe, a Hanoverian,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
appeared in 1763, in Latin.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> In this work, all the authentic accounts
of earthquakes which had produced permanent changes on the
solid parts of the earth were collected together and examined with judicious
criticism. The best systems which had been proposed concerning
the ancient history of the globe, both by ancient and modern writers,
are reviewed; and the merits and defects of the doctrines of Hooke,
Ray, Moro, Buffon, and others, fairly estimated. Great admiration is
expressed for the hypothesis of Hooke, and his explanation of the origin
of the strata is shown to have been more correct than Moro's, while their
theory of the effects of earthquakes was the same. Raspe had not seen
Michell's memoirs, and his views concerning the geological structure of
the earth were perhaps less enlarged; yet he was able to add many
additional arguments in favor of Hook's theory, and to render it, as he
said, a nearer approach to what Hooke would have written had he lived
in later times. As to the periods wherein all the earthquakes happened,
to which we owe the elevation of various parts of our continents and
islands, Raspe says he pretends not to assign their duration, still less to
defend Hooke's suggestion, that the convulsions almost all took place
during the deluge of Noah. He adverts to the apparent indications of
the former tropical heat of the climate of Europe, and the changes in
the species of animals and plants, as among the most obscure and difficult
problems in geology. In regard to the islands raised from the sea,
within the times of history or tradition, he declares that some of them
were composed of strata containing organic remains, and that they were
not, as Buffon had asserted, made of mere volcanic matter. His work
concludes with an eloquent exhortation to naturalists to examine the isles
which rose, in 1707, in the Grecian Archipelago, and, in 1720, in the Azores,
and not to neglect such splendid opportunities of studying nature "in
the act of parturition." That Hooke's writings should have been neglected
for more than half a century, was matter of astonishment to
Raspe; but it is still more wonderful that his own luminous exposition
of that theory should, for more than another half century, have excited
so little interest.</p>

<p><i>Fuchsel</i>, 1762 and 1773.&mdash;Fuchsel, a German physician, published,
in 1762, a geological description of the country between the Thuringerwald
and the Hartz, and a memoir on the environs of Rudelstadt;<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> and
afterwards, in 1773, a theoretical work on the ancient history of the
earth and of man.<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> He had evidently advanced considerably beyond
his predecessor Lehman, and was aware of the distinctness, both as to
position and fossil contents, of several groups of strata of different ages,
corresponding to the secondary formations now recognized by geologists
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
in various parts of Germany. He supposed the European continents to
have remained covered by the sea until the formation of the marine strata,
called in Germany "muschelkalk," at the same time that the terrestrial
plants of many European deposits, attested the existence of dry land
which bordered the ancient sea; land which, therefore, must have occupied
the place of the present ocean. The pre-existing continent had
been <i>gradually</i> swallowed up by the sea, different parts having subsided
in succession into subterranean caverns. All the sedimentary strata
were originally horizontal, and their present state of derangement must
be referred to subsequent oscillations of the ground.</p>

<p>As there were plants and animals in the ancient periods, so also there
must have been men, but they did not all descend from one pair, but
were created at various points on the earth's surface; and the number
of these distinct birth-places was as great as are the original languages
of nations.</p>

<p>In the writings of Fuchsel we see a strong desire manifested to explain
geological phenomena as far as possible by reference to the agency
of known causes; and although some of his speculations were fanciful,
his views coincide much more nearly with those now generally adopted,
than the theories afterwards promulgated by Werner and his followers.</p>

<p><i>Brander</i>, 1766.&mdash;Gustavus Brander published, in 1766, his "Fossilia
Hantoniensia," containing excellent figures of fossil shells from the more
modern (or Eocene) marine strata of Hampshire. "Various opinions,"
he says in the preface, "had been entertained concerning the time when
and how these bodies became deposited. Some there are who conceive
that it might have been effected in a wonderful length of time by a
gradual changing and shifting of the sea," &amp;c. But the most common
cause assigned is that of "the deluge." This conjecture, he says, even
if the universality of the flood be not called in question, is purely hypothetical.
In his opinion, fossil animals and testacea were, for the most
part, of unknown species; and of such as were known, the living analogues
now belonged to southern latitudes.</p>

<p><i>Soldani</i>, 1780.&mdash;Soldani applied successfully his knowledge of zoology
to illustrate the history of stratified masses. He explained that microscopic
testacea and zoophytes inhabited the depths of the Mediterranean;
and that the fossil species were, in like manner, found in those deposits
wherein the fineness of their particles, and the absence of pebbles, implied
that they were accumulated in a deep sea, or far from shore. This
author first remarked the alternation of marine and freshwater strata in
the Paris basin.<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p><i>Fortis&mdash;Testa</i>, 1793.&mdash;A lively controversy arose between Fortis and
another Italian naturalist, Testa, concerning the fish of Monte Bolca, in
1793. Their letters,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> written with great spirit and elegance, show that
they were aware that a large proportion of the Subapennine shells were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
identical with living species, and some of them with species now living
in the torrid zone. Fortis proposed a somewhat fanciful conjecture, that
when the volcanoes of the Vicentin were burning, the waters of the Adriatic
had a higher temperature; and in this manner, he said, the shells
of warmer regions may once have peopled their own seas. But Testa
was disposed to think that these species of testacea were still common
to their own and to equinoctial seas; for many, he said, once supposed
to be confined to hotter regions, had been afterwards discovered in the
Mediterranean.<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p><i>Cortesi&mdash;Spallanzani&mdash;Wallerius&mdash;Whitehurst.</i>&mdash;While these Italian
naturalists, together with Cortesi and Spallanzani, were busily engaged
in pointing out the analogy between the deposits of modern and
ancient seas, and the habits and arrangement of their organic inhabitants,
and while some progress was making, in the same country, in
investigating the ancient and modern volcanic rocks, some of the most
original observers among the English and German writers, Whitehurst<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>
and Wallerius, were wasting their strength in contending, according to
the old Woodwardian hypothesis, that all the strata were formed by
Noah's deluge. But Whitehurst's description of the rocks of Derbyshire
was most faithful; and he atoned for false theoretical views, by
providing data for their refutation.</p>

<p><i>Pallas&mdash;Saussure.</i>&mdash;Towards the close of the eighteenth century, the
idea of distinguishing the mineral masses on our globe into separate
groups, and studying their relations, began to be generally diffused.
Pallas and Saussure were among the most celebrated whose labors contributed
to this end. After an attentive examination of the two great
mountain chains of Siberia, Pallas announced the result, that the granitic
rocks were in the middle, the schistose at their sides, and the limestones
again on the outside of these; and this he conceived would
prove a general law in the formation of all chains composed chiefly of
primary rocks.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>In his "Travels in Russia," in 1793 and 1794, he made many geological
observations on the recent strata near the Wolga and the Caspian,
and adduced proofs of the greater extent of the latter sea at no
distant era in the earth's history. His memoir on the fossil bones of
Siberia attracted attention to some of the most remarkable phenomena
in geology. He stated that he had found a rhinoceros entire in the frozen
soil, with its skin and flesh: an elephant, found afterwards in a mass
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
of ice on the shore of the North Sea, removed all doubt as to the accuracy
of so wonderful a discovery.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a></p>

<p>The subjects relating to natural history which engaged the attention
of Pallas, were too multifarious to admit of his devoting a large share
of his labors exclusively to geology. Saussure, on the other hand, employed
the chief portion of his time in studying the structure of the
Alps and Jura, and he provided valuable data for those who followed
him. He did not pretend to deduce any general system from his numerous
and interesting observations; and the few theoretical opinions which
escaped from him, seem, like those of Pallas, to have been chiefly derived
from the cosmological speculations of preceding writers.</p>

<p><i>Werner.</i>&mdash;The art of mining has long been taught in France, Germany,
and Hungary, in scientific institutions established for that purpose,
where mineralogy has always been a principal branch of instruction.</p>

<p>Werner was named, in 1775, professor of that science in the "School
of Mines," at Freyberg, in Saxony. He directed his attention not
merely to the composition and external characters of minerals, but also
to what he termed "geognosy," or the natural position of minerals in
particular rocks, together with the grouping of those rocks, their geographical
distribution, and various relations. The phenomena observed
in the structure of the globe had hitherto served for little else than to
furnish interesting topics for philosophical discussion; but when Werner
pointed out their application to the practical purposes of mining, they
were instantly regarded by a large class of men as an essential part of
their professional education, and from that time the science was cultivated
in Europe more ardently and systematically. Werner's mind was
at once imaginative and richly stored with miscellaneous knowledge.
He associated every thing with his favorite science, and in his excursive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>lectures, he pointed out all the economical uses of minerals, and their
application to medicine; the influence of the mineral composition of
rocks upon the soil, and of the soil upon the resources, wealth, and civilization
of man. The vast sandy plains of Tartary and Africa, he
would say, retained their inhabitants in the shape of wandering shepherds;
the granitic mountains and the low calcareous and alluvial plains
gave rise to different manners, degrees of wealth, and intelligence. The
history even of languages, and the migration of tribes, had been determined
by the direction of particular strata. The qualities of certain stones
used in building would lead him to descant on the architecture of different
ages and nations; and the physical geography of a country frequently
invited him to treat of military tactics. The charm of his manners
and his eloquence kindled enthusiasm in the minds of his pupils; and
many, who had intended at first only to acquire a slight knowledge of
mineralogy, when they had once heard him, devoted themselves to it as
the business of their lives. In a few years, a small school of mines,
before unheard of in Europe, was raised to the rank of a great university;
and men already distinguished in science studied the German
language, and came from the most distant countries to hear the great
oracle of geology.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>Werner had a great antipathy to the mechanical labor of writing, and,
with the exception of a valuable treatise on metalliferous veins, he could
never be persuaded to pen more than a few brief memoirs, and those
containing no development of his general views. Although the natural
modesty of his disposition was excessive, approaching even to timidity,
he indulged in the most bold and sweeping generalizations, and he inspired
all his scholars with a most implicit faith in his doctrines. Their
admiration of his genius, and the feelings of gratitude and friendship
which they all felt for him, were not undeserved; but the supreme authority
usurped by him over the opinions of his contemporaries, was
eventually prejudicial to the progress of the science; so much so, as
greatly to counterbalance the advantages which it derived from his exertions.
If it be true that delivery be the first, second, and third requisite
in a popular orator, it is no less certain, that to travel is of first,
second, and third importance to those who desire to originate just and
comprehensive views concerning the structure of our globe. Now Werner
had not travelled to distant countries; he had merely explored a
small portion of Germany, and conceived, and persuaded others to believe,
that the whole surface of our planet, and all the mountain chains
in the world, were made after the model of his own province. It became
a ruling object of ambition in the minds of his pupils to confirm
the generalizations of their great master, and to discover in the most
distant parts of the globe his "universal formations," which he supposed
had been each in succession simultaneously precipitated over the whole
earth from a common menstruum, or "chaotic fluid." It now appears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>that the Saxon professor had misinterpreted many of the most important
appearances even in the immediate neighborhood of Freyberg. Thus,
for example, within a day's journey of his school, the porphyry, called
by him primitive, has been found not only to send forth veins or dikes
through strata of the coal formation, but to overlie them in mass. The
granite of the Hartz mountains, on the other hand, which he supposed
to be the nucleus of the chain, is now well known to traverse the other
beds, as near Goslar; and still nearer Freyberg, in the Erzgebirge, the
mica slate does not mantle round the granite as was supposed, but abuts
abruptly against it. Fragments, also, of the greywack&eacute; slate, containing
organic remains, have recently been found entangled in the granite of
the Hartz, by M. de Seckendorf.<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>The principal merit of Werner's system of instruction consisted in
steadily directing the attention of his scholars to the constant relations
of superposition of certain mineral groups; but he had been anticipated,
as has been shown in the last chapter, in the discovery of this general
law, by several geologists in Italy and elsewhere; and his leading divisions
of the secondary strata were at the same time, and independently,
made the basis of an arrangement of the British strata by our countryman,
William Smith, to whose work I shall refer in the sequel.</p>

<p><i>Controversy between the Vulcanists and Neptunists.</i>&mdash;In regard to
basalt and other igneous rocks, Werner's theory was original, but it was
also extremely erroneous. The basalts of Saxony and Hesse, to which
his observations were chiefly confined, consisted of tabular masses capping
the hills, and not connected with the levels of existing valleys, like many
in Auvergne and the Vivarais. These basalts, and all other rocks of
the same family in other countries, were, according to him, chemical
precipitates from water. He denied that they were the products of
submarine volcanoes; and even taught that, in the primeval ages of the
world, there were no volcanoes. His theory was opposed, in a twofold
sense, to the doctrine of the permanent agency of the same causes in
nature; for not only did he introduce, without scruple, many imaginary
causes supposed to have once effected great revolutions in the earth, and
then to have become extinct, but new ones also were feigned to have
come into play in modern times; and, above all, that most violent instrument
of change, the agency of subterranean heat.</p>

<p>So early as 1768, before Werner had commenced his mineralogical
studies, Raspe had truly characterized the basalts of Hesse as of igneous
origin. Arduino, we have seen, had pointed out numerous varieties of
trap-rock in the Vicentin as analogous to volcanic products, and as distinctly
referable to ancient submarine eruptions. Desmarest, as before
stated, had, in company with Fortis, examined the Vicentin in 1766, and
confirmed Arduino's views. In 1772, Banks, Solander, and Troil compared
the columnar basalt of Hecla with that of the Hebrides. Collini,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>in 1774, recognized the true nature of the igneous rocks on the Rhine,
between Andernach and Bonn. In 1775, Guettard visited the Vivarais,
and established the relation of basaltic currents to lavas. Lastly, in
1779, Faujas published his description of the volcanoes of the Vivarais
and Velay, and showed how the streams of basalt had poured out from
craters which still remain in a perfect state.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p><i>Desmarest.</i>&mdash;When sound opinions had thus for twenty years prevailed
in Europe concerning the true nature of the ancient trap-rocks,
Werner by his simple dictum caused a retrograde movement, and not
only overturned the true theory, but substituted for it one of the most
unphilosophical that can well be imagined. The continued ascendancy
of his dogmas on this subject was the more astonishing, because a variety
of new and striking facts were daily accumulated in favor of the
correct opinions previously entertained. Desmarest, after a careful
examination of Auvergne, pointed out, first, the most recent volcanoes
which had their craters still entire, and their streams of lava conforming
to the level of the present river-courses. He then showed that there
were others of an intermediate epoch, whose craters were nearly effaced,
and whose lavas were less intimately connected with the present valleys;
and, lastly, that there were volcanic rocks, still more ancient, without
any discernible craters or scori&aelig;, and bearing the closest analogy to
rocks in other parts of Europe, the igneous origin of which was denied
by the school of Freyberg.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>Desmarest's map of Auvergne was a work of uncommon merit. He
first made a trigonometrical survey of the district, and delineated its
physical geography with minute accuracy and admirable graphic power.
He contrived, at the same time, to express without the aid of colors,
many geological details, including the different ages and sometimes even
the structure, of the volcanic rocks, and distinguishing them from the
fresh-water and the granitic. They alone who have carefully studied
Auvergne, and traced the different lava streams from their craters to
their termination,&mdash;the various isolated basaltic cappings,&mdash;the relation
of some lavas to the present valleys,&mdash;-the absence of such relations
in others,&mdash;can appreciate the extraordinary fidelity of this elaborate
work. No other district of equal dimensions in Europe exhibits, perhaps,
so beautiful and varied a series of phenomena; and, fortunately,
Desmarest possessed at once the mathematical knowledge required for
the construction of a map, skill in mineralogy, and a power of original
generalization.</p>

<p><i>Dolomieu&mdash;Montlosier.</i>&mdash;Dolomieu, another of Werner's contemporaries,
had found prismatic basalt among the ancient lavas of Etna; and,
in 1784, had observed the alternations of submarine lavas and calcareous
strata in the Val di Noto, in Sicily.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> In 1790, also, he described similar
phenomena in the Vicentin and in the Tyrol.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> Montlosier published,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>in 1788, an essay on the theories of volcanoes of Auvergne, combining
accurate local observations with comprehensive views. Notwithstanding
this mass of evidence the scholars of Werner were prepared to
support his opinions to their utmost extent; maintaining, in the fulness
of their faith, that even obsidian was an aqueous precipitate. As they
were blinded by their veneration for the great teacher, they were impatient
of opposition, and soon imbibed the spirit of a faction; and their
opponents, the Vulcanists, were not long in becoming contaminated with
the same intemperate zeal. Ridicule and irony were weapons more
frequently employed than argument by the rival sects, till at last the
controversy was carried on with a degree of bitterness almost unprecedented
in questions of physical science. Desmarest alone, who had
long before provided ample materials for refuting such a theory, kept
aloof from the strife; and whenever a zealous Neptunist wished to draw
the old man into an argument, he was satisfied with replying, "Go and
see."<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<p><i>Hutton</i>, 1788.&mdash;It would be contrary to all analogy, in matters of
graver import, that a war should rage with such fury on the Continent,
and that the inhabitants of our island should not mingle in the affray.
Although in England the personal influence of Werner was wanting to
stimulate men to the defence of the weaker side of the question, they
contrived to find good reason for espousing the Wernerian errors with
great enthusiasm. In order to explain the peculiar motives which led
many to enter, even with party feeling, into this contest, it will be necessary
to present the reader with a sketch of the views unfolded by
Hutton, a contemporary of the Saxon geologist. The former naturalist
had been educated as a physician, but declining the practice of medicine,
he resolved, when young, to remain content with the small independence
inherited from his father, and thenceforth to give his undivided
attention to scientific pursuits. He resided at Edinburgh, where
he enjoyed the society of many men of high attainments, who loved
him for the simplicity of his manners, and the sincerity of his character.
His application was unwearied; and he made frequent tours through
different parts of England and Scotland, acquiring considerable skill as
a mineralogist, and consequently arriving at grand and comprehensive
views in geology. He communicated the results of his observations
unreservedly, and with the fearless spirit of one who was conscious
that love of truth was the sole stimulus of his exertions. When at
length he had matured his views, he published, in 1788, his "Theory
of the Earth,"<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> and the same, afterwards more fully developed in a
separate work, in 1795. This treatise was the first in which geology
was declared to be in no way concerned about "questions as to the origin
of things;" the first in which an attempt was made to dispense entirely
with all hypothetical causes, and to explain the former changes
of the earth's crust by reference exclusively to natural agents. Hutton
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>labored to give fixed principles to geology, as Newton had succeeded
in doing to astronomy; but, in the former science, too little progress
had been made towards furnishing the necessary data, to enable any
philosopher, however great his genius, to realize so noble a project.</p>

<p><i>Huttonian theory.</i>&mdash;"The ruins of an older world," said Hutton,
"are visible in the present structure of our planet; and the strata
which now compose our continents have been once beneath the sea, and
were formed out of the waste of pre-existing continents. The same
forces are still destroying, by chemical decomposition or mechanical
violence, even the hardest rocks, and transporting the materials to the
sea, where they are spread out, and form strata analogous to those of
more ancient date. Although loosely deposited along the bottom of the
ocean, they become afterwards altered and consolidated by volcanic
heat, and then heaved up, fractured, and contorted."</p>

<p>Although Hutton had never explored any region of active volcanoes,
he had convinced himself that basalt and many other trap-rocks were of
igneous origin, and that many of them had been injected in a melted state
through fissures in the older strata. The compactness of these rocks,
and their different aspect from that of ordinary lava, he attributed to
their having cooled down under the pressure of the sea; and in order to
remove the objections started against this theory, his friend, Sir James
Hall, instituted a most curious and instructive series of chemical experiments,
illustrating the crystalline arrangement and texture assumed by
melted matter cooled under high pressure.</p>

<p>The absence of stratification in granite, and its analogy, in mineral
character, to rocks which he deemed of igneous origin, led Hutton to conclude
that granite also must have been formed from matter in fusion;
and this inference he felt could not be fully confirmed, unless he discovered
at the contact of granite and other strata a repetition of the
phenomena exhibited so constantly by the trap-rocks. Resolved to try
his theory by this test, he went to the Grampians, and surveyed the line
of junction of the granite and superincumbent stratified masses, until he
found in Glen Tilt, in 1785, the most clear and unequivocal proofs in
support of his views. Veins of red granite are there seen branching out
from the principal mass, and traversing the black micaceous schist and
primary limestone. The intersected stratified rocks are so distinct in
color and appearance as to render the example in that locality most
striking, and the alteration of the limestone in contact was very analogous
to that produced by trap veins on calcareous strata. This verification of
his system filled him with delight, and called forth such marks of joy
and exultation, that the guides who accompanied him, says his biographer,
were convinced that he must have discovered a vein of silver or
gold.<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> He was aware that the same theory would not explain the origin
of the primary schists, but these he called primary, rejecting the term
primitive, and was disposed to consider them as sedimentary rocks
al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>tered by heat, and that they originated in some other form from the waste
of previously existing rocks.</p>

<p>By this important discovery of granite veins, to which he had been
led by fair induction from an independent class of facts, Hutton prepared
the way for the greatest innovation of the systems of his predecessors.
Vallisneri had pointed out the general fact that there were certain fundamental
rocks which contained no organic remains, and which he supposed
to have been formed before the creation of living beings. Moro, Generelli,
and other Italian writers, embraced the same doctrine; and Lehman regarded
the mountains called by him primitive, as parts of the original
nucleus of the globe. The same tenet was an article of faith in the
school of Freyberg; and if any one ventured to doubt the possibility of
our being enabled to carry back our researches to the creation of the
present order of things, the granitic rocks were triumphantly appealed
to. On them seemed written, in legible characters, the memorable inscription&mdash;</p>

<p>
"Dinanzi a me non fur cose create
Se non eterne;"<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>
</p>

<p>and no small sensation was excited when Hutton seemed, with unhallowed
hand, desirous to erase characters already regarded by many as
sacred. "In the economy of the world," said the Scotch geologist, "I
can find no traces of a beginning, no prospect of an end;" a declaration
the more startling when coupled with the doctrine, that all past ages
on the globe had been brought about by the slow agency of existing
causes. The imagination was first fatigued and overpowered by endeavoring
to conceive the immensity of time required for the annihilation
of whole continents by so insensible a process; and when the thoughts
had wandered through these interminable periods, no resting-place was
assigned in the remotest distance. The oldest rocks were represented
to be of a derivative nature, the last of an antecedent series, and that,
perhaps, one of many pre-existing worlds. Such views of the immensity
of past time, like those unfolded by the Newtonian philosophy in regard
to space, were too vast to awaken ideas of sublimity unmixed with
a painful sense of our incapacity to conceive a plan of such infinite extent.
Worlds are seen beyond worlds immeasurably distant from each
other, and, beyond them all, innumerable other systems are faintly traced
on the confines of the visible universe.</p>

<p>The characteristic feature of the Huttonian theory was, as before
hinted, the exclusion of all causes not supposed to belong to the present
order of nature. But Hutton had made no step beyond Hooke, Moro,
and Raspe, in pointing out in what manner the laws now governing subterranean
movements might bring about geological changes, if sufficient
time be allowed. On the contrary, he seems to have fallen far short of
some of their views, especially when he refused to attribute any part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>of the external configuration of the earth's crust to subsidence. He
imagined that the continents were first gradually destroyed by aqueous
degradation; and when their ruins had furnished materials for new
continents, they were upheaved by violent convulsions. He therefore
required alternate periods of general disturbance and repose; and such
he believed had been, and would forever be, the course of nature.</p>

<p>Generelli, in his exposition of Moro's system, had made a far nearer
approximation towards reconciling geological appearances with the state
of nature as known to us; for while he agreed with Hutton, that the
decay and reproduction of rocks were always in progress, proceeding
with the utmost uniformity, the learned Carmelite represented the repairs
of mountains by elevation from below to be effected by an equally
constant and synchronous operation. Neither of these theories, considered
singly, satisfies all the conditions of the great problem, which a
geologist, who rejects cosmological causes, is called upon to solve; but
they probably contain together the germs of a perfect system. There
can be no doubt, that periods of disturbance and repose have followed
each other in succession in every region of the globe; but it may be
equally true, that the energy of the subterranean movements has been
always uniform as regards the <i>whole earth</i>. The force of earthquakes
may for a cycle of years have been invariably confined, as it is now, to
large but determinate spaces, and may then have gradually shifted its
position, so that another region, which had for ages been at rest, became
in its turn the grand theatre of action.</p>

<p><i>Playfair's illustrations of Hutton.</i>&mdash;The explanation proposed by
Hutton, and by Playfair, the illustrator of his theory, respecting the
origin of valleys and of alluvial accumulations, was also very imperfect.
They ascribed none of the inequalities of the earth's surface to movements
which accompanied the upheaving of the land, imagining that
valleys in general were formed in the course of ages by the rivers now
flowing in them; while they seem not to have reflected on the excavating
and transporting power which the waves of the ocean might exert
on land during its emergence.</p>

<p>Although Hutton's knowledge of mineralogy and chemistry was considerable,
he possessed but little information concerning organic remains;
they merely served him, as they did Werner, to characterize certain
strata, and to prove their marine origin. The theory of former revolutions
in organic life was not yet fully recognized; and without this class
of proofs in support of the antiquity of the globe, the indefinite periods
demanded by the Huttonian hypothesis appeared visionary to many;
and some, who deemed the doctrine inconsistent with revealed truths,
indulged very uncharitable suspicions of the motives of its author.
They accused him of a deliberate design of reviving the heathen dogma
of an "eternal succession," and of denying that this world ever had a
beginning. Playfair, in the biography of his friend, has the following
comment on this part of their theory:&mdash;"In the planetary motions,
where geometry has carried the eye so far, both into the future and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
past, we discover no mark either of the commencement or termination
of the present order. It is unreasonable, indeed, to suppose that such
marks should anywhere exist. The Author of Nature has not given
laws to the universe, which, like the institutions of men, carry in themselves
the elements of their own destruction. He has not permitted in
His works any symptom of infancy or of old age, or any sign by which
we may estimate either their future or their past duration. <i>He may
put an end, as he no doubt gave a beginning</i>, to the present system, at
some determinate period of time; but we may rest assured that this
great catastrophe will not be brought about by the laws now existing,
and that it is not indicated, by any thing which we perceive."<a name="FNanchor_107" id="FNanchor_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p>The party feeling excited against the Huttonian doctrines, and the
open disregard of candor and temper in the controversy, will hardly be
credited by the reader, unless he recalls to his recollection that the mind of
the English public was at that time in a state of feverish excitement.
A class of writers in France had been laboring industriously for many
years, to diminish the influence of the clergy, by sapping the foundations
of the Christian faith; and their success, and the consequences of
the Revolution, had alarmed the most resolute minds, while the imagination
of the more timid was continually haunted by dread of innovation,
as by the phantom of some fearful dream.</p>

<p><i>Voltaire.</i>&mdash;Voltaire had used the modern discoveries in physics as
one of the numerous weapons of attack and ridicule directed by him
against the Scriptures. He found that the most popular systems of
geology were accommodated to the sacred writings, and that much ingenuity
had been employed to make every fact coincide exactly with
the Mosaic account of the creation and deluge. It was, therefore, with no
friendly feelings that he contemplated the cultivators of geology in general,
regarding the science as one which had been successfully enlisted
by theologians as an ally in their cause.<a name="FNanchor_108" id="FNanchor_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> He knew that the majority
of those who were aware of the abundance of fossil shells in the interior
of continents, were still persuaded that they were proofs of the universal
deluge; and as the readiest way of shaking this article of faith, he
endeavored to inculcate skepticism as to the real nature of such shells,
and to recall from contempt the exploded dogma of the sixteenth century,
that they were sports of nature. He also pretended that vegetable
impressions were not those of real plants.<a name="FNanchor_109" id="FNanchor_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> Yet he was perfectly
convinced that the shells had really belonged to living testacea, as may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>be seen in his essay "On the formation of Mountains."<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> He would
sometimes, in defiance of all consistency, shift his ground when addressing
the vulgar; and, admitting the true nature of the shells collected in
the Alps and other places, pretend that they were Eastern species,
which had fallen from the hats of pilgrims coming from Syria. The
numerous essays written by him on geological subjects were all calculated
to strengthen prejudices, partly because he was ignorant of the
real state of the science, and partly from his bad faith.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> On the other
hand, they who knew that his attacks were directed by a desire to invalidate
Scripture, and who were unacquainted with the true merits of
the question, might well deem the old diluvian hypothesis incontrovertible,
if Voltaire could adduce no better argument against it than to deny
the true nature of organic remains.</p>

<p>It is only by careful attention to impediments originating in extrinsic
causes, that we can explain the slow and reluctant adoption of the simplest
truths in geology. First, we find many able naturalists adducing
the fossil remains of marine animals as proofs of an event related in
Scripture. The evidence is deemed conclusive by the multitude for a
century or more; for it favors opinions which they entertained before,
and they are gratified by supposing them confirmed by fresh and unexpected
proofs. Many who see through the fallacy have no wish to undeceive
those who are influenced by it, approving the effect of the delusion,
and conniving at it as a pious fraud; until, finally, an opposite party,
who are hostile to the sacred writings, labor to explode the erroneous
opinion, by substituting for it another dogma, which they know to be
equally unsound.</p>

<p>The heretical Vulcanists were soon after openly assailed in England,
by imputations of the most illiberal kind. We cannot estimate the malevolence
of such a persecution, by the pain which similar insinuations
might now inflict; for although charges of infidelity and atheism must
always be odious, they were injurious in the extreme at that moment of
political excitement; and it was better, perhaps, for a man's good reception
in society, that his moral character should have been traduced, than
that he should become a mark for these poisoned weapons.</p>

<p>I shall pass over the works of numerous divines, who may be excused
for sensitiveness on points which then excited so much uneasiness in the
public mind; and shall say nothing of the amiable poet Cowper,<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>could hardly be expected to have inquired into the merit of doctrines in
physics. But in the foremost ranks of the intolerant are found several
laymen who had high claims to scientific reputation. Among these appears
Williams, a mineral surveyor of Edinburgh, who published a
"Natural History of the Mineral Kingdom," in 1789; a work of great
merit, for that day, and of practical utility, as containing the best account
of the coal strata. In his preface he misrepresents Hutton's theory
altogether, and charges him with considering all rocks to be lavas
of different colors and structure; and also with "warping every thing to
support the eternity of the world."<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> He descants on the pernicious
influence of such skeptical notions, as leading to downright infidelity
and atheism, "and as being nothing less than to depose the Almighty
Creator of the universe from his office."<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p><i>Kirwan</i>&mdash;<i>De Luc.</i>&mdash;Kirwan, president of the Royal Academy of
Dublin, a chemist and mineralogist of some merit, but who possessed
much greater authority in the scientific world than he was entitled by
his talents to enjoy, said, in the introduction to his "Geological Essays,
1799," "that <i>sound</i> geology <i>graduated</i> into religion, and was required
to dispel certain systems of atheism or infidelity, of which they had had
recent experience."<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> He was an uncompromising defender of the aqueous
theory of all rocks, and was scarcely surpassed by Burnet and
Whiston, in his desire to adduce the Mosaic writings in confirmation of
his opinions.</p>

<p>De Luc, in the preliminary discourse to his Treatise on Geology,<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>
says, "The weapons have been changed by which revealed religion is
attacked; it is now assailed by geology, and the knowledge of this
science has become essential to theologians." He imputes the failure
of former geological systems to their having been anti-Mosaical, and
directed against a "sublime tradition." These and similar imputations,
reiterated in the works of De Luc, seem to have been taken for granted
by some modern writers: it is therefore necessary to state, in justice to
the numerous geologists of different nations, whose works have been
considered, that none of them were guilty of endeavoring, by arguments
drawn from physics, to invalidate scriptural tenets. On the contrary,
the majority of those who were fortunate enough "to discover the true
causes of things," rarely deserved another part of the poet's panegyric,
"<i>Atque metus omnes subjecit pedibus</i>." The caution and even timid reserve,
of many eminent Italian authors of the earlier period is very apparent;
and there can hardly be a doubt, that they subscribed to certain
dogmas, and particularly to the first diluvian theory, out of deference
to popular prejudices, rather than from conviction. If they were
guilty of dissimulation, we may feel regret, but must not blame their
want of moral courage, reserving rather our condemnation for the intol<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>erance
of the times, and that inquisitorial power which forced Galileo to
abjure, and the two Jesuits to disclaim the theory of Newton.<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>Hutton answered Kirwan's attacks with great warmth, and with the
indignation justly excited by unmerited reproach. "He had always
displayed," says Playfair, "the utmost disposition to admire the beneficent
design manifested in the structure of the world; and he contemplated
with delight those parts of his theory which made the greatest
additions to our knowledge of final causes." We may say with equal
truth, that in no scientific works in our language can more eloquent
passages be found, concerning the fitness, harmony, and grandeur of all
parts of the creation, than in those of Playfair. They are evidently the
unaffected expressions of a mind, which contemplated the study of
nature, as best calculated to elevate our conceptions of the attributes of
the First Cause. At any other time the force and elegance of Playfair's
style must have insured popularity to the Huttonian doctrines;
but by a singular coincidence, Neptunianism and orthodoxy were now
associated in the same creed; and the tide of prejudice ran so strong,
that the majority were carried far away into the chaotic fluid, and other
cosmological inventions of Werner. These fictions the Saxon professor
had borrowed with little modification, and without any improvement,
from his predecessors. They had not the smallest foundation either in
Scripture or in common sense, and were probably approved of by many
as being so ideal and unsubstantial, that they could never come into
violent collision with any preconceived opinions.</p>

<p>According to De Luc, the first essential distinction to be made between
the various phenomena exhibited on the surface of the earth was,
to determine which were the results of causes still in action, and which
had been produced by causes that had ceased to act. The form and
composition of the mass of our continents, he said, and their existence
above the level of the sea, must be ascribed to causes no longer in
action. These continents emerged, at no very remote period, on the
sudden retreat of the ocean, the waters of which made their way into
subterranean caverns. The formation of the rocks which enter into the
crust of the earth began with the precipitation of granite from a primordial
liquid, after which other strata containing the remains of or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>ganized
bodies were deposited, till at last the present sea remained as
the residuum of the primordial liquid, and no longer continued to produce
mineral strata.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p><i>William Smith</i>, 1790.&mdash;While the tenets of the rival schools of
Freyberg and Edinburgh were warmly espoused by devoted partisans,
the labors of an individual, unassisted by the advantages of wealth or
station in society, were almost unheeded. Mr. William Smith, an English
surveyor, published his "Tabular View of the British Strata" in
1790, wherein he proposed a classification of the secondary formations
in the West of England. Although he had not communicated with
Werner, it appeared by this work that he had arrived at the same views
respecting the laws of superposition of stratified rocks; that he was
aware that the order of succession of different groups was never inverted;
and that they might be identified at very distant points by their
peculiar organized fossils.</p>

<p>From the time of the appearance of the "Tabular View," the author
labored to construct a geological map of the whole of England; and
with the greatest disinterestedness of mind, communicated the results of
his investigations to all who desired information, giving such publicity
to his original views, as to enable his contemporaries almost to compete
with him in the race. The execution of his map was completed in
1815, and remains a lasting monument of original talent and extraordinary
perseverance; for he had explored the whole country on foot,
without the guidance of previous observers, or the aid of fellow-laborers,
and had succeeded in throwing into natural divisions the whole complicated
series of British rocks. D'Aubuisson, a distinguished pupil of
Werner, paid a just tribute of praise to this remarkable performance,
observing, that "what many celebrated mineralogists had only accomplished
for a small part of Germany in the course of half a century, had
been effected by a single individual for the whole of England."<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p>Werner invented a new language to express his divisions of rocks,
and some of his technical terms, such as grauwacke, gneiss, and others,
passed current in every country in Europe. Smith adopted for the most
part English provincial terms, often of barbarous sound, such as gault,
cornbrash, clunch clay; and affixed them to subdivisions of the British
series. Many of these still retain their place in our scientific classifications,
and attest his priority of arrangement.</p>

<p>MODERN PROGRESS OF GEOLOGY.</p>

<p>The contention of the rival factions of the Vulcanists and Neptunists
had been carried to such a height, that these names had become terms
of reproach; and the two parties had been less occupied in searching
for truth, than for such arguments as might strengthen their own cause
or serve to annoy their antagonists. A new school at last arose, who
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>professed the strictest neutrality, and the utmost indifference to the
systems of Werner and Hutton, and who resolved diligently to devote
their labors to observation. The reaction, provoked by the intemperance
of the conflicting parties, now produced a tendency to extreme
caution. Speculative views were discountenanced, and, through fear of
exposing themselves to the suspicion of a bias towards the dogmas of a
party, some geologists became anxious to entertain no opinion whatever
on the causes of phenomena, and were inclined to skepticism even where
the conclusions deducible from observed facts scarcely admitted of reasonable
doubt.</p>

<p><i>Geological Society of London.</i>&mdash;But although the reluctance to theorize
was carried somewhat to excess, no measure could be more salutary
at such a moment than a suspension of all attempts to form what were
termed "theories of the earth." A great body of new data were required;
and the Geological Society of London, founded in 1807, conduced
greatly to the attainment of this desirable end. To multiply and
record observations, and patiently to await the result at some future
period, was the object proposed by them; and it was their favorite
maxim that the time was not yet come for a general system of geology,
but that all must be content for many years to be exclusively engaged
in furnishing materials for future generalizations. By acting up to these
principles with consistency, they in a few years disarmed all prejudice,
and rescued the science from the imputation of being a dangerous, or at
best but a visionary pursuit.</p>

<p>A distinguished modern writer has with truth remarked, that the advancement
of three of the main divisions of geological inquiry have during
the last half century been promoted successively by three different nations
of Europe,&mdash;the Germans, the English, and the French.<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> We have seen
that the systematic study of what may be called mineralogical geology
had its origin and chief point of activity in Germany, where Werner first
described with precision the mineral characters of rocks. The classification
of the secondary formations, each marked by their peculiar fossils,
belongs, in a great measure, to England, where the labors before alluded
to of Smith, and those of the most active members of the Geological
Society of London, were steadily directed to these objects. The foundation
of the third branch, that relating to the tertiary formations, was laid
in France by the splendid work of Cuvier and Brongniart, published in
1808, "On the Mineral Geography and Organic Remains of the Neighborhood
of Paris."</p>

<p>We may still trace, in the language of the science and our present
methods of arrangement, the various countries where the growth of these
several departments of geology was at different times promoted. Many
names of simple minerals and rocks remain to this day German; while
the European divisions of the secondary strata are in great part English,
and are, indeed, often founded too exclusively on English types. Lastly,
the subdivisions first established of the succession of strata in the Paris
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>basin have served as normal groups to which other tertiary deposits
throughout Europe have been compared, even in cases where this
standard was wholly inapplicable.</p>

<p>No period could have been more fortunate for the discovery, in the
immediate neighborhood of Paris, of a rich store of well-preserved fossils,
than the commencement of the present century; for at no former
era had Natural history been cultivated with such enthusiasm in the
French metropolis. The labors of Cuvier in comparative osteology, and
of Lamarck in recent and fossil shells, had raised these departments of
study to a rank of which they had never previously been deemed susceptible.
Their investigations had eventually a powerful effect in dispelling
the illusion which had long prevailed concerning the absence of
analogy between the ancient and modern state of our planet. A close
comparison of the recent and fossil species and the inferences drawn in
regard to their habits, accustomed the geologist to contemplate the
earth as having been at successive periods the dwelling-place of animals
and plants of different races, some terrestrial, and others aquatic&mdash;some
fitted to live in seas, others in the waters of lakes and rivers. By the
consideration of these topics, the mind was slowly and insensibly withdrawn
from imaginary pictures of catastrophes and chaotic confusion,
such as haunted the imagination of the early cosmogonists. Numerous
proofs were discovered of the tranquil deposition of sedimentary matter,
and the slow development of organic life. If many writers, and Cuvier
himself in the number, still continued to maintain, that "the thread of
induction was broken,"<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> yet, in reasoning by the strict rules of induction
from recent to fossil species, they in a great measure disclaimed
the dogma which in theory they professed. The adoption of the same
generic, and, in some cases, even of the same specific, names for the
exuvi&aelig; of fossil animals and their living analogues, was an important step
towards familiarizing the mind with the idea of the identity and unity of
the system in distant eras. It was an acknowledgment, as it were, that
part at least of the ancient memorials of nature were written in a living
language. The growing importance, then, of the natural history of organic
remains may be pointed out as the characteristic feature of the
progress of the science during the present century. This branch of
knowledge has already become an instrument of great utility in geological
classification, and is continuing daily to unfold new data for grand and
enlarged views respecting the former changes of the earth.</p>

<p>When we compare the result of observations in the last fifty years
with those of the three preceding centuries, we cannot but look forward
with the most sanguine expectations to the degree of excellence to which
geology may be carried, even by the labors of the present generation.
Never, perhaps, did any science, with the exception of astronomy, unfold,
in an equally brief period, so many novel and unexpected truths,
and overturn so many preconceived opinions. The senses had for ages
declared the earth to be at rest, until the astronomer taught that it was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>carried through space with inconceivable rapidity. In like manner was
the surface of this planet regarded as having remained unaltered since
its creation, until the geologist proved that it had been the theatre of
reiterated change, and was still the subject of slow but never-ending
fluctuations. The discovery of other systems in the boundless regions
of space was the triumph of astronomy; to trace the same system
through various transformations&mdash;to behold it at successive eras adorned
with different hills and valleys, lakes and seas, and peopled with new inhabitants,
was the delightful meed of geological research. By the
geometer were measured the regions of space, and the relative distances
of the heavenly bodies;&mdash;by the geologist myriads of ages were
reckoned, not by arithmetical computation, but by a train of physical
events&mdash;a succession of phenomena in the animate and inanimate worlds&mdash;signs
which convey to our minds more definite ideas than figures can
do of the immensity of time.</p>

<p>Whether our investigation of the earth's history and structure will
eventually be productive of as great practical benefits to mankind as a
knowledge of the distant heavens, must remain for the decision of posterity.
It was not till astronomy had been enriched by the observations
of many centuries, and had made its way against popular prejudices to
the establishment of a sound theory, that its application to the useful
arts was most conspicuous. The cultivation of geology began at a later
period; and in every step which it has hitherto made towards sound
theoretical principles, it had to contend against more violent prepossessions.
The practical advantages already derived from it have not been
inconsiderable; but our generalizations are yet imperfect, and they
who come after us may be expected to reap the most valuable fruits of
our labor. Meanwhile, the charm of first discovery is our own; and, as
we explore this magnificent field of inquiry, the sentiment of a great
historian of our times may continually be present to our minds, that "he
who calls what has vanished back again into being, enjoys a bliss like
that of creating."<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a></p>

<h4>CHAPTER V</h4>

<h6>PREJUDICES WHICH HAVE RETARDED THE PROGRESS OF GEOLOGY</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Prepossessions in regard to the duration of past time&mdash;Prejudices arising from our
peculiar position as inhabitants of the land&mdash;Of those occasioned by our not
seeing subterranean changes now in progress&mdash;All these causes combine to make
the former course of Nature appear different from the present&mdash;Objections to
the doctrine, that causes similar in kind and energy to those now acting, have
produced the former changes of the earth's surface, considered.</p></div>

<p>If we reflect on the history of the progress of geology, as explained
in the preceding chapters, we perceive that there have been great fluctuations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
of opinion respecting the nature of the causes to which all
former changes of the earth's surface are referable. The first observers
conceived the monuments which the geologist endeavors to decipher
to relate to an original state of the earth, or to a period when there
were causes in activity, distinct, in kind and degree, from those now
constituting the economy of nature. These views were gradually modified,
and some of them entirely abandoned, in proportion as observations
were multiplied, and the signs of former mutations more skilfully
interpreted. Many appearances, which had for a long time been regarded
as indicating mysterious and extraordinary agency, were finally
recognized as the necessary result of the laws now governing the material
world; and the discovery of this unlooked-for conformity has at
length induced some philosophers to infer, that, during the ages contemplated
in geology, there has never been any interruption to the agency
of the same uniform laws of change. The same assemblage of general
causes, they conceive, may have been sufficient to produce, by their
various combinations, the endless diversity of effects, of which the shell
of the earth has preserved the memorials; and, consistently with these
principles, the recurrence of analogous changes is expected by them in
time to come.</p>

<p>Whether we coincide or not in this doctrine, we must admit that the
gradual progress of opinion concerning the succession of phenomena in
very remote eras, resembles, in a singular manner, that which has accompanied
the growing intelligence of every people, in regard to the
economy of nature in their own times. In an early state of advancement,
when a great number of natural appearances are unintelligible,
an eclipse, an earthquake, a flood, or the approach of a comet, with
many other occurrences afterwards found to belong to the regular
course of events, are regarded as prodigies. The same delusion prevails
as to moral phenomena, and many of these are ascribed to the
intervention of demons, ghosts, witches, and other immaterial and
supernatural agents. By degrees, many of the enigmas of the moral
and physical world are explained, and, instead of being due to extrinsic
and irregular causes, they are found to depend on fixed and invariable
laws. The philosopher at last becomes convinced of the undeviating
uniformity of secondary causes; and, guided by his faith in this principle,
he determines the probability of accounts transmitted to him
of former occurrences, and often rejects the fabulous tales of former times,
on the ground of their being irreconcilable with the experience of more
enlightened ages.</p>

<p><i>Prepossessions in regard to the duration of past time.</i>&mdash;As a belief in
the want of conformity in the causes by which the earth's crust has
been modified in ancient and modern periods was, for a long time, universally
prevalent, and that, too, amongst men who were convinced that
the order of nature had been uniform for the last several thousand
years, every circumstance which could have influenced their minds and
given an undue bias to their opinions deserves particular attention.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
Now the reader may easily satisfy himself, that, however undeviating
the course of nature may have been from the earliest epochs, it was
impossible for the first cultivators of geology to come to such a conclusion,
so long as they were under a delusion as to the age of the world,
and the date of the first creation of animate beings. However fantastical
some theories of the sixteenth century may now appear to us,&mdash;however
unworthy of men of great talent and sound judgment,&mdash;we
may rest assured that, if the same misconception now prevailed in regard
to the memorials of human transactions, it would give rise to a
similar train of absurdities. Let us imagine, for example, that Champollion,
and the French and Tuscan literati lately engaged in exploring the
antiquities of Egypt, had visited that country with a firm belief that the
banks of the Nile were never peopled by the human race before the beginning
of the nineteenth century, and that their faith in this dogma was
as difficult to shake as the opinion of our ancestors that the earth was
never the abode of living beings until the creation of the present continents,
and of the species now existing,&mdash;it is easy to perceive what
extravagant systems they would frame, while under the influence of this
delusion, to account for the monuments discovered in Egypt. The
sight of the pyramids, obelisks, colossal statues, and ruined temples,
would fill them with such astonishment, that for a time they would be
as men spell-bound&mdash;wholly incapable of reasoning with sobriety. They
might incline at first to refer the construction of such stupendous
works to some superhuman powers of a primeval world. A system
might be invented resembling that so gravely advanced by Manetho,
who relates that a dynasty of gods originally ruled in Egypt, of whom
Vulcan, the first monarch, reigned nine thousand years; after whom
came Hercules and other demigods, who were at last succeeded by
human kings.</p>

<p>When some fanciful speculations of this kind had amused their imaginations
for a time, some vast repository of mummies would be discovered,
and would immediately undeceive those antiquaries who enjoyed
an opportunity of personally examining them; but the prejudices
of others at a distance, who were not eye-witnesses of the whole phenomena,
would not be so easily overcome. The concurrent report of
many travellers would, indeed, render it necessary for them to accommodate
ancient theories to some of the new facts, and much wit and
ingenuity would be required to modify and defend their old positions.
Each new invention would violate a greater number of known analogies;
for if a theory be required to embrace some false principle, it becomes
more visionary in proportion as facts are multiplied, as would be the
case if geometers were now required to form an astronomical system on
the assumption of the immobility of the earth.</p>

<p>Amongst other fanciful conjectures concerning the history of Egypt,
we may suppose some of the following to be started. "As the banks
of the Nile have been so recently colonized for the first time, the curious
substances called mummies could never in reality have belonged to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
men. They may have been generated by some <i>plastic virtue</i> residing
in the interior of the earth, or they may be abortions of Nature produced
by her incipient efforts in the work of creation. For if deformed
beings are sometimes born even now, when the scheme of the universe
is fully developed, many more may have been 'sent before their time,
scarce half made up,' when the planet itself was in the embryo state.
But if these notions appear to derogate from the perfection of the
Divine attributes, and if these mummies be in all their parts true representations
of the human form, may we not refer them to the future
rather than the past?&mdash;May we not be looking into the womb of Nature,
and not her grave? May not these images be like the shades of the
unborn in Virgil's Elysium&mdash;the archetypes of men not yet called into
existence?"</p>

<p>These speculations, if advocated by eloquent writers, would not fail
to attract many zealous votaries, for they would relieve men from the
painful necessity of renouncing preconceived opinions. Incredible as
such skepticism may appear, it has been rivalled by many systems of
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and among others by that of
the learned Falloppio, who regarded the tusks of fossil elephants as
earthy concretions, and the pottery or fragments of vases in the Monte
Testaceo, near Rome, as works of nature, and not of art. But when
one generation had passed away, and another, not compromised to the
support of antiquated dogmas, had succeeded, they would review the
evidence afforded by mummies more impartially, and would no longer
controvert the preliminary question, that human beings had lived in
Egypt before the nineteenth century: so that when a hundred years perhaps
had been lost, the industry and talents of the philosopher would
be at last directed to the elucidation of points of real historical importance.</p>

<p>But the above arguments are aimed against one only of many prejudices
with which the earlier geologists had to contend. Even when
they conceded that the earth had been peopled with animate beings at
an earlier period than was at first supposed, they had no conception that
the quantity of time bore so great a proportion to the historical era as
is now generally conceded. How fatal every error as to the quantity of
time must prove to the introduction of rational views concerning the
state of things in former ages, may be conceived by supposing the annals
of the civil and military transactions of a great nation to be perused
under the impression that they occurred in a period of one hundred instead
of two thousand years. Such a portion of history would immediately
assume the air of a romance; the events would seem devoid of
credibility, and inconsistent with the present course of human affairs.
A crowd of incidents would follow each other in thick succession. Armies
and fleets would appear to be assembled only to be destroyed, and
cities built merely to fall in ruins. There would be the most violent
transitions from foreign or intestine war to periods of profound peace,
and the works effected during the years of disorder or tranquillity would
appear alike superhuman in magnitude.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span></p>

<p>He who should study the monuments of the natural world under the
influence of a similar infatuation, must draw a no less exaggerated picture
of the energy and violence of causes, and must experience the
same insurmountable difficulty in reconciling the former and present
state of nature. If we could behold in one view all the volcanic cones
thrown up in Iceland, Italy, Sicily, and other parts of Europe, during
the last five thousand years, and could see the lavas which have flowed
during the same period; the dislocations, subsidences, and elevations
caused during earthquakes; the lands added to various deltas, or devoured
by the sea, together with the effects of devastation by floods,
and imagine that all these events had happened in one year, we must
form most exalted ideas of the activity of the agents, and the suddenness
of the revolutions. Were an equal amount of change to pass before
our eyes in the next year, could we avoid the conclusion that some
great crisis of nature was at hand? If geologists, therefore, have misinterpreted
the signs of a succession of events, so as to conclude that
centuries were implied where the characters imported thousands of
years, and thousands of years where the language of Nature signified
millions, they could not, if they reasoned logically from such false premises,
come to any other conclusion than that the system of the natural
world had undergone a complete revolution.</p>

<p>We should be warranted in ascribing the erection of the great pyramid
to superhuman power, if we were convinced that it was raised in
one day; and if we imagine, in the same manner, a continent or mountain-chain
to have been elevated during an equally small fraction of the
time which was really occupied in upheaving it, we might then be
justified in inferring, that the subterranean movements were once far
more energetic than in our own times. We know that during one
earthquake the coast of Chili may be raised for a hundred miles to the
average height of about three feet. A repetition of two thousand
shocks, of equal violence, might produce a mountain-chain one hundred
miles long, and six thousand feet high. Now, should one or two
only of these convulsions happen in a century, it would be consistent
with the order of events experienced by the Chilians from the earliest
times; but if the whole of them were to occur in the next hundred
years, the entire district must be depopulated, scarcely any animals or
plants could survive, and the surface would be one confused heap of
ruin and desolation.</p>

<p>One consequence of undervaluing greatly the quantity of past time,
is the apparent coincidence which it occasions of events necessarily disconnected,
or which are so unusual, that it would be inconsistent with
all calculation of chances to suppose them to happen at one and the
same time. When the unlooked-for association of such rare phenomena
is witnessed in the present course of nature, it scarcely ever fails to
excite a suspicion of the preternatural in those minds which are not
firmly convinced of the uniform agency of secondary causes;&mdash;as if the
death of some individual in whose fate they are interested happens to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
be accompanied by the appearance of a luminous meteor, or a comet, or
the shock of an earthquake. It would be only necessary to multiply
such coincidences indefinitely, and the mind of every philosopher would
be disturbed. Now it would be difficult to exaggerate the number of
physical events, many of them most rare and unconnected in their nature,
which were imagined by the Woodwardian hypothesis to have
happened in the course of a few months; and numerous other examples
might be found of popular geological theories, which require us to imagine
that a long succession of events happened in a brief and almost
momentary period.</p>

<p>Another liability to error, very nearly allied to the former, arises from
the frequent contact of geological monuments referring to very distant
periods of time. We often behold, at one glance, the effects of causes
which have acted at times incalculably remote, and yet there may be no
striking circumstances to mark the occurrence of a great chasm in the
chronological series of Nature's archives. In the vast interval of time
which may really have elapsed between the results of operations thus
compared, the physical condition of the earth may, by slow and insensible
modifications, have become entirely altered; one or more races of
organic beings may have passed away, and yet have left behind, in the
particular region under contemplation, no trace of their existence.</p>

<p>To a mind unconscious of these intermediate events, the passage from
one state of things to another must appear so violent, that the idea of
revolutions in the system inevitably suggests itself. The imagination is
as much perplexed by the deception, as it might be if two distant points
in space were suddenly brought into immediate proximity. Let us
suppose, for a moment, that a philosopher should lie down to sleep in
some arctic wilderness, and then be transferred by a power, such as we
read of in tales of enchantment, to a valley in a tropical country, where,
on awaking, he might find himself surrounded by birds of brilliant plumage,
and all the luxuriance of animal and vegetable forms of which
Nature is so prodigal in those regions. The most reasonable supposition,
perhaps, which he could make, if by the necromancer's art he were
placed in such a situation, would be, that he was dreaming; and if a
geologist form theories under a similar delusion, we cannot expect him
to preserve more consistency in his speculations than in the train of ideas
in an ordinary dream.</p>

<p>It may afford, perhaps, a lively illustration of the principle here insisted
upon, if I recall to the reader's recollection the legend of the Seven
Sleepers. The scene of that popular fable was placed in the two centuries
which elapsed between the reign of the emperor Decius and the
death of Theodosius the younger. In that interval of time (between
the years 249 and 450 of our era) the union of the Roman Empire had
been dissolved, and some of its fairest provinces overrun by the barbarians
of the north. The seat of government had passed from Rome to
Constantinople, and the throne from a pagan persecutor to a succession
of Christian and orthodox princes. The genius of the empire had been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
humbled in the dust, and the altars of Diana and Hercules were on the
point of being transferred to Catholic saints and martyrs. The legend
relates, "that when Decius was still persecuting the Christians, seven
noble youths of Ephesus concealed themselves in a spacious cavern in
the side of an adjacent mountain, where they were doomed to perish
by the tyrant, who gave orders that the entrance should be firmly secured
with a pile of huge stones. They immediately fell into a deep
slumber, which was miraculously prolonged, without injuring the powers
of life, during a period of 187 years. At the end of that time the
slaves of Adolius, to whom the inheritance of the mountain had descended,
removed the stones to supply materials for some rustic edifice: the
light of the sun darted into the cavern, and the Seven Sleepers were
permitted to awake. After a slumber, as they thought, of a few hours,
they were pressed by the calls of hunger, and resolved that Jamblichus,
one of their number, should secretly return to the city to purchase
bread for the use of his companions. The youth could no longer
recognize the once familiar aspect of his native country, and his surprise
was increased by the appearance of a large cross triumphantly erected
over the principal gate of Ephesus. His singular dress and obsolete
language confounded the baker, to whom he offered an ancient medal
of Decius as the current coin of the empire; and Jamblichus, on the
suspicion of a secret treasure, was dragged before the judge. Their
mutual inquiries produced the amazing discovery, that two centuries
were almost elapsed since Jamblichus and his friends had escaped from
the rage of a pagan tyrant."<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a></p>

<p>This legend was received as authentic throughout the Christian world
before the end of the sixth century, and was afterwards introduced by
Mahomet as a divine revelation into the Koran, and from hence was
adopted and adorned by all the nations from Bengal to Africa who professed
the Mahometan faith. Some vestiges even of a similar tradition
have been discovered in Scandinavia. "This easy and universal belief,"
observes the philosophical historian of the Decline and Fall, "so expressive
of the sense of mankind, may be ascribed to the genuine merit of
the fable itself. We imperceptibly advance from youth to age, without
observing the gradual, but incessant, change of human affairs; and even,
in our larger experience of history, the imagination is accustomed, by a
perpetual series of causes and effects, to unite the most distant revolutions.
But if the interval between two memorable eras could be instantly
annihilated; if it were possible, after a momentary slumber of
two hundred years, to display the new world to the eyes of a spectator
who still retained a lively and recent impression of the old, his surprise
and his reflections would furnish the pleasing subject of a philosophical
romance."<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p><i>Prejudices arising from our peculiar position as inhabitants of the
land.</i>&mdash;The sources of prejudice hitherto considered may be deemed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>peculiar for the most part to the infancy of the science, but others are
common to the first cultivators of geology and to ourselves, and are all
singularly calculated to produce the same deception, and to strengthen
our belief that the course of nature in the earlier ages differed widely
from that now established. Although these circumstances cannot be
fully explained without assuming some things as proved, which it will
be the object of another part of this work to demonstrate, it may be
well to allude to them briefly in this place.</p>

<p>The first and greatest difficulty, then, consists in an habitual unconsciousness
that our position as observers is essentially unfavorable, when
we endeavor to estimate the nature and magnitude of the changes now
in progress. In consequence of our inattention to this subject, we
are liable to serious mistakes in contrasting the present with former
states of the globe. As dwellers on the land, we inhabit about a fourth
part of the surface; and that portion is almost exclusively a theatre of
decay, and not of reproduction. We know, indeed, that new deposits
are annually formed in seas and lakes, and that every year some new
igneous rocks are produced in the bowels of the earth, but we cannot
watch the progress of their formation; and as they are only present to
our minds by the aid of reflection, it requires an effort both of the reason
and the imagination to appreciate duly their importance. It is, therefore,
not surprising that we estimate very imperfectly the result of operations
thus invisible to us; and that, when analogous results of former
epochs are presented to our inspection, we cannot immediately recognize
the analogy. He who has observed the quarrying of stone from a
rock, and has seen it shipped for some distant port, and then endeavors
to conceive what kind of edifice will be raised by the materials, is in the
same predicament as a geologist, who, while he is confined to the land,
sees the decomposition of rocks, and the transportation of matter by
rivers to the sea, and then endeavors to picture to himself the new strata
which Nature is building beneath the waters.</p>

<p><i>Prejudices arising from our not seeing subterranean changes.</i>&mdash;Nor is
his position less unfavorable when, beholding a volcanic eruption, he
tries to conceive what changes the column of lava has produced, in its
passage upwards, on the intersected strata; or what form the melted
matter may assume at great depths on cooling; or what may be the extent
of the subterranean rivers and reservoirs of liquid matter far beneath
the surface. It should, therefore, be remembered, that the task
imposed on those who study the earth's history requires no ordinary
share of discretion; for we are precluded from collating the corresponding
parts of the system of things as it exists now, and as it existed at
former periods. If we were inhabitants of another element&mdash;if the great
ocean were our domain, instead of the narrow limits of the land, our
difficulties would be considerably lessened; while, on the other hand,
there can be little doubt, although the reader may, perhaps, smile at the
bare suggestion of such an idea, that an amphibious being, who should
possess our faculties, would still more easily arrive at sound theoretical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
opinions in geology, since he might behold, on the one hand, the decomposition
of rocks in the atmosphere, or the transportation of matter by
running water; and, on the other, examine the deposition of sediment
in the sea, and the imbedding of animal and vegetable remains in new
strata. He might ascertain, by direct observation, the action of a mountain
torrent, as well as of a marine current; might compare the products
of volcanoes poured out upon the land with those ejected beneath the
waters; and might mark, on the one hand, the growth of the forest,
and, on the other, that of the coral reef. Yet, even with these advantages,
he would be liable to fall into the greatest errors, when endeavoring
to reason on rocks of subterranean origin. He would seek in vain,
within the sphere of his observation, for any direct analogy to the process
of their formation, and would therefore be in danger of attributing
them, wherever they are upraised to view, to some "primeval state of
nature."</p>

<p>But if we may be allowed so far to indulge the imagination, as to
suppose a being entirely confined to the nether world&mdash;some "dusky
melancholy sprite," like Umbriel, who could "flit on sooty pinions to
the central earth," but who was never permitted to "sully the fair face
of light," and emerge into the regions of water and of air; and if this
being should busy himself in investigating the structure of the globe, he
might frame theories the exact converse of those usually adopted by
human philosophers. He might infer that the stratified rocks, containing
shells and other organic remains, were the oldest of created things,
belonging to some original and nascent state of the planet. "Of these
masses," he might say, "whether they consist of loose incoherent sand,
soft clay, or solid stone, none have been formed in modern times. Every
year some part of them are broken and shattered by earthquakes, or
melted by volcanic fire; and when they cool down slowly from a state
of fusion, they assume a new and more crystalline form, no longer exhibiting
that stratified disposition and those curious impressions and fantastic
markings, by which they were previously characterized. This
process cannot have been carried on for an indefinite time, for in that
case all the stratified rocks would long ere this have been fused and
crystallized. It is therefore probable that the whole planet once consisted
of these mysterious and curiously bedded formations at a time
when the volcanic fire had not yet been brought into activity. Since
that period there seems to have been a gradual development of heat;
and this augmentation we may expect to continue till the whole globe
shall be in a state of fluidity and incandescence."</p>

<p>Such might be the system of the Gnome at the very time that the
followers of Leibnitz, reasoning on what they saw on the outer surface,
might be teaching the opposite doctrine of gradual refrigeration, and
averring that the earth had begun its career as a fiery comet, and might
be destined hereafter to become a frozen mass. The tenets of the
schools of the nether and of the upper world would be directly opposed
to each other, for both would partake of the prejudices inevitably re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>sulting
from the continual contemplation of one class of phenomena to
the exclusion of another. Man observes the annual decomposition of
crystalline and igneous rocks, and may sometimes see their conversion
into stratified deposits; but he cannot witness the reconversion of the
sedimentary into the crystalline by subterranean fire. He is in the habit
of regarding all the sedimentary rocks as more recent than the unstratified,
for the same reason that we may suppose him to fall into the opposite
error if he saw the origin of the igneous class only.</p>

<p>It was not an impossible contingency, that astronomers might have
been placed at some period in a situation much resembling that in which
the geologist seems to stand at present. If the Italians, for example, in
the early part of the twelfth century, had discovered at Amalfi, instead
of the pandects of Justinian, some ancient manuscripts filled with astronomical
observations relating to a period of three thousand years,
and made by some ancient geometers who possessed optical instruments
as perfect as any in modern Europe, they would probably, on consulting
these memorials, have come to a conclusion that there had been a
great revolution in the solar and sidereal systems. "Many primary and
secondary planets," they might say, "are enumerated in these tables,
which exist no longer. Their positions are assigned with such precision
that we may assure ourselves that there is nothing in their place at present
but the blue ether. Where one star is visible to us, these documents
represent several thousands. Some of those which are now
single consisted then of two separate bodies, often distinguished by different
colors, and revolving periodically round a common centre of gravity.
There is nothing analogous to them in the universe at present;
for they were neither fixed stars nor planets, but seem to have stood in
the mutual relation of sun and planet to each other. We must conclude,
therefore, that there has occurred, at no distant period, a tremendous
catastrophe, whereby thousands of worlds have been annihilated
at once, and some heavenly bodies absorbed into the substance of
others."</p>

<p>When such doctrines had prevailed for ages, the discovery of some
of the worlds, supposed to have been lost (the satellites of Jupiter, for
example), by aid of the first rude telescope invented after the revival
of science, would not dissipate the delusion, for the whole burden of
proof would now be thrown on those who insisted on the stability of
the system from a remote period, and these philosophers would be required
to demonstrate the existence of <i>all</i> the worlds said to have been
annihilated.</p>

<p>Such popular prejudices would be most unfavorable to the advancement
of astronomy; for, instead of persevering in the attempt to improve
their instruments, and laboriously to make and record observations,
the greater number would despair of verifying the continued
existence of the heavenly bodies not visible to the naked eye. Instead
of confessing the extent of their ignorance, and striving to remove it by
bringing to light new facts, they would indulge in the more easy and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
indolent employment of framing imaginary theories concerning catastrophes
and mighty revolutions in the system of the universe.</p>

<p>For more than two centuries the shelly strata of the Subapennine hills
afforded matter of speculation to the early geologists of Italy, and few
of them had any suspicion that similar deposits were then forming in
the neighboring sea. They were as unconscious of the continued action
of causes still producing similar effects, as the astronomers, in the case
above supposed, of the existence of certain heavenly bodies still giving
and reflecting light, and performing their movements as of old. Some
imagined that the strata, so rich in organic remains, instead of being
due to secondary agents, had been so created in the beginning of things
by the fiat of the Almighty. Others, as we have seen, ascribed the
imbedded fossil bodies to some plastic power which resided in the earth
in the early ages of the world. In what manner were these dogmas at
length exploded? The fossil relics were carefully compared with their
living analogues, and all doubts as to their organic origin were eventually
dispelled. So, also, in regard to the nature of the containing
beds of mud, sand, and limestone: those parts of the bottom of the sea
were examined where shells are now becoming annually entombed in
new deposits. Donati explored the bed of the Adriatic, and found the
closest resemblance between the strata there forming, and those which
constituted hills above a thousand feet high in various parts of the
Italian peninsula. He ascertained by dredging that living testacea
were there grouped together in precisely the same manner as were
their fossil analogues in the inland strata; and while some of the recent
shells of the Adriatic were becoming incrusted with calcareous rock, he
observed that others had been newly buried in sand and clay, precisely
as fossil shells occur in the Subapennine hills. This discovery of the
identity of modern and ancient submarine operations was not made
without the aid of artificial instruments, which, like the telescope,
brought phenomena into view not otherwise within the sphere of human
observation.</p>

<p>In like manner, the volcanic rocks of the Vicentin had been studied
in the beginning of the last century; but no geologist suspected, before
the time of Arduino, that these were composed of ancient submarine lavas.
During many years of controversy, the popular opinion inclined to a belief
that basalt and rocks of the same class had been precipitated from a
chaotic fluid, or an ocean which rose at successive periods over the continents,
charged with the component elements of the rocks in question.
Few will now dispute that it would have been difficult to invent a theory
more distant from the truth; yet we must cease to wonder that it gained
so many proselytes, when we remember that its claims to probability arose
partly from the very circumstance of its confirming the assumed want of
analogy between geological causes and those now in action. By what train
of investigations were geologists induced at length to reject these views,
and to assent to the igneous origin of the trappean formations? By an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
examination of volcanoes now active, and by comparing their structure
and the composition of their lavas with the ancient trap-rocks.</p>

<p>The establishment, from time to time, of numerous points of identification,
drew at length from geologists a reluctant admission, that there was
more correspondence between the condition of the globe at remote eras
and now, and more uniformity in the laws which have regulated the
changes of its surface, than they at first imagined. If, in this state of the
science, they still despaired of reconciling every class of geological phenomena
to the operations of ordinary causes, even by straining analogy to
the utmost limits of credibility, we might have expected, at least, that the
balance of probability would now have been presumed to incline towards
the close analogy of the ancient and modern causes. But, after repeated
experience of the failure of attempts to speculate on geological monuments,
as belonging to a distinct order of things, new sects continued to persevere
in the principles adopted by their predecessors. They still began, as
each new problem presented itself, whether relating to the animate or inanimate
world, to assume an original and dissimilar order of nature; and
when at length they approximated, or entirely came round to an opposite
opinion, it was always with the feeling, that they were conceding what they
had been justified <i>&agrave; priori</i> in deeming improbable. In a word, the same
men who, as natural philosophers, would have been most incredulous respecting
any extraordinary deviations from the known course of nature, if
reported to have happened <i>in their own time</i>, were equally disposed, as geologists,
to expect the proofs of such deviations at every period of the past.</p>

<p>I shall proceed in the following chapters to enumerate some of the principal
difficulties still opposed to the theory of the uniform nature and energy
of the causes which have worked successive changes in the crust of the
earth, and in the condition of its living inhabitants. The discussion of so
important a question on the present occasion may appear premature, but
it is one which naturally arises out of a review of the former history of
the science. It is, of course, impossible to enter into such speculative
topics, without occasionally carrying the novice beyond his depth, and
appealing to facts and conclusions with which he will be unacquainted,
until he has studied some elementary work on geology, but it may be
useful to excite his curiosity, and lead him to study such works by calling
his attention at once to some of the principal points of controversy.<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

<h4>CHAPTER VI.</h4>

<h6>DOCTRINE OF THE DISCORDANCE OF THE ANCIENT AND MODERN
CAUSES OF CHANGE CONTROVERTED.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Climate of the Northern Hemisphere formerly different&mdash;Direct proofs from the
organic remains of the Italian strata&mdash;Proofs from analogy derived from extinct
quadrupeds&mdash;Imbedding of animals in icebergs&mdash;Siberian
mammoths&mdash;Evidence in regard to temperature, from the fossils of tertiary and secondary
rocks&mdash;From the plants of the coal formation&mdash;Northern limit of these fossils&mdash;Whether
such plants could endure the long continuance of an arctic night.</p></div>

<p><i>Climate of the Northern hemisphere formerly different.</i>&mdash;Proofs of
former revolutions in climate, as deduced from fossil remains, have afforded
one of the most popular objections to the theory which endeavors
to explain all geological changes by reference to those now in
progress on the earth. The probable causes, therefore, of fluctuations
in climate, may first be treated of.</p>

<p>That the climate of the Northern hemisphere has undergone an important
change, and that its mean annual temperature must once have
more nearly resembled that now experienced within the tropics, was the
opinion of some of the first naturalists who investigated the contents of
the ancient strata. Their conjecture became more probable when the
shells and corals of the older tertiary and many secondary rocks were
carefully examined; for the organic remains of these formations were
found to be intimately connected by generic affinity with species now
living in warmer latitudes. At a later period, many reptiles, such as
turtles, tortoises, and large saurian animals, were discovered in European
formations in great abundance; and they supplied new and powerful
arguments, from analogy, in support of the doctrine, that the heat
of the climate had been great when our secondary strata were deposited.
Lastly, when the botanist turned his attention to the specific determination
of fossil plants, the evidence acquired still fuller confirmation; for
the flora of a country is peculiarly influenced by temperature: and the
ancient vegetation of the earth might have been expected more readily
than the forms of animals, to have afforded conflicting proofs, had the
popular theory been without foundation. When the examination of fossil
remains was extended to rocks in the most northern parts of Europe
and North America, and even to the Arctic regions, indications of the
same revolution in climate were discovered.</p>

<p>It cannot be said, that in this, as in many other departments of
geology, we have investigated the phenomena of former eras, and neglected
those of the present state of things. On the contrary, since the
first agitation of this interesting question, the accessions to our knowledge
of living animals and plants have been immense, and have far<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
surpassed all the data previously obtained for generalizing on the relation
of certain types of organization to particular climates. The tropical
and temperate zones of South America and of Australia have been explored;
and, on close comparison, it has been found that scarcely any
of the species of the animate creation in these extensive continents are
identical with those inhabiting the old world. Yet the zoologist and
botanist, well acquainted with the geographical distribution of organic
beings in other parts of the globe, would have been able, if distinct
groups of species had been presented to them from these regions, to
recognize those which had been collected from latitudes within, and
those which were brought from without the tropics.</p>

<p>Before I attempt to explain the probable causes of great vicissitudes
of temperature on the earth's surface, I shall take a rapid view of some
of the principal data which appear to support the popular opinions now
entertained on the subject. To insist on the soundness of these inferences,
is the more necessary, because some zoologists have undertaken to
vindicate the uniformity of the laws of nature, not by accounting for
former fluctuations in climate, but by denying the value of the evidence
in their favor.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p><i>Proofs from fossil shells in tertiary strata.</i>&mdash;In Sicily, Calabria, and
in the neighborhood of Naples, the fossil testacea of the most modern
tertiary formations belong almost entirely to species now inhabiting the
Mediterranean; but as we proceed northwards in the Italian peninsula
we find in the strata called Subapennine an assemblage of fossil shells
departing somewhat more widely from the type of the neighboring
seas. The proportion of species identifiable with those now living in
the Mediterranean is still considerable; but it no longer predominates,
as in the South of Italy and part of Sicily, over the unknown species.
Although occurring in localities which are removed several degrees farther
from the equator (as at Sienna, Parma, Asti, &amp;c.), the shells yield
clear indications of a warmer climate. This evidence is of great weight,
and is not neutralized by any facts of a conflicting character; such, for
instance, as the association, in the same group, of individuals referable
to species now confined to arctic regions. Whenever any of the fossil
shells are identified with living species foreign to the Mediterranean, it
is not in the Northern Ocean, but nearer the tropics, that they must be
sought: on the other hand, the associated unknown species belong, for
the most part, to <i>genera</i> which are now most largely developed in equinoctial
regions, as, for example, the genera Cancellaria, Cassidaria,
Pleurotoma, Conus, and Cypr&aelig;a.</p>

<p>On comparing the fossils of the tertiary deposits of Paris and London
with those of Bourdeaux, and these again with the more modern strata
of Sicily, we should at first expect that they would each indicate a
higher temperature in proportion as they are situated farther to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>south. But the contrary is true; of the shells belonging to these several
groups, whether freshwater or marine, some are of extinct, others of
living species. Those found in the older, or Eocene, deposits of Paris
and London, although six or seven degrees to the north of the Miocene
strata at Bourdeaux, afford evidence of a warmer climate; while those
of Bourdeaux imply that the sea in which they lived was of a higher
temperature than that of Sicily, where the shelly strata were formed six
or seven degrees nearer to the equator. In these cases the greater antiquity
of the several formations (the Parisian being the oldest and the
Sicilian the newest) has more than counterbalanced the influence which
latitude would otherwise exert, and this phenomenon clearly points to a
gradual and successive refrigeration of climate.</p>

<p><i>Siberian Mammoths.</i>&mdash;It will naturally be asked, whether some recent
geological discoveries bringing evidence to light of a colder, or as it has
been termed "glacial epoch," towards the close of the tertiary periods
throughout the northern hemisphere, does not conflict with the theory
above alluded to, of a warmer temperature having prevailed in the eras
of the Eocene, Miocene, and Pliocene formations. In answer to this inquiry,
it may certainly be affirmed, that an oscillation of climate has occurred
in times immediately antecedent to the peopling of the earth by
man; but proof of the intercalation of a less genial climate at an era
when nearly all the marine and terrestrial testacea had already become
specifically the same as those now living, by no means rebuts the conclusion
previously drawn, in favor of a warmer condition of the globe,
during the ages which elapsed while the tertiary strata were deposited.
In some of the most superficial patches of sand, gravel, and loam, scattered
very generally over Europe, and containing recent shells, the remains
of extinct species of land quadrupeds have been found, especially
in places where the alluvial matter appears to have been washed into
small lakes, or into depressions in the plains bordering ancient rivers.
Similar deposits have also been lodged in rents and caverns of rocks,
where they may have been swept in by land floods, or introduced by
engulphed rivers during changes in the physical geography of these
countries. The various circumstances under which the bones of animals
have been thus preserved, will be more fully considered
hereafter;<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> I shall only state here, that among the extinct mammalia thus entombed,
we find species of the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, bear, hy&aelig;na,
lion, tiger, monkey (macacus<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>), and many others; consisting partly of
genera now confined to warmer regions.</p>

<p>It is certainly probable that when some of these quadrupeds abounded
in Europe, the climate was milder than that now experienced. The
hippopotamus, for example, is now only met with where the temperature
of the water is warm and nearly uniform throughout the year, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>where the rivers are never frozen over. Yet when the great fossil species
(<i>Hippopotamus major</i>, Cuv.) inhabited England, the testacea of our
country were nearly the same as those now existing, and the climate
cannot be supposed to have been very hot. The bones of this animal
have lately been found by Mr. Strickland, together with those of a bear
and other mammalia, at Cropthorn, near Evesham, in Worcestershire, in
alluvial sand, together with twenty-three species of terrestrial and freshwater
shells, all, with two exceptions, of British species. The bed of
sand, containing the shells and bones, reposes on lias, and is covered with
alternating strata of gravel, sand, and loam.<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<p>The mammoth also appears to have existed in England when the
temperature of our latitudes could not have been very different from
that which now prevails; for remains of this animal have been found at
North Cliff, in the county of York, in a lacustrine formation, in which
all the land and freshwater shells, thirteen in number, can be identified
with species and varieties now existing in that county. Bones of the
bison, also, an animal now inhabiting a cold or temperate climate, have
been found in the same place. That these quadrupeds, and the indigenous
species of testacea associated with them, were all contemporary
inhabitants of Yorkshire, has been established by unequivocal proof.
The Rev. W. V. Vernon Harcourt caused a pit to be sunk to the depth
of twenty-two feet through undisturbed strata, in which the remains of
the mammoth were found imbedded, together with the shells, in a deposit
which had evidently resulted from tranquil waters.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p>In the valley of the Thames, as at Ilford and Grays, in Essex, bones
of the elephant and rhinoceros occur in strata abounding in freshwater
shells of the genera Unio, Cyclas, Paludina, Valvata, Ancylus, and
others. These fossil shells belong for the most part to species now living
in the same district, yet some few of them are extinct, as, for example,
a species of Cyrena, a genus no longer inhabiting Europe, and now
entirely restricted to warmer latitudes.</p>

<p>When reasoning on such phenomena, the reader must always bear in
mind that the fossil individuals belonged to <i>species</i> of elephant, rhinoceros,
hippopotamus, bear, tiger, and hy&aelig;na, distinct from those which
now dwell within or near the tropics. Dr. Fleming, in a discussion on
this subject, has well remarked that a near resemblance in form and osteological
structure is not always followed, in the existing creation, by
a similarity of geographical distribution; and we must therefore be on
our guard against deciding too confidently, from mere analogy of anatomical
structure, respecting the habits and physiological peculiarities of
<i>species</i> now no more. "The zebra delights to roam over the tropical
plains, while the horse can maintain its existence throughout an Iceland
winter. The buffalo, like the zebra, prefers a high temperature, and
cannot thrive even where the common ox prospers. The musk-ox, on
the other hand, though nearly resembling the buffalo, prefers the stinted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>herbage of the arctic regions, and is able, by its periodical migrations,
to outlive a northern winter. The jackal (<i>Canis aureus</i>) inhabits Africa,
the warmer parts of Asia, and Greece; while the isatis (<i>Canis lagopus</i>)
resides in the arctic regions. The African hare and the polar hare have
their geographical distribution expressed in their trivial names;"<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> and
different species of bears thrive in tropical, temperate, and arctic latitudes.</p>

<p>Recent investigations have placed beyond all doubt the important fact
that a species of tiger, identical with that of Bengal, is common in the
neighborhood of Lake Aral, near Sussac, in the forty-fifth degree of
north latitude; and from time to time this animal is now seen in Siberia,
in a latitude as far north as the parallel of Berlin and Hamburgh.<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>
Humboldt remarks that the part of Southern Asia now inhabited by this
Indian species of tiger is separated from the Himalaya by two great
chains of mountains, each covered with perpetual snow,&mdash;the chain of
Kuenlun, lat. 35&deg; N., and that of Mouztagh, lat. 42&deg;,&mdash;so that it is impossible
that these animals should merely have made excursions from
India, so as to have penetrated in summer to the forty-eighth and fifty-third
degrees of north latitude. They must remain all the winter north
of the Mouztagh, or Celestial Mountains. The last tiger killed, in 1828,
on the Lena, in lat. 52-1/4&deg;, was in a climate colder than that of Petersburg
and Stockholm.<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<p>We learn from Mr. Hodgson's account of the mammalia of Nepal,
that the tiger is sometimes found at the very edge of perpetual snow in
the Himalaya;<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> and Pennant mentions that it is found among the snows
of Mount Ararat in Armenia. The jaguar, also, has been seen in America,
wandering from Mexico, as far north as Kentucky, lat. 37&deg; N.,<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> and
even as far as 42&deg; S. in South America,&mdash;a latitude which corresponds
to that of the Pyrenees in the northern hemisphere.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> The range of the
puma is still wider, for it roams from the equator to the Straits of Magellan,
being often seen at Port Famine, in lat. 53&deg; 38' S.</p>

<p>A new species of panther (<i>Felis irbis</i>), covered with long hair, has
been discovered in Siberia, evidently inhabiting, like the tiger, a region
north of the Celestial Mountains, which are in lat. 42&deg;.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p>The two-horned African rhinoceros occurs without the tropics at the
Cape of Good Hope, in lat. 34&deg; 29' S., where it is accompanied by the
elephant, hippopotamus, and hy&aelig;na. Here the migration of all these
species towards the south is arrested by the ocean; but if the continent
had been prolonged still farther, and the land had been of moderate elevation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
it is very probable that they might have extended their range to
a greater distance from the tropics.</p>

<p>Now, if the Indian tiger can range in our own times to the southern
borders of Siberia, or skirt the snows of the Himalaya, and if the puma
can reach the fifty-third degree of latitude in South America, we may
easily understand how large species of the same <i>genera</i> may once have
inhabited our temperate climates. The mammoth (<i>E. primigenius</i>), already
alluded to, as occurring fossil in England, was decidedly different
from the two existing species of elephants, one of which is limited to
Asia, south of the 31&deg; of N. lat., the other to Africa, where it extends,
as before stated, as far south as the Cape of Good Hope. The bones
of the great fossil species are very widely spread over Europe and North
America; but are nowhere in such profusion as in Siberia, particularly
near the shores of the Frozen Ocean. Are we, then, to conclude that this
animal preferred a polar climate? If so, it may well be asked, by what
food was it sustained, and why does it not still survive near the arctic
circle?<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p>Pallas and other writers describe the bones of the mammoth as abounding
throughout all the Lowlands of Siberia, stretching in a direction west
and east, from the borders of Europe to the extreme point nearest America,
and south and north, from the base of the mountains of Central Asia
to the shores of the Arctic Sea. (See map, <a href="#f1">fig. 1</a>.) Within this space,
scarcely inferior in area to the whole of Europe, fossil ivory has been
collected almost everywhere, on the banks of the Irtish, Obi, Yenesei,
Lena, and other rivers. The elephantine remains do not occur in the
marshes and low plains, but where the banks of the rivers present lofty
precipices of sand and clay, from which circumstance Pallas very justly
inferred that, if sections could be obtained, similar bones might be found
in all the elevated lands intervening between the great rivers. Strahlenberg,
indeed, had stated, before the time of Pallas, that wherever any of
the great rivers overflowed and cut out fresh channels during floods, more
fossil remains of the same kind were invariably disclosed.</p>

<p class="center2">Fig. 1. <i>Map showing the course of the Siberian rivers from south to north, from temperate to arctic regions, in the country where the
fossil bones of the Mammoth abound.</i></p></div>

<p>As to the position of the bones, Pallas found them in some places imbedded
together with marine remains; in others, simply with fossil wood,
or lignite, such as, he says, might have been derived from carbonized
peat. On the banks of the Yenesei, below the city of Krasnojarsk, in
lat. 56&deg;, he observed grinders, and bones of elephants, in strata of yellow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
and red loam, alternating with coarse sand and gravel, in which was
also much petrified wood of the willow and other trees. Neither here
nor in the neighboring country were there any marine shells, but merely
layers of black coal.<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> But grinders of the mammoth were collected
much farther down the same river, near the sea, in lat. 70&deg;, mixed with
<i>marine</i> petrifactions.<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Many other places in Siberia are cited by Pallas,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
where sea shells and fishes' teeth accompany the bones of the mammoth,
rhinoceros, and Siberian buffalo, or bison (<i>Bos priscus</i>). But it is not
on the Obi nor the Yenesei, but on the Lena, farther to the east, where,
in the same parallels of latitude, the cold is far more intense, that fossil
remains have been found in the most wonderful state of preservation.
In 1772, Pallas obtained from Wiljuiskoi, in lat. 64&deg;, from the banks of
the Wiljui, a tributary of the Lena, the carcass of a rhinoceros (<i>R.
tichorhinus</i>), taken from the sand in which it must have remained congealed
for ages, the soil of that region being always frozen to within a
slight depth of the surface. This carcass was compared to a natural
mummy, and emitted an odor like putrid flesh, part of the skin being
still covered with black and gray hairs. So great, indeed, was the
quantity of hair on the foot and head conveyed to St. Petersburg, that
Pallas asked whether the rhinoceros of the Lena might not have been
an inhabitant of the temperate regions of middle Asia, its clothing being
so much warmer than that of the African rhinoceros.<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>Professor Brandt, of St. Petersburg, in a letter to Baron Alex. Von
Humboldt, dated 1846, adds the following particulars respecting this
wonderful fossil relic:&mdash;"I have been so fortunate as to extract from
cavities in the molar teeth of the Wiljui rhinoceros a small quantity of
its half-chewed food, among which fragments of pine leaves, one-half of
the seed of a polygonaceous plant, and very minute portions of wood
with porous cells (or small fragments of coniferous wood), were still
recognizable. It was also remarkable, on a close investigation of the
head, that the blood-vessels discovered in the interior of the mass
appeared filled, even to the capillary vessels, with a brown mass
(coagulated blood), which in many places still showed the red color of
blood."<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p>After more than thirty years, the entire carcass of a mammoth (or
extinct species of elephant) was obtained in 1803, by Mr. Adams, much
farther to the north. It fell from a mass of ice, in which it had been
encased, on the banks of the Lena, in lat. 70&deg;; and so perfectly had the
soft parts of the carcass been preserved, that the flesh, as it lay, was
devoured by wolves and bears. This skeleton is still in the museum of
St. Petersburg, the head retaining its integument and many of the ligaments
entire. The skin of the animal was covered, first, with black
bristles, thicker than horse hair, from twelve to sixteen inches in length;
secondly, with hair of a reddish brown color, about four inches long;
and thirdly, with wool of the same color as the hair, about an inch in
length. Of the fur, upwards of thirty pounds' weight were gathered
from the wet sand-bank. The individual was nine feet high and sixteen
feet long, without reckoning the large curved tusks: a size rarely surpassed
by the largest living male elephants.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>It is evident, then, that the mammoth, instead of being naked, like the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>living Indian and African elephants, was enveloped in a thick shaggy
covering of fur, probably as impenetrable to rain and cold as that of the
musk ox.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> The species may have been fitted by nature to withstand
the vicissitudes of a northern climate; and it is certain that, from the
moment when the carcasses, both of the rhinoceros and elephant, above
described, were buried in Siberia, in latitudes 64&deg; and 70&deg; N., the soil
must have remained frozen, and the atmosphere nearly as cold as at
this day.</p>

<p>The most recent discoveries made in 1843 by Mr. Middendorf, a distinguished
Russian naturalist, and which he communicated to me in
September, 1846, afford more precise information as to the climate of
the Siberian lowlands, at the period when the extinct quadrupeds were
entombed. One elephant was found on the Tas, between the Obi and
Yenesei, near the arctic circle, about lat. 66&deg; 30' N., with some parts
of the flesh in so perfect a state that the bulb of the eye is now preserved
in the museum at Moscow. Another carcass, together with a
young individual of the same species, was met with in the same year,
1843, in lat. 75&deg; 15' N., near the river Taimyr, with the flesh decayed.
It was imbedded in strata of clay and sand, with erratic blocks, at about
15 feet above the level of the sea. In the same deposit Mr. Middendorf
observed the trunk of a larch tree (<i>Pinus larix</i>), the same wood
as that now carried down in abundance by the Taimyr to the Arctic
Sea. There were also associated fossil shells of <i>living northern</i> species,
and which are moreover characteristic of the drift or <i>glacial</i> deposits of
Europe. Among these <i>Nucula pygm&aelig;a</i>, <i>Tellina calcarea</i>, <i>Mya truncata</i>,
and <i>Saxicava rugosa</i> were conspicuous.</p>

<p>So fresh is the ivory throughout northern Russia, that, according to
Tilesius, thousands of fossil tusks have been collected and used in turning;
yet others are still procured and sold in great plenty. He declares
his belief that the bones still left in northern Russia must greatly exceed
in number all the elephants now living on the globe.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>
<p>We are as yet ignorant of the entire geographical range of the mammoth;
but its remains have been recently collected from the cliffs of
frozen mud and ice on the east side of Behring's Straits, in Eschscholtz's
Bay, in Russian America, lat. 66&deg; N. As the cliffs waste
away by the thawing of the ice, tusks and bones fall out, and a strong
odor of animal matter is exhaled from the mud.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<p>On considering all the facts above enumerated, it seems reasonable to
imagine that a large region in central Asia, including, perhaps, the
southern half of Siberia, enjoyed, at no very remote period in the earth's
history, a temperate climate, sufficiently mild to afford food for numerous
herds of elephants and rhinoceroses, <i>of species distinct from those
now living</i>. It has usually been taken for granted that herbivorous
animals of large size require a very luxuriant vegetation for their support;
but this opinion is, according to Mr. Darwin, completely erroneous:&mdash;"It
has been derived," he says, "from our acquaintance with
India and the Indian islands, where the mind has been accustomed to
associate troops of elephants with noble forests and impenetrable jungles.
But the southern parts of Africa, from the tropic of Capricorn to
the Cape of Good Hope, although sterile and desert, are remarkable for
the number and great bulk of the indigenous quadrupeds. We there
meet with an elephant, five species of rhinoceros, a hippopotamus, a
giraffe, the bos caffer, the elan, two zebras, the quagga, two gnus, and
several antelopes. Nor must we suppose, that while the species are
numerous, the individuals of each kind are few. Dr. Andrew Smith
saw, in one day's march, in lat. 24&deg; S., without wandering to any great
distance on either side, about 150 rhinoceroses, with several herds of
giraffes, and his party had killed, on the previous night, eight hippopotamuses.
Yet the country which they inhabited was thinly covered
with grass and bushes about four feet high, and still more thinly with
mimosa-trees, so that the wagons of the travellers were not prevented
from proceeding in a nearly direct line."<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<p>In order to explain how so many animals can find support in this region,
it is suggested that the underwood, of which their food chiefly
consists, may contain much nutriment in a small bulk, and also that the
vegetation has a rapid growth; for no sooner is a part consumed than
its place, says Dr. Smith, is supplied by a fresh stock. Nevertheless,
after making every allowance for this successive production and consumption,
it is clear, from the facts above cited, that the quantity of
food required by the larger herbivora is much less than we have usually
imagined. Mr. Darwin conceives that the amount of vegetation supported
at any one time by Great Britain may exceed, in a ten-fold ratio,
the quantity existing on an equal area in the interior parts of Southern
Africa.<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> It is remarked, moreover, in illustration of the small connec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>tion
discoverable between abundance of food and the magnitude of indigenous
mammalia, that while in the desert part of Southern Africa
there are so many huge animals; in Brazil, where the splendor and exuberance
of the vegetation are unrivalled, there is not a single wild
quadruped of large size.<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>It would doubtless be impossible for herds of mammoths and rhinoceroses
to subsist, at present, throughout the year, even in the southern
part of Siberia, covered as it is with snow during winter; but there is
no difficulty in supposing a vegetation capable of nourishing these great
quadrupeds to have once flourished between the latitudes 40&deg; and
60&deg; N.</p>

<p>Dr. Fleming has hinted, that "the kind of food which the existing
species of elephant prefers, will not enable us to determine, or even to
offer a probable conjecture, concerning that of the extinct species. No
one acquainted with the gramineous character of the food of our fallow-deer,
stag, or roe, would have assigned a lichen to the reindeer."</p>

<p>Travellers mention that, even now, when the climate of eastern Asia
is so much colder than the same parallels of latitude farther west, there
are woods not only of fir, but of birch, poplar, and alder, on the banks
of the Lena, as far north as latitude 60&deg;.</p>

<p>It has, moreover, been suggested, that as, in our own times, the
northern animals migrate, so the Siberian elephant and rhinoceros may
have wandered towards the north in summer. The musk oxen annually
desert their winter quarters in the south, and cross the sea upon the ice,
to graze for four months, from May to September, on the rich pasturage
of Melville Island, in lat. 75&deg;. The mammoths, without passing so
far beyond the arctic circle, may nevertheless have made excursions,
during the heat of a brief northern summer, from the central or temperate
parts of Asia to the sixtieth parallel of latitude.</p>

<p>Now, in this case, the preservation of their bones, or even occasionally
of their entire carcasses, in ice or frozen soil, may be accounted for,
without resorting to speculations concerning sudden revolutions in the
former state and climate of the earth's surface. We are entitled to assume,
that, in the time of the extinct elephant and rhinoceros, the Lowland
of Siberia was less extensive towards the north than now; for we
have seen (p. 80) that the strata of this Lowland, in which the fossil
bones lie buried, were originally deposited beneath the sea; and we
know, from the facts brought to light in Wrangle's Voyage, in the years
1821, 1822, and 1823, that a slow upheaval of the land along the borders
of the Icy Sea is now constantly taking place, similar to that experienced
in part of Sweden. In the same manner, then, as the shores
of the Gulf of Bothnia are extended, not only by the influx of sediment
brought down by rivers, but also by the elevation and consequent drying
up of the bed of the sea, so a like combination of causes may, in
modern times, have been extending the low tract of land where marine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>shells and fossil bones occur in Siberia.<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Such a change in the physical
geography of that region, implying a constant augmentation in the
quantity of arctic land, would, according to principles to be explained
in the next chapter, tend to increase the severity of the winters. We
may conclude, therefore, that, before the land reached so far to the
north, the temperature of the Siberian winter and summer was more
nearly equalized; and a greater degree of winter's cold may, even more
than a general diminution of the mean annual temperature, have finally
contributed to the extermination of the mammoth and its contemporaries.</p>

<p>On referring to the map (p. 79), the reader will see how all the
great rivers of Siberia flow at present from south to north, from temperate
to arctic regions, and they are all liable, like the Mackenzie, in
North America, to remarkable floods, in consequence of flowing in this
direction. For they are filled with running water in their upper or
southern course when completely frozen over for several hundred miles
near their mouths, where they remain blocked up by ice for six months
in every year. The descending waters, therefore, finding no open channel,
rush over the ice, often changing their direction, and sweeping along
forests and prodigious quantities of soil and gravel mixed with ice.
Now the rivers of Siberia are among the largest in the world, the
Yenesei having a course of 2500, the Lena of 2000 miles; so that we
may easily conceive that the bodies of animals which fall into their
waters may be transported to vast distances towards the Arctic Sea,
and, before arriving there, may be stranded upon and often frozen into
thick ice. Afterwards, when the ice breaks up, they may be floated
still farther towards the ocean, until at length they become buried in
fluviatile and submarine deposits near the mouths of rivers.</p>

<p>Humboldt remarks that near the mouths of the Lena a considerable
thickness of frozen soil may be found at all seasons at the depth of a
few feet; so that if a carcass be once imbedded in mud and ice in such
a region and in such a climate, its putrefaction may be arrested for indefinite
ages.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> According to Prof. Von Baer of St. Petersburg, the
ground is now frozen permanently to the depth of 400 feet, at the town
of Yakutzt, on the western bank of the Lena, in lat. 62&deg; N., 600 miles
distant from the polar sea. Mr. Hedenstrom tells us that, throughout
a wide area in Siberia, the boundary cliffs of the lakes and rivers consist
of alternate layers of earthy materials and ice, in horizontal stratification;<a name="FNanchor_151" id="FNanchor_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a>
and Mr. Middendorf informed us, in 1846, that, in his tour there
three years before, he had bored in Siberia to the depth of seventy feet,
and, after passing through much frozen soil mixed with ice, had come
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>down upon a solid mass of pure transparent ice, the thickness of which,
after penetrating two or three yards, they did not ascertain. We may
conceive, therefore, that even at the period of the mammoth, when the
Lowland of Siberia was less extensive towards the north, and consequently
the climate more temperate than now, the cold may still have
been sufficiently intense to cause the rivers flowing in their present
direction to sweep down from south to north the bodies of drowned
animals, and there bury them in drift ice and frozen mud.</p>

<p>If it be true that the carcass of the mammoth was imbedded in pure
ice, there are two ways in which it may have been frozen in. We may
suppose the animal to have been overwhelmed by drift snow. I have
been informed by Dr. Richardson, that, in the northern parts of America,
comprising regions now inhabited by many herbivorous quadrupeds,
the drift snow is often converted into permanent glaciers. It is
commonly blown over the edges of steep cliffs, so as to form an inclined
talus hundreds of feet high; and when a thaw commences, torrents
rush from the land, and throw down from the top of the cliff alluvial
soil and gravel. This new soil soon becomes covered with vegetation,
and protects the foundation of snow from the rays of the sun. Water
occasionally penetrates into the crevices and pores of the snow; but,
as it soon freezes again, it serves the more rapidly to consolidate the
mass into a compact iceberg. It may sometimes happen that cattle
grazing in a valley at the base of such cliffs, on the borders of a sea or
river, may be overwhelmed, and at length inclosed in solid ice, and
then transported towards the polar regions. Or a herd of mammoths
returning from their summer pastures in the north, may have been surprised,
while crossing a stream, by the sudden congelation of the waters.
The missionary Huc relates, in his travels in Thibet in 1846, that, after
many of his party had been frozen to death, they pitched their tents
on the banks of the Mouroui-Ousson (which lower down becomes the
famous Blue River), and saw from their encampment "some black
shapeless objects ranged in file across the stream. As they advanced
nearer no change either in form or distinctness was apparent; nor was
it till they were quite close, that they recognized in them a troop of the
wild oxen, called Yak by the Thibetans.<a name="FNanchor_152" id="FNanchor_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> There were more than fifty
of them incrusted in the ice. No doubt they had tried to swim across
at the moment of congelation, and had been unable to disengage themselves.
Their beautiful heads, surmounted by huge horns, were still
above the surface, but their bodies were held fast in the ice, which was
so transparent that the position of the imprudent beasts was easily distinguishable;
they looked as if still swimming, but the eagles and
ravens had pecked out their eyes."<a name="FNanchor_153" id="FNanchor_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<p>The foregoing investigations, therefore, lead us to infer that the mammoth,
and some other extinct quadrupeds fitted to live in high latitudes,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>were inhabitants of Northern Asia at a time when the geographical
conditions and climate of that continent were different from the present.
But the age of this fauna was comparatively modern in the earth's history.
It appears that when the oldest or eocene tertiary deposits were
formed, a warm temperature pervaded the European seas and lands.
Shells of the genus Nautilus and other forms characteristic of tropical
latitudes; fossil reptiles, such as the crocodile, turtle, and tortoise;
plants, such as palms, some of them allied to the cocoa-nut, the screw-pine,
the custard-apple, and the acacia, all lead to this conclusion. This
flora and fauna were followed by those of the miocene formation, in
which indications of a southern, but less tropical climate are detected.
Finally, the pliocene deposits, which come next in succession, exhibit
in their organic remains a much nearer approach to the state of things
now prevailing in corresponding latitudes. It was towards the close of
this period that the seas of the northern hemisphere became more and
more filled with floating icebergs often charged with erratic blocks, so
that the waters and the atmosphere were chilled by the melting ice, and
an arctic fauna enabled, for a time, to invade the temperate latitudes
both of N. America and Europe. The extinction of a considerable
number of land quadrupeds and aquatic mollusca was gradually brought
about by the increasing severity of the cold; but many species survived
this revolution in climate, either by their capacity of living under a variety
of conditions, or by migrating for a time to more southern lands
and seas. At length, by modifications in the physical geography of the
northern regions, and the cessation of floating ice on the eastern side of
the Atlantic, the cold was moderated, and a milder climate ensued,
such as we now enjoy in Europe.<a name="FNanchor_154" id="FNanchor_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<p><i>Proofs from fossils in secondary and still older strata.</i>&mdash;A great interval
of time appears to have elapsed between the formation of the
secondary strata, which constitute the principal portion of the elevated
land in Europe, and the origin of the eocene deposits. If we examine
the rocks from the chalk to the new red sandstone inclusive, we find
many distinct assemblages of fossils entombed in them, all of unknown
species, and many of them referable to genera and families now most
abundant between the tropics. Among the most remarkable are reptiles
of gigantic size; some of them herbivorous, others carnivorous,
and far exceeding in size any now known even in the torrid zone. The
genera are for the most part extinct, but some of them, as the crocodile
and monitor, have still representatives in the warmer parts of the
earth. Coral reefs also were evidently numerous in the seas of the
same periods, composed of species often belonging to genera now characteristic
of a tropical climate. The number of large chambered shells
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>also, including the nautilus, leads us to infer an elevated temperature;
and the associated fossil plants, although imperfectly known, tend to
the same conclusion, the Cycade&aelig; constituting the most numerous
family.</p>

<p>But it is from the more ancient coal-deposits that the most extraordinary
evidence has been supplied in proof of the former existence of a
very different climate&mdash;a climate which seems to have been moist, warm,
and extremely uniform, in those very latitudes which are now the colder,
and in regard to temperature, the most variable regions of the globe.
We learn from the researches of Adolphe Brongniart, Goeppert, and
other botanists, that in the flora of the carboniferous era there was a
great predominance of ferns, some of which were arborescent; as, for
example, Caulopteris, Protopteris, and Psarronius; nor can this be accounted
for, as some have supposed, by the greater power which ferns
possess of resisting maceration in water.<a name="FNanchor_155" id="FNanchor_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> This prevalence of ferns indicates
a moist, equable, and temperate climate, and the absence of any
severe cold; for such are the conditions which, at the present day, are
found to be most favorable to that tribe of plants. It is only in the
islands of the tropical oceans, and of the southern temperate zone, such
as Norfolk Island, Otaheite, the Sandwich Islands, Tristan d'Acunha, and
New Zealand, that we find any near approach to that remarkable preponderance
of ferns which is characteristic of the Carboniferous flora.
It has been observed that tree ferns and other forms of vegetation which
flourished most luxuriantly within the tropics, extend to a much greater
distance from the equator in the southern hemisphere than in the northern,
being found even as far as 46&deg; S. latitude in New Zealand.
There is little doubt that this is owing to the more uniform and moist
climate occasioned by the greater proportional area of sea. Next to
ferns and pines, the most abundant vegetable forms in the coal formation
are the Calamites, Lepidodendra, Sigillari&aelig;, and Stigmari&aelig;. These
were formerly considered to be so closely allied to tropical genera, and
to be so much greater in size than the corresponding tribes now inhabiting
equatorial latitudes, that they were thought to imply an extremely
hot, as well as humid and equable climate. But recent discoveries respecting
the structure and relations of these fossil plants, have shown
that they deviated so widely from all existing types in the vegetable
world, that we have more reason to infer from this evidence a widely
different climate in the Carboniferous era, as compared to that now prevailing,
than a temperature extremely elevated.<a name="FNanchor_156" id="FNanchor_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> Palms, if not entirely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>wanting when the strata of the carboniferous group were deposited, appear
to have been exceedingly rare.<a name="FNanchor_157" id="FNanchor_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> The Conifer&aelig;, on the other hand,
so abundantly met with in the coal, resemble Araucari&aelig; in structure, a
family of the fir tribe, characteristic at present of the milder regions of
the southern hemisphere, such as Chili, Brazil, New Holland, and Norfolk
Island.</p>

<p>"In regard to the geographical extent of the ancient vegetation, it
was not confined," says M. Brongniart, "to a small space, as to Europe,
for example; for the same forms are met with again at great distances.
Thus, the coal-plants of North America are, for the most part, identical
with those of Europe, and all belong to the same genera. Some specimens,
also, from Greenland, are referable to ferns, analogous to those
of our European coal-mines."<a name="FNanchor_158" id="FNanchor_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> The fossil plants brought from Melville
Island, although in a very imperfect state, have been supposed to warrant
similar conclusions;<a name="FNanchor_159" id="FNanchor_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> and assuming that they agree with those of
Baffin's Bay, mentioned by M. Brongniart, how shall we explain the
manner in which such a vegetation lived through an arctic night of several
months' duration?<a name="FNanchor_160" id="FNanchor_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p>It may seem premature to discuss this question until the true nature
of the fossil flora of the arctic regions has been more accurately determined;
yet, as the question has attracted some attention, let us assume
for a moment that the coal-plants of Melville Island are strictly analogous
to those of the strata of Northumberland&mdash;would such a fact present
an inexplicable enigma to the vegetable physiologist?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>Plants, it is affirmed, cannot remain in darkness, even for a week,
without serious injury, unless in a torpid state; and if exposed to heat
and moisture they cannot remain torpid, but will grow, and must therefore
perish. If, then, in the latitude of Melville Island, 75&deg; N., a high
temperature, and consequent humidity, prevailed at that period when
we know the arctic seas were filled with corals and large multilocular
shells, how could plants of tropical forms have flourished? Is not the
bright light of equatorial regions as indispensable a condition of their
well-being as the sultry heat of the same countries? and how could
they annually endure a night prolonged for three months?<a name="FNanchor_161" id="FNanchor_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<p>Now, in reply to this objection, we must bear in mind, in the first
place, that, so far as experiments have been made, there is every reason
to conclude, that the range of intensity of light to which living plants
can accommodate themselves is far wider than that of heat. No palms
or tree ferns can live in our temperate latitudes without protection from
the cold; but when placed in hot-houses they grow luxuriantly, even
under a cloudy sky, and where much light is intercepted by the glass
and frame-work. At St. Petersburg, in lat. 60&deg; N., these plants have
been successfully cultivated in hot-houses, although there they must exchange
the perpetual equinox of their native regions, for days and nights
which are alternately protracted to nineteen hours and shortened to
five. How much farther towards the pole they might continue to live,
provided a due quantity of heat and moisture were supplied, has not
yet been determined; but St. Petersburg is probably not the utmost
limit, and we should expect that in lat. 65&deg; at least, where they would
never remain twenty-four hours without enjoying the sun's light, they
might still exist.</p>

<p>It should also be borne in mind, in regard to tree ferns, that they
grow in the gloomiest and darkest parts of the forests of warm and
temperate regions, even extending to nearly the 46th degree of south
latitude in New Zealand. In equatorial countries, says Humboldt, they
abound chiefly in the temperate, humid, and shady parts of <i>mountains</i>.
As we know, therefore, that elevation often compensates for the effect
of latitude in the geographical distribution of plants, we may easily understand
that a class of vegetables, which grows at a certain height in
the torrid zone, would flourish on the plains at greater distances from
the equator, if the temperature, moisture, and other necessary conditions,
were equally uniform throughout the year.</p>

<p>Nor must we forget that in all the examples above alluded to, we
have been speaking of <i>living</i> species; but the coal-plants were of perfectly
distinct species, nay, few of them except the ferns and pines can
be referred to genera or even families of the existing vegetable kingdom.
Having a structure, therefore, and often a form which appears to the
botanist so anomalous, they may also have been endowed with a
differ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>ent constitution, enabling them to bear a greater variation of circumstances
in regard to light. We find that particular species of plants
and tree ferns require at present different degrees of heat; and that
some species can thrive only in the immediate neighborhood of the
equator, others only a distance from it. In the same manner the <i>minimum
of light</i>, sufficient for the now existing species, cannot be taken
as the standard for all analogous tribes that may ever have flourished
on the globe.</p>

<p>But granting that the extreme northern point to which a flora like
that of the Carboniferous era could ever reach, may be somewhere between
the latitudes of 65&deg; and 70&deg;, we should still have to inquire
whether the vegetable remains might not have been drifted from thence,
by rivers and currents, to the parallel of Melville Island, or still farther.
In the northern hemisphere, at present, we see that the materials for
future beds of lignite and coal are becoming amassed in high latitudes,
far from the districts where the forests grew, and on shores where
scarcely a stunted shrub can now exist. The Mackenzie, and other
rivers of North America, carry pines with their roots attached for many
hundred miles towards the north, into the Arctic Sea, where they are
imbedded in deltas, and some of them drifted still farther by currents
towards the pole.</p>

<p>Before we can decide on this question of transportation, we must
know whether the fossil coal-plants occurring in high latitudes bear the
marks of friction and of having decayed previously to fossilization.
Many appearances in our English coal-fields certainly prove that the
plants were not floated from great distances; for the outline of the
stems of succulent species preserve their sharp angles, and others have
their surfaces marked with the most delicate lines and streaks. Long
leaves, also, are attached in many instances to the trunks or branches;<a name="FNanchor_162" id="FNanchor_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>
and leaves, we know, in general, are soon destroyed when steeped in
water, although ferns will retain their forms after an immersion of many
months.<a name="FNanchor_163" id="FNanchor_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> It seems fair to presume, that most of the coal-plants grew
upon the same land which supplied materials for the sandstones and
conglomerates of the strata in which they are imbedded. The coarseness
of the particles of many of these rocks attests that they were not
borne from very remote localities, and that there was land therefore in
the vicinity wasting away by the action of moving waters. The progress
also of modern discovery has led to the very general admission of
the doctrine that beds of coal have for the most part been formed of
the remains of trees and plants that grew on the spot where the coal
now exists; the land having been successively submerged, so that a
covering of mud and sand was deposited upon accumulations of
vegetable mater. That such has been the origin of some coal-seams
is proved by the upright position of fossil trees, both in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>Europe and America, in which the roots terminate downwards in beds
of coal.<a name="FNanchor_164" id="FNanchor_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>To return, therefore, from this digression,&mdash;the flora of the coal appears
to indicate a uniform and mild temperature in the air, while the
fossils of the contemporaneous mountain-limestone, comprising abundance
of lamelliferous corals, large chambered cephalopods, and crinoidea,
naturally lead us to infer a considerable warmth in the waters of the
northern sea of the Carboniferous period. So also in regard to strata
older than the coal, they contain in high northern latitudes mountain
masses of corals which must have lived and grown on the spot, and large
chambered univalves, such as Orthocerata and Nautilus, all seeming to
indicate, even in regions bordering on the arctic circle, the former prevalence
of a temperature more elevated than that now prevailing.</p>

<p>The warmth and humidity of the air, and the uniformity of climate,
both in the different seasons of the year, and in different latitudes, appears
to have been most remarkable when some of the oldest of the fossiliferous
strata were formed. The approximation to a climate similar to
that now enjoyed in these latitudes does not commence till the era of the
formations termed tertiary; and while the different tertiary rocks were
deposited in succession, from the eocene to the pliocene, the temperature
seems to have been lowered, and to have continued to diminish even after
the appearance upon the earth of a considerable number of the existing
species, the cold reaching its maximum of intensity in European latitudes
during the glacial epoch, or the epoch immediately antecedent to that in
which all the species now contemporary with man were in being.</p>

OF THE ANCIENT AND MODERN CAUSES OF CHANGE.</h6>

<p><i>Causes of Vicissitudes in Climate.</i><a name="FNanchor_165" id="FNanchor_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>&mdash;As the proofs enumerated in the
last chapter indicate that the earth's surface has experienced great changes
of climate since the deposition of the older sedimentary strata, we have
next to inquire how such vicissitudes can be reconciled with the existing
order of nature. The cosmogonist has availed himself of this, as of every
obscure problem in geology, to confirm his views concerning a period
when the planet was in a nascent or half-formed state, or when the laws
of the animate and inanimate world differed essentially from those now
established; and he has in this, as in many other cases, succeeded so far,
as to divert attention from that class of facts which, if fully understood,
might probably lead to an explanation of the phenomena. At first it was
imagined that the earth's axis had been for ages perpendicular to the
plane of the ecliptic, so that there was a perpetual equinox, and uniformity
of seasons throughout the year;&mdash;that the planet enjoyed this
"paradisiacal" state until the era of the great flood; but in that catastrophe,
whether by the shock of a comet, or some other convulsion, it
lost its equal poise, and hence the obliquity of its axis, and with that the
varied seasons of the temperate zone, and the long nights and days of
the polar circles.</p>

<p>When the progress of astronomical science had exploded this theory,
it was assumed, that the earth at its creation was in a state of fluidity,
and red-hot, and that ever since that era, it had been cooling down, contracting
its dimensions, and acquiring a solid crust,&mdash;an hypothesis hardly
less arbitrary, yet more calculated for lasting popularity; because, by referring
the mind directly to the beginning of things, it requires no support
from observation, nor from any ulterior hypothesis. But if, instead
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>of forming vague conjectures as to what might have been the state of
the planet at the era of its creation, we fix our thoughts on the connection
at present existing between climate and the distribution of land and sea;
and then consider what influence former fluctuations in the physical
geography of the earth must have had on superficial temperature, we may
perhaps approximate to a true theory. If doubts and obscurities still
remain, they should be ascribed to our limited acquaintance with the
laws of Nature, not to revolutions in her economy;&mdash;they should stimulate
us to farther research, not tempt us to indulge our fancies respecting
the imaginary changes of internal temperature in an embryo world.</p>

<p><i>Diffusion of Heat over the Globe.</i>&mdash;In considering the laws which regulate
the diffusion of heat over the globe, we must be careful, as Humboldt
well remarks, not to regard the climate of Europe as a type of the
temperature which all countries placed under the same latitude enjoy.
The physical sciences, observes this philosopher, always bear the impress
of the places where they began to be cultivated; and as, in geology, an
attempt was at first made to refer all the volcanic phenomena to those
of the volcanoes in Italy, so in meteorology, a small part of the old world,
the centre of the primitive civilization of Europe, was for a long time
considered a type to which the climate of all corresponding latitudes
might be referred. But this region, constituting only one-seventh of the
whole globe, proved eventually to be the exception to the general rule.
For the same reason, we may warn the geologist to be on his guard, and
not hastily to assume that the temperature of the earth in the present
era is a type of that which most usually obtains, since he contemplates
far mightier alterations in the position of land and sea, at different epochs,
than those which now cause the climate of Europe to differ from that of
other countries in the same parallels.</p>

<p>It is now well ascertained that zones of equal warmth, both in the
atmosphere and in the waters of the ocean, are neither parallel to the
equator nor to each other.<a name="FNanchor_166" id="FNanchor_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> It is also known that the <i>mean</i> annual
temperature may be the same in two places which enjoy very different
climates, for the seasons may be nearly uniform, or violently contrasted,
so that the lines of equal winter temperature do not coincide with those
of equal annual heat or isothermal lines. The deviations of all these
lines from the same parallel of latitude are determined by a multitude
of circumstances, among the principal of which are the position, direc<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>tion,
and elevation of the continents and islands, the position and depths
of the sea, and the direction of currents and of winds.</p>

<p>On comparing the two continents of Europe and America, it is found
that places in the same latitudes have sometimes a mean difference of
temperature amounting to 11&deg;, or even in a few cases to 17&deg; Fahr.; and
some places on the two continents, which have the same mean temperature,
differ from 7&deg; to 17&deg; in latitude. Thus, Cumberland House, in
North America, having the same latitude (54&deg; N.) as the city of York
in England, stands on the isothermal line of 32&deg;, which in Europe rises
to the North Cape, in lat. 71&deg;, but its summer heat exceeds that of
Brussels or Paris.<a name="FNanchor_167" id="FNanchor_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> The principal cause of greater intensity of cold in
corresponding latitudes of North America, as contrasted with Europe,
is the connection of America with the polar circle, by a large tract of
land, some of which is from three to five thousand feet in height; and,
on the other hand, the separation of Europe from the arctic circle by an
ocean. The ocean has a tendency to preserve everywhere a mean temperature,
which it communicates to the contiguous land, so that it tempers
the climate, moderating alike an excess of heat or cold. The elevated
land, on the other hand, rising to the colder regions of the atmosphere,
becomes a great reservoir of ice and snow, arrests, condenses,
and congeals vapor, and communicates its cold to the adjoining country.
For this reason, Greenland, forming part of a continent which stretches
northward to the 82d degree of latitude, experiences under the 60th
parallel a more rigorous climate than Lapland under the 72d parallel.</p>

<p>But if land be situated between the 40th parallel and the equator, it
produces, unless it be of extreme height, exactly the opposite effect;
for it then warms the tracts of land or sea that intervene between it and
the polar circle. For the surface being in this case exposed to the vertical,
or nearly vertical rays of the sun, absorbs a large quantity of heat,
which it diffuses by radiation into the atmosphere. For this reason, the
western parts of the old continent derive warmth from Africa, "which,
like an immense furnace, distributes its heat to Arabia, to Turkey in
Asia, and to Europe."<a name="FNanchor_168" id="FNanchor_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> On the contrary, the northeastern extremity
of Asia experiences in the same latitude extreme cold; for it has land
on the north between the 60th and 70th parallel, while to the south it
is separated from the equator by the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>In consequence of the more equal temperature of the waters of the
ocean, the climate of islands and of coasts differs essentially from that
of the interior of continents, the more maritime climate being characterized
by mild winters, and more temperate summers; for the sea-breezes
moderate the cold of winter, as well as the heat of summer. When,
therefore, we trace round the globe those belts in which the mean annual
temperature is the same, we often find great differences in climate; for
there are <i>insular</i> climates in which the seasons are nearly equalized, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span><i>excessive</i> climates, as they have been termed, where the temperature of
winter and summer is strongly contrasted. The whole of Europe, compared
with the eastern parts of America and Asia, has an insular climate.
The northern part of China, and the Atlantic region of the United States,
exhibit "excessive climates." We find at New York, says Humboldt,
the summer of Rome and the winter of Copenhagen; at Quebec, the
summer of Paris and the winter of Petersburg. At Pekin, in China,
where the mean temperature of the year is that of the coasts of Brittany,
the scorching heats of summer are greater than at Cairo, and the winters
as rigorous as at Upsala.<a name="FNanchor_169" id="FNanchor_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<p>If lines be drawn round the globe through all those places which
have the same winter temperature, they are found to deviate from the
terrestrial parallels much farther than the lines of equal mean annual
heat. The lines of equal winter in Europe, for example, are often
curved so as to reach parallels of latitude 9&deg; or 10&deg; distant from each
other, whereas the isothermal lines, or those passing through places
having the same mean annual temperature, differ only from 4&deg; to 5&deg;
in Europe.</p>

<p><i>Influence of currents and drift ice on temperature.</i>&mdash;Among other influential
causes, both of remarkable diversity in the mean annual heat,
and of unequal division of heat in the different seasons, are the direction
of currents and the accumulation and drifting of ice in high latitudes.
The temperature of the Lagullas current is 10&deg; or 12&deg; Fahr.
above that of the sea at the Cape of Good Hope; for it derives the
greater part of its waters from the Mozambique channel, and southeast
coast of Africa, and from regions in the Indian Ocean much nearer
the line, and much hotter than the Cape.<a name="FNanchor_170" id="FNanchor_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> An opposite effect is produced
by the "equatorial" current, which crosses the Atlantic from
Africa to Brazil, having a breadth varying from 160 to 450 nautical
miles. Its waters are cooler by 3&deg; or 4&deg; Fahr. than those of the ocean
under the line, so that it moderates the heat of the tropics.<a name="FNanchor_171" id="FNanchor_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>But the effects of the Gulf stream on the climate of the North Atlantic
Ocean are far more remarkable. This most powerful of known
currents has its source in the Gulf or Sea of Mexico, which, like the
Mediterranean and other close seas in temperate or low latitudes, is
warmer than the open ocean in the same parallels. The temperature
of the Mexican sea in summer is, according to Rennell, 86&deg; Fahr., or at
least 7&deg; above that of the Atlantic in the same latitude.<a name="FNanchor_172" id="FNanchor_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> From this
great reservoir or caldron of warm water, a constant current pours
forth through the straits of Bahama at the rate of 3 or 4 miles an hour;
it crosses the ocean in a northeasterly direction, skirting the great
bank of Newfoundland, where it still retains a temperature of 8&deg; above
that of the surrounding sea. It reaches the Azores in about 78 days,
after flowing nearly 3000 geographical miles, and from thence it some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>times
extends its course a thousand miles farther, so as to reach the
Bay of Biscay, still retaining an excess of 5&deg; above the mean temperature
of that sea. As it has been known to arrive there in the months
of November and January, it may tend greatly to moderate the cold
of winter in countries on the west of Europe.
.
There is a large tract in the centre of the North Atlantic, between
the parallels of 33&deg; and 45&deg; N. lat., which Rennell calls the "recipient
of the gulf water." A great part of it is covered by the weed called
sargasso (<i>Sargassum bacciferum</i>), which the current floats in abundance
from the Gulf of Mexico. This mass of water is nearly stagnant, is
warmer by 7&deg; or 10&deg; than the waters of the Atlantic, and may be compared
to the fresh water of a river overflowing the heavier salt water
of the sea. Rennell estimates the area of the "recipient," together
with that covered by the main current, as being 2000 miles in length
from E. to W., and 350 in breadth from N. to S., which, he remarks,
is a larger area than that of the Mediterranean. The heat of this great
body of water is kept up by the incessant and quick arrivals of fresh
supplies of warm water from the south; and there can be no doubt
that the general climate of parts of Europe and America is materially
affected by this cause.</p>

<p>It is considered probable by Scoresby that the influence of the Gulf
stream extends even to the sea near Spitzbergen, where its waters may
pass under those of melted ice; for it has been found that in the neighborhood
of Spitzbergen, the water is warmer by 6&deg; or 7&deg; at the depth
of one hundred and two hundred fathoms than at the surface. This
might arise from the known law that fresh water passes the point of
greatest density when cooled down below 40&deg;, and between that and
the freezing point expands again. The water of melted ice might be
lighter, both as being fresh (having lost its salt in the decomposing
process of freezing), and because its temperature is nearer the freezing
point than the inferior water of the Gulf stream.</p>

<p>The great glaciers generated in the valleys of Spitzbergen, in the 79&deg;
of north latitude, are almost all cut off at the beach, being melted by
the feeble remnant of heat still retained by the Gulf stream. In
Baffin's Bay, on the contrary, on the west coast of Old Greenland,
where the temperature of the sea is not mitigated by the same cause,
and where there is no warmer under-current, the glaciers stretch out
from the shore, and furnish repeated crops of mountainous masses of
ice which float off into the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_173" id="FNanchor_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> The number and dimensions of
these bergs is prodigious. Captain Sir John Ross saw several of them
together in Baffin's Bay aground in water fifteen hundred feet deep!
Many of them are driven down into Hudson's Bay, and accumulating
there, diffuse excessive cold over the neighboring continent; so that
Captain Franklin reports, that at the mouth of Hayes' River, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>lies in the same latitude as the north of Prussia or the south of Scotland,
ice is found everywhere in digging wells, in summer, at the depth
of four feet! Other bergs have been occasionally met with, at midsummer,
in a state of rapid thaw, as far south as lat. 40&deg; and longitude
about 60&deg; west, where they cool the water sensibly to the distance of
forty or fifty miles around, the thermometer sinking sometimes 17&deg;, or
even 18&deg;, Fahrenheit, in their neighborhood.<a name="FNanchor_174" id="FNanchor_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> It is a well-known fact
that every four or five years a large number of icebergs, floating from
Greenland, double Cape Langaness, and are stranded on the west coast
of Iceland. The inhabitants are then aware that their crops of hay
will fail, in consequence of fogs which are generated almost incessantly;
and the dearth of food is not confined to the land, for the temperature
of the water is so changed that the fish entirely desert the coast.</p>

<p><i>Difference of climate of the Northern and Southern hemispheres.</i>&mdash;When
we compare the climate of the northern and southern hemispheres,
we obtain still more instruction in regard to the influence of the distribution
of land and sea on climate. The dry land in the southern hemisphere
is to that of the northern in the ratio only of one to three, excluding
from our consideration that part which lies between the pole and
the 78&deg; of south latitude, which has hitherto proved inaccessible. And
whereas in the northern hemisphere, between the pole and the thirtieth
parallel of north latitude, the land and sea occupy nearly equal areas,
the ocean in the southern hemisphere covers no less than fifteen parts
in sixteen of the entire space included between the antarctic circle and
the thirtieth parallel of south latitude.</p>

<p>This great extent of sea gives a particular character to climates south
of the equator, the winters being mild and the summers cool. Thus, in
Van Dieman's Land, corresponding nearly in latitude to Rome, the
winters are more mild than at Naples, and the summers not warmer than
those at Paris, which is 7&deg; farther from the equator.<a name="FNanchor_175" id="FNanchor_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> The effects on
animal and vegetable life are remarkable. Capt. King observed large
shrubs of Fuchsia and Veronica, which in England are treated as tender
plants, thriving and in full flower in Tierra del Fuego with the temperature
at 36&deg;. He states also that humming birds were seen sipping the
sweets of the flowers "after two or three days of constant rain, snow,
and sleet, during which time the thermometer had been at the freezing
point." Mr. Darwin also saw parrots feeding on the seeds of a tree
called the winter's bark, south of lat. 55&deg;, near Cape Horn.<a name="FNanchor_176" id="FNanchor_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a></p>

<p>So the orchideous plants which are parasitical on trees, and are generally
characteristic of the tropics, advance to the 38th and 42d degree
of S. lat., and even beyond the 45th degree in New Zealand, where
they were found by Forster. In South America also arborescent grasses
abound in the dense forests of Chiloe, in lat. 42&deg; S., where "they entwine
the trees into one entangled mass to the height of thirty or forty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>feet above the ground. Palm-trees in the same quarter of the globe
grow in lat. 37&deg;, an arborescent grass very like a bamboo in 40&deg;, and
another closely allied kind, of great length, but not erect, even as far
south as 45&deg;."<a name="FNanchor_177" id="FNanchor_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>It has long been supposed that the general temperature of the southern
hemisphere was considerably lower than that of the northern, and that
the difference amounted to at least 10&deg; Fahrenheit. Baron Humboldt,
after collecting and comparing a great number of observations, came to
the conclusion that even a much larger difference existed, but that none
was to be observed within the tropics, and only a small difference as far
as the thirty-fifth and fortieth parallel. Captain Cook was of opinion
that the ice of the antarctic predominated greatly over that of the arctic
region, that encircling the southern pole coming nearer to the equator
by 10&deg; than the ice around the north pole. All the recent voyages of
discovery have tended to confirm this opinion, although Capt. Weddel
penetrated, in 1823, three degrees farther south than Capt. Cook, reaching
lat. 74&deg; 15' South, long. 34&deg; 17' West, and Sir James Ross, in 1842,
arrived at lat. 78&deg; 10' S., as high a latitude, within three degrees, as
the farthest point attained by Captain Parry in the arctic circle, or lat.
81&deg; 12' North.</p>

<p>The description given by ancient as well as modern navigators of the
sea and land in high southern latitudes, clearly attests the greater severity
of the climate as compared to arctic regions. In Sandwich Land,
in lat. 59&deg; S., or in nearly the same parallel as the north of Scotland,
Capt. Cook found the whole country, from the summits of the mountains
down to the very brink of the sea-cliffs, "covered many fathoms thick
with everlasting snow," and this on the 1st of February, the hottest time
of the year; and what is still more astonishing, in the island of S. Georgia,
which is in the 54&deg; south latitude, or the same parallel as Yorkshire, the
line of perpetual snow descends to the level of the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_178" id="FNanchor_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> When we
consider this fact, and then recollect that the highest mountains in Scotland,
which ascend to an elevation of nearly 5000 feet, and are four degrees
farther to the north, do not attain the limit of perpetual snow on
our side of the equator, we learn that latitude is one only of many powerful
causes, which determine the climate of particular regions of the
globe. Capt. Sir James Ross, in his exploring expedition in 1841-3,
found that the temperature south of the 60th degree of latitude seldom
rose above 32&deg; Fahr. During the two summer months of the year 1841
(January and February) the range of the thermometer was between 11&deg;
and 32&deg; Fahr.; and scarcely once rose above the freezing point. The
permanence of snow in the southern hemisphere, is in this instance partly
due to the floating ice, which chills the atmosphere and condenses the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>vapor, so that in summer the sun cannot pierce through the foggy air.
But besides the abundance of ice which covers the sea to the south of
Georgia and Sandwich Land, we may also, as Humboldt suggests, ascribe
the cold of those countries in part to the absence of land between
them and the tropics.</p>

<p>If Africa and New Holland extended farther to the south, a diminution
of ice would take place in consequence of the radiation of heat from
these continents during summer, which would warm the contiguous sea
and rarefy the air. The heated aerial currents would then ascend and
flow more rapidly towards the south pole, and moderate the winter.
In confirmation of these views, it is stated that the ice, which extends as
far as the 68&deg; and 71&deg; of south latitude, advances more towards the
equator whenever it meets an open sea; that is, where the extremities
of the present continents are not opposite to it; and this circumstance
seems explicable only on the principle above alluded to, of the radiation
of heat from the lands so situated.</p>

<p>The cold of the antarctic regions was conjectured by Cook to be due
to the existence of a large tract of land between the seventieth degree
of south latitude and the pole. The justness of these and other speculations
of that great navigator have since been singularly confirmed by
the investigation made by Sir James Ross in 1841. He found Victoria
Land, extending from 71&deg; to 79&deg; S. latitude, skirted by a great barrier
of ice, the height of the land ranging from 4000 to 14,000 feet,
the whole entirely covered with snow, except a narrow ring of black
earth surrounding the huge crater of the active volcano of Mount
Erebus, rising 12,400 feet above the level of the sea. The position of
a mountainous territory of such altitude, so near the pole, and so obvious
a source of intense cold, fully explains why Graham's and Enderby's
Land, discovered by Captain Biscoe in 1831-2 (between lat. 64&deg; and
68&deg; S.), presented a most wintry aspect, covered even in summer with
ice and snow, and nearly destitute of animal life. In corresponding
latitudes of the northern hemisphere we not only meet with herds of
wild herbivorous animals, but with land which man himself inhabits,
and where he has even built ports and inland villages.<a name="FNanchor_179" id="FNanchor_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a></p>

<p>The distance to which icebergs float from the polar regions on the
opposite sides of the line is, as might have been anticipated, very different.
Their extreme limit in the northern hemisphere is lat. 40&deg;, as
before mentioned, and they are occasionally seen in lat. 42&deg; N., near
the termination of the great bank of Newfoundland, and at the Azores,
lat. 42&deg; N., to which they are sometimes drifted from Baffin's Bay.
But in the other hemisphere they have been seen, within the last few
years, at different points off the Cape of Good Hope, between lat.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>36&deg; and 39&deg;.<a name="FNanchor_180" id="FNanchor_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> One of these (see <a href="#f2">fig. 2</a>.) was two miles in circumference,
and 150 feet high, appearing like chalk when the sun was obscured,
and having the lustre of refined sugar when the sun was shining
on it. Others rose from 250 to 300 feet above the level of the sea, and
were therefore of great volume below; since it is ascertained by experiments
on the buoyancy of ice floating in sea-water, that for every cubic
foot seen above, there must at least be eight cubic feet below water.<a name="FNanchor_181" id="FNanchor_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>
If ice islands from the north polar regions floated as far, they might
reach Cape St. Vincent, and there, being drawn by the current that
always sets in from the Atlantic through the Straits of Gibraltar, be
drifted into the Mediterranean, so that the serene sky of that delightful
region might soon be deformed by clouds and mists.</p>

<p>Before the amount of difference between the temperature of the two
hemispheres was ascertained, it was referred by many astronomers to
the precession of the equinoxes, or the acceleration of the earth's motion
in its perihelium; in consequence of which the spring and summer
of the southern hemisphere are now shorter, by nearly eight days, than
those seasons north of the equator. But Sir J. Herschel reminds us
that the excess of eight days in the duration of the sun's presence in
the northern hemisphere is not productive of an excess of annual light
and heat; since, according to the laws of elliptic motion, it is demonstrable
that whatever be the ellipticity of the earth's orbit, the two
hemispheres must receive <i>equal absolute quantities</i> of light and heat
per annum, the proximity of the sun in perigee exactly compensating
the effect of its swifter motion.<a name="FNanchor_182" id="FNanchor_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> Humboldt, however, observes, that
there must be a greater loss of heat by radiation in the southern hemi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>sphere
during a winter longer by eight days than that on the other side
of the equator.<a name="FNanchor_183" id="FNanchor_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<p>Perhaps no very sensible effect may be produced by this source of
disturbance; yet the geologist should bear in mind that to a certain
extent it operates alternately on each of the two hemispheres for a
period of upwards of 10,000 years, dividing unequally the times during
which the annual supply of solar light and heat is received. This
cause may sometimes tend to counterbalance inequalities of temperature
resulting from other far more influential circumstances; but, on the
other hand, it must sometimes tend to increase the extreme of deviation
arising from particular combinations of causes.</p>

<p>But whatever may be at present the inferiority of heat in the temperate
and frigid zones south of the line, it is quite evident that the cold
would be far more intense if there happened, instead of open sea, to be
tracts of elevated land between the 55th and 70th parallel; and, on the
other hand, the cold would be moderated if there were more land between
the line and the forty-fifth degree of south latitude.</p>

<p><i>Changes in the position of land and sea may give rise to vicissitudes
in climate.</i>&mdash;Having offered these brief remarks on the diffusion of heat
over the globe in the present state of the surface, I shall now proceed
to speculate on the vicissitudes of climate, which must attend those
endless variations in the geographical features of our planet which are
contemplated in geology. That our speculations may be confined within
the strict limits of analogy, I shall assume, 1st, That the proportion
of dry land to sea continues always the same. 2dly, That the volume
of the land rising above the level of the sea is a constant quantity; and
not only that its mean, but that its extreme height, is liable only to
trifling variations. 3dly, That both the mean and extreme depth of
the sea are invariable; and 4thly, It may be consistent with due caution
to assume that the grouping together of the land in continents is a
necessary part of the economy of nature; for it is possible that the
laws which govern the subterranean forces, and which act simultaneously
along certain lines, cannot but produce, at every epoch, continuous
mountain-chains; so that the subdivision of the whole land into
innumerable islands may be precluded.</p>

<p>If it be objected, that the maximum of elevation of land and depth
of sea are probably not constant, nor the gathering together of all the
land in certain parts, nor even perhaps the relative extent of land
and water, I reply, that the arguments about to be adduced will be
strengthened if, in these peculiarities of the surface, there be considerable
deviations from the present type. If, for example, all other circumstances
being the same, the land is at one time more divided into
islands than at another, a greater uniformity of climate might be produced,
the mean temperature remaining unaltered; or if, at another era,
there were mountains higher than the Himalaya, these, when placed in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>high latitudes, would cause a greater excess of cold. Or, if we suppose
that at certain periods no chain of hills in the world rose beyond the
height of 10,000 feet, a greater heat might then have prevailed than is
compatible with the existence of mountains thrice that elevation.</p>

<p>However constant may be the relative proportion of sea and land, we
know that there is annually some small variation in their respective
geographical positions, and that in every century the land is in some
parts raised, and in others depressed in level, and so likewise is the bed
of the sea. By these and other ceaseless changes, the configuration of
the earth's surface has been remodelled again and again, since it was
the habitation of organic beings, and the bed of the ocean has been
lifted up to the height of some of the loftiest mountains. The imagination
is apt to take alarm when called upon to admit the formation of
such irregularities in the crust of the earth, after it had once become
the habitation of living creatures; but, if time be allowed, the operation
need not subvert the ordinary repose of nature; and the result is
in a general view insignificant, if we consider how slightly the highest
mountain-chains cause our globe to differ from a perfect sphere.
Chimborazo, though it rises to more than 21,000 feet above the sea,
would be represented, on a globe of about six feet in diameter, by a
grain of sand less than one-twentieth of an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>The superficial inequalities of the earth, then, may be deemed minute
in quantity, and their distribution at any particular epoch must be regarded
in geology as temporary peculiarities, like the height and outline
of the cone of Vesuvius in the interval between two eruptions.
But although, in reference to the magnitude of the globe, the unevenness
of the surface is so unimportant, it is on the position and direction
of these small inequalities that the state of the atmosphere, and both
the local and general climate, are mainly dependent.</p>

<p>Before considering the effect which a material change in the distribution
of land and sea must occasion, it may be well to remark, how
greatly organic life may be affected by those minor variations, which
need not in the least degree alter the general temperature. Thus, for
example, if we suppose, by a series of convulsions, a certain part of
Greenland to become sea, and, in compensation, a tract of land to rise
and connect Spitzbergen with Lapland,&mdash;an accession not greater in
amount than one which the geologist can prove to have occurred in certain
districts bordering the Mediterranean, within a comparatively modern
period,&mdash;this altered form of the land might cause an interchange
between the climate of certain parts of North America and of Europe,
which lie in corresponding latitudes. Many European species of plants
and animals would probably perish in consequence, because the mean
temperature would be greatly lowered; and others would fail in America,
because it would there be raised. On the other hand, in places
where the mean annual heat remained unaltered, some species which
flourish in Europe, where the seasons are more uniform, would be unable
to resist the greater heat of the North American summer, or the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
intenser cold of the winter; while others, now fitted by their habits for
the great contrast of the American seasons, would not be fitted for the
<i>insular</i> climate of Europe. The vine, for example, according to Humboldt,
can be cultivated with advantage 10&deg; farther north in Europe
than in North America. Many plants endure severe frost, but cannot
ripen their seeds without a certain intensity of summer heat and a certain
quantity of light; others cannot endure a similar intensity either of
heat or cold.</p>

<p>It is now established that many of the existing species of animals
have survived great changes in the physical geography of the globe. If
such species be termed modern, in comparison to races which preceded
them, their remains, nevertheless, enter into submarine deposits many
hundred miles in length, and which have since been raised from the deep
to no inconsiderable altitude. When, therefore, it is shown that changes
in the temperature of the atmosphere may be the consequence of such
physical revolutions of the surface, we ought no longer to wonder that
we find the distribution of existing species to be <i>local</i>, in regard to <i>longitude</i>
as well as latitude. If all species were now, by an exertion of
creative power, to be diffused uniformly throughout those zones where
there is an equal degree of heat, and in all respects a similarity of climate,
they would begin from this moment to depart more and more from
their original distribution. Aquatic and terrestrial species would be displaced,
as Hooke long ago observed, so often as land and water exchanged
places; and there would also, by the formation of new mountains and
other changes, be transpositions of climate, contributing, in the manner
before alluded to, to the local extermination of species.<a name="FNanchor_184" id="FNanchor_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>If we now proceed to consider the circumstances required for a <i>general</i>
change of temperature, it will appear, from the facts and principles
already laid down, that whenever a greater extent of high land is collected
in the polar regions, the cold will augment; and the same result
will be produced when there is more sea between or near the tropics;
while, on the contrary, so often as the above conditions are reversed,
the heat will be greater. (See figs. <a href="#f5">5</a> and <a href="#f6">6</a>, p. 111.) If this be admitted,
it will follow, that unless the superficial inequalities of the earth be
fixed and permanent, there must be never-ending fluctuations in the mean
temperature of every zone; and that the climate of one era can no more
be a type of every other; than is one of our four seasons of all the rest.</p>

<p>It has been well said, that the earth is covered by an ocean, in the
midst of which are two great islands, and many smaller ones; for the
whole of the continents and islands occupy an area scarcely exceeding
one-fourth of the whole superficies of the spheroid. Now, according to
this analogy, we may fairly speculate on the probability that there would
not be usually, at any given epoch of the past, more than about one-fourth
dry land in a particular region; as, for example, near the poles,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
or between them and the 75th parallels of N. and S. latitude. If, therefore,
at present there should happen to be, in both these quarters of the
globe, much <i>more</i> than this average proportion of land, some of it in the
arctic region, being above, five thousand feet in height, and if in antarctic
latitudes a mountainous country has been found varying from 4000 to
14,000 feet in height, this alone affords ground for concluding that, in
the present state of things, the mean heat of the climate is below that
which the earth's surface, in its more ordinary state, would enjoy. This
presumption is heightened when we reflect on the results of the recent
soundings made by Sir James Ross, in the Southern Ocean, and continued
for four successive years, ending 1844, which seem to prove that
the mean depth of the Atlantic and Pacific is as great as Laplace and
other eminent astronomers had imagined;<a name="FNanchor_185" id="FNanchor_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> for then we might look not
only for more than two-thirds sea in the frigid zones, but for water of
great depth, which could not readily be reduced to the freezing point.
The same opinion is confirmed, when we compare the quantity of land
lying between the poles and the 30th parallels of north and south latitude,
with the quantity placed between those parallels and the equator;
for, it is clear, that we have at present not only more than the usual degree
of cold in the polar regions, but also less than the average quantity
of heat within the tropics.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span><i>Position of land and sea which might produce the extreme of cold of
which the earth's surface is susceptible.</i>&mdash;To simplify our view of the
various changes in climate, which different combinations of geographical
circumstances may produce, we shall first consider the conditions necessary
for bringing about the extreme of cold, or what would have been
termed in the language of the old writers the winter of the "great
year," or geological cycle, and afterwards, the conditions requisite to
produce the maximum of heat, or the summer of the same year.</p>

<p>To begin with the northern hemisphere. Let us suppose those hills
of the Italian peninsula and of Sicily, which are of comparatively modern
origin, and contain many fossil shells identical with living species, to
subside again into the sea, from which they have been raised, and that an
extent of land of equal area and height (varying from one to three
thousand feet) should rise up in the Arctic Ocean between Siberia and
the north pole. In speaking of such changes, I shall not allude to the
manner in which I conceive it possible that they may be brought about,
nor of the time required for their accomplishment&mdash;reserving for a future
occasion, not only the proofs that revolutions of equal magnitude have
taken place, but that analogous operations are still in gradual progress.
The alteration now supposed in the physical geography of the northern
regions, would cause additional snow and ice to accumulate where now
there is usually an open sea; and the temperature of the greater part
of Europe would be somewhat lowered, so as to resemble more nearly
that of corresponding latitudes of North America: or, in other words,
it might be necessary to travel about 10&deg; farther south in order to meet
with the same climate which we now enjoy. No compensation would
be derived from the disappearance of land in the Mediterranean countries;
but the contrary, since the mean heat of the soil in those latitudes
probably exceeds that which would belong to the sea, by which
we imagine it to be replaced.</p>

<p>But let the configuration of the surface be still farther varied, and let
some large district within or near the tropics, such as Brazil, with its
plains and hills of moderate height, be converted into sea, while lands
of equal elevation and extent rise up in the arctic circle. From this
change there would, in the first place, result a sensible diminution of
temperature near the tropic, for the Brazilian soil would no longer be
heated by the sun; so that the atmosphere would be less warm, as also
the neighboring Atlantic. On the other hand, the whole of Europe,
Northern Asia, and North America, would be chilled by the enormous
quantity of ice and snow, thus generated on the new arctic continent.
If, as we have already seen, there are now some points in the southern
hemisphere where snow is perpetual down to the level of the sea, in
latitudes as low as central England, such might assuredly be the case
throughout a great part of Europe, under the change of circumstances
above supposed: and if at present the extreme range of drifted icebergs
is the Azores, they might easily reach the equator after the assumed
alteration. But to pursue the subject still farther, let the Himalaya<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
mountains, with the whole of Hindostan, sink down, and their place be
occupied by the Indian Ocean, while an equal extent of territory and
mountains, of the same vast height, rise up between North Greenland
and the Orkney Islands. It seems difficult to exaggerate the amount
to which the climate of the northern hemisphere would then be cooled.<a name="FNanchor_186" id="FNanchor_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>But the refrigeration brought about at the same time in the southern
hemisphere, would be nearly equal, and the difference of temperature
between the arctic and equatorial latitudes would not be much greater
than at present; for no important disturbance can occur in the climate
of a particular region without its immediately affecting all other latitudes,
however remote. The heat and cold which surround the globe
are in a state of constant and universal flux and reflux. The heated
and rarefied air is always rising and flowing from the equator towards
the poles in the higher regions of the atmosphere; while in the lower,
the colder air is flowing back to restore the equilibrium. That this circulation
is constantly going on in the aerial currents is not disputed; it
is often proved by the opposite course of the clouds at different heights,
and the fact has been farther illustrated in a striking manner by two
recent events. The trade wind continually blows with great force from
the island of Barbadoes to that of St. Vincent; notwithstanding which,
during the eruption of the volcano in the island of St. Vincent, in 1812,
ashes fell in profusion from a great height in the atmosphere upon
Barbadoes.<a name="FNanchor_187" id="FNanchor_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> In like manner, during the great eruption of Sumbawa,
in 1815, ashes were carried to the islands of Amboyna and Banda,
which last is about 800 miles east from the site of the volcano. Yet
the southeast monsoon was then at its height.<a name="FNanchor_188" id="FNanchor_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> This apparent transposition
of matter against the wind, confirmed the opinion of the existence
of a counter-current in the higher regions, which had previously
rested on theoretical conclusions only.</p>

<p>That a corresponding interchange takes place in the seas, is demonstrated,
according to Humboldt, by the cold which is found to exist at
great depths within the tropics; and, among other proofs, may be mentioned
the mass of warmer water which the Gulf stream is constantly
bearing northwards, while a cooler current flows <i>from</i> the north along
the coast of Greenland and Labrador, and helps to restore the equilibrium.<a name="FNanchor_189" id="FNanchor_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>Currents of colder and therefore specifically heavier water pass from
the poles towards the equator, which cool the inferior parts of the
ocean; so that the heat of the torrid zone and the cold of the polar
circle balance each other. The refrigeration, therefore, of the polar regions,
resulting from the supposed alteration in the distribution of land
and sea, would be immediately communicated to the tropics, and from
them its influence would extend to the antarctic circle, where the atmosphere
and the ocean would be cooled, so that ice and snow would augment.
Although the mean temperature of higher latitudes in the
southern hemisphere is, as before stated, for the most part, lower than
that of the same parallels in the northern, yet, for a considerable space
on each side of the line, the mean annual heat of the waters is found
to be the same in corresponding parallels. If, therefore, by the new
position of the land, the formation of icebergs had become of common
occurrence in the northern temperate zone, and if these were frequently
drifted as far as the equator, the same degree of cold which they generated
would immediately be communicated as far as the tropic of Capricorn,
and from thence to the lands or ocean to the south.</p>

<p>The freedom, then, of the circulation of heat and cold from pole to
pole being duly considered, it will be evident that the mean temperature
which may prevail at the same point at two distinct periods, may
differ far more widely than that of any two points in the same parallels
of latitude, at one and the same period. For the range of temperature,
or in other words, the curvature of the isothermal lines in a given zone,
and at a given period, must always be circumscribed within narrow
limits, the climate of each place in that zone being controlled by the
combined influence of the geographical peculiarities of all other parts
of the earth. Whereas, if we compare the state of things at two distinct
and somewhat distant epochs, a particular zone may at one time
be under the influence of one class of disturbing causes, and at another
time may be affected by an opposite combination. The lands, for example,
to the north of Greenland cause the present climate of North
America to be colder than that of Europe in the same latitudes; but
the excess of cold is not so great as it would have been if the western
hemisphere had been entirely isolated, or separated from the eastern
like a distinct planet. For not only does the refrigeration produced by
Greenland chill to a certain extent the atmosphere of northern and western
Europe, but the mild climate of Europe reacts also upon North America,
and moderates the chilling influence of the adjoining polar lands.</p>

<p>To return to the state of the earth after the changes above supposed,
we must not omit to dwell on the important effects to which a wide
expanse of perpetual snow would give rise. It is probable that nearly
the whole sea, from the poles to the parallels of 45&deg;, would be frozen
over; for it is well known that the immediate proximity of land is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>essential to the formation and increase of field ice, provided there be in
some part of the same zone a sufficient quantity of glaciers generated
on or near the land, to cool down the sea. Captain Scoresby, in his
account of the arctic regions, observes, that when the sun's rays "fall
upon the snow-clad surface of the ice or land, they are in a great measure
reflected, without producing any material elevation of temperature;
but when they impinge on the black exterior of a ship, the pitch on
one side occasionally becomes fluid while ice is rapidly generated at
the other."<a name="FNanchor_190" id="FNanchor_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>Now field ice is almost always covered with snow;<a name="FNanchor_191" id="FNanchor_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> and thus not
only land as extensive as our existing continents, but immense tracts of
sea in the frigid and temperate zones, might present a solid surface
covered with snow, and reflecting the sun's rays for the greater part of
the year. Within the tropics, moreover, where the ocean now predominates,
the sky would no longer be serene and clear, as in the present
era; but masses of floating ice would cause quick condensations of
vapor, so that fogs and clouds would deprive the vertical rays of the
sun of half their power. The whole planet, therefore, would receive
annually a smaller portion of the solar influence, and the external crust
would part, by radiation, with some of the heat which had been accumulated
in it, during a different state of the surface. This heat would
be dissipated in the spaces surrounding our atmosphere, which, according
to the calculations of M. Fourier, have a temperature much inferior
to that of freezing water.</p>

<p>After the geographical revolution above assumed, the climate of
equinoctial lands might be brought at last to resemble that of the present
temperate zone, or perhaps be far more wintry. They who should
then inhabit such small isles and coral reefs as are now seen in the
Indian Ocean and South Pacific, would wonder that zoophytes of large
dimensions had once been so prolific in their seas; or if, perchance,
they found the wood and fruit of the cocoa-nut tree or the palm silicified
by the waters of some ancient mineral spring, or incrusted with
calcareous matter, they would muse on the revolutions which had annihilated
such genera, and replaced them by the oak, the chestnut, and
the pine. With equal admiration would they compare the skeletons of
their small lizards with the bones of fossil alligators and crocodiles more
than twenty feet in length, which, at a former epoch, had multiplied
between the tropics: and when they saw a pine included in an iceberg,
drifted from latitudes which we now call temperate, they would be astonished
at the proof thus afforded, that forests had once grown where
nothing could be seen in their own times but a wilderness of snow.</p>

<p>If the reader hesitate to suppose so extensive an alteration of temperature
as the probable consequence of geographical changes, confined to
one hemisphere, he should remember how great are the local anomalies
in climate now resulting from the peculiar distribution of land and sea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>in certain regions. Thus, in the island of South Georgia, before mentioned
(p. 98), Captain Cook found the everlasting snows descending
to the level of the sea, between lat. 54&deg; and 55&deg; S.; no trees or shrubs
were to be seen, and in summer a few rocks only, after a partial melting
of the ice and snow, were scantily covered with moss and tufts of
grass. If such a climate can now exist at the level of the sea in a latitude
corresponding to that of Yorkshire in spite of all those equalizing
causes before enumerated, by which the mixture of the temperatures of
distant regions is facilitated throughout the globe, what rigors might
we not anticipate in a winter generated by the transfer of the mountains
of India to our arctic circle!</p>

<p>But we have still to contemplate the additional refrigeration which
might be effected by changes in the relative position of land and sea in
the southern hemisphere. If the remaining continents were transferred
from the equatorial and contiguous latitudes to the south polar regions,
the intensity of cold produced might, perhaps, render the globe uninhabitable.
We are too ignorant of the laws governing the direction of
subterranean forces, to determine whether such a crisis be within the
limits of possibility. At the same time, it may be observed, that no
distribution of land can well be imagined more irregular, or, as it were,
capricious, than that which now prevails; for at present, the globe may
be divided into two equal parts, in such a manner, that one hemisphere
shall be almost entirely covered with water, while the other shall contain
less water than land (see figs. <a href="#f3">3</a> and <a href="#f4">4</a>);<a name="FNanchor_192" id="FNanchor_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> and, what is still more
extraordinary, on comparing the extratropical lands in the northern and
southern hemispheres, the lands in the northern are found to be to those
in the southern in the proportion of thirteen to one!<a name="FNanchor_193" id="FNanchor_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> To imagine all
the lands, therefore, in high, and all the sea in low latitudes, as delineated
in <a href="#f6">fig. 6</a>. p. 111, would scarcely be a more anomalous state of the
surface.</p>

<p class="small4"><span class="smcap">Observations.</span>&mdash;These maps are intended to show that continents and islands having the same
shape and relative dimensions as those now existing, might be placed so as to occupy either the
equatorial or polar regions.<br /><br /></p>

<p class="small4">In <a href="#f5">fig. 5</a>, scarcely any of the land extends from the equator towards the poles beyond the 30th
parallel of latitude; and <a href="#f6">fig. 6</a>, a very small proportion of it extends from the poles towards the
Equator beyond the 40th parallel of latitude.</p>

<p><i>Position of land and sea which might give rise to the extreme of heat.</i>&mdash;Let
us now turn from the contemplation of the winter of the "great year,"
and consider the opposite train of circumstances which would bring on
the spring and summer. To imagine all the lands to be collected together
in equatorial latitudes, and a few promontories only to project
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
beyond the thirtieth parallel, as represented in the annexed maps (figs.
<a href="#f5">5</a> and <a href="#f6">6</a>), would be undoubtedly to suppose an extreme result of geological
change. But if we consider a mere approximation to such a state
of things, it would be sufficient to cause a general elevation of temperature.
Nor can it be regarded as a visionary idea, that amidst the revolutions
of the earth's surface, the quantity of land should, at certain periods,
have been simultaneously lessened in the vicinity of both the poles,
and increased within the tropics. We must recollect that even now it
is necessary to ascend to the height of fifteen thousand feet in the Andes
under the line, and in the Himalaya mountains, which are without the tropic,
to seventeen thousand feet, before we reach the limit of perpetual snow.
On the northern slope, indeed, of the Himalaya range, where the heat radiated
from a great continent moderates the cold, there are meadows and
cultivated land at an elevation equal to the height of Mont
Blanc.<a name="FNanchor_194" id="FNanchor_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> If then
there were no arctic lands to chill the atmosphere, and freeze the sea, and
if the loftiest chains were near the line, it seems reasonable to imagine that
the highest mountains might be clothed with a rich vegetation to their
summits, and that nearly all signs of frost would disappear from the earth.</p>

<p>When the absorption of the solar rays was in no region impeded, even
in winter, by a coat of snow, the mean heat of the earth's crust would
augment to considerable depths, and springs, which we know to be in
general an index of the mean temperature of the climate, would be
warmer in all latitudes. The waters of lakes, therefore, and rivers,
would be much hotter in winter, and would be never chilled in summer
by melted snow and ice. A remarkable uniformity of climate would prevail
amid the archipelagoes of the temperate and polar oceans, where the
tepid waters of equatorial currents would freely circulate. The general humidity
of the atmosphere would far exceed that of the present period, for
increased heat would promote evaporation in all parts of the globe. The
winds would be first heated in their passage over the tropical plains, and
would then gather moisture from the surface of the deep, till, charged with
vapor, they arrived at extreme northern and southern regions, and there
encountering a cooler atmosphere, discharged their burden in warm rain.
If, during the long night of a polar winter, the snows should whiten the
summits of some arctic islands, they would be dissolved as rapidly by the
returning sun, as are the snows of Etna by the blasts of the sirocco.</p>

<p>We learn from those who have studied the geographical distribution of
plants, that in very low latitudes, at present, the vegetation of small islands remote
from continents has a peculiar character; the ferns and allied families,
in particular, bearing a great proportion to the total number of other plants.
Other circumstances being the same, the more remote the isles are from
the continents, the greater does this proportion become. Thus, in the continent
of India, and the tropical parts of New Holland, the proportion of
ferns to the ph&aelig;nogamous plants is only as one to twenty-six; whereas,
in the South-Sea Islands, it is as one to four, or even as one to three.<a name="FNanchor_195" id="FNanchor_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>We might expect, therefore, in the summer of the "great year," or
cycle of climate, that there would be a predominance of tree ferns and
plants allied to genera now called tropical, in the islands of the wide
ocean, while many forms now confined to arctic and temperate regions,
or only found near the equator on the summit of the loftiest mountains,
would almost disappear from the earth. Then might those genera of
animals return, of which the memorials are preserved in the ancient rocks
of our continents. The pterodactyle might flit again through the air,
the huge iguanodon reappear in the woods, and the ichthyosaurs swarm
once more in the sea. Coral reefs might be prolonged again beyond
the arctic circle, where the whale and the narwal now abound; and
droves of turtles might begin again to wander through regions now tenanted
by the walrus and the seal.</p>

<p>But not to indulge too far in these speculations, I may observe, in
conclusion, that however great, during the lapse of ages, may be the
vicissitudes of temperature in every zone, it accords with this theory that
the general climate should not experience any sensible change in the
course of a few thousand years; because that period is insufficient to
affect the leading features of the physical geography of the globe.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the apparent uncertainty of the seasons, it is found
that the mean temperature of particular localities is very constant, when
observations made for a sufficient series of years are compared.</p>

<p>Yet there must be exceptions to this rule; and even the labors of
man have, by the drainage of lakes and marshes, and the felling of extensive
forests, caused such changes in the atmosphere as greatly to raise
our conception of the more important influence of those forces to which,
in certain latitudes, even the existence of land or water, hill or valley,
lake or sea, must be ascribed. If we possessed accurate information of
the amount of <i>local</i> fluctuation in climate in the course of twenty centuries,
it would often, undoubtedly, be considerable. Certain tracts, for
example, on the coast of Holland and of England consisted of cultivated
land in the time of the Romans, which the sea, by gradual encroachments,
has at length occupied. Here, at least, a slight alteration has
been effected; for neither the distribution of heat in the different seasons,
nor the mean annual temperature of the atmosphere investing the sea, is
precisely the same as that which rests upon the land.</p>

<p>In those countries, also, where earthquakes and volcanoes are in full
activity, a much shorter period may produce a sensible variation. The
climate of the great table-land of Malpais in Mexico, must differ materially
from that which prevailed before the middle of the last century; for,
since that time, six mountains, the highest of them rising sixteen hundred
feet above the plateau, have been thrown up by volcanic eruptions.
It is by the repetition of an indefinite number of such local revolutions,
and by slow movements extending simultaneously over wider areas, as
will be afterwards shown, that a general change of climate may finally
be brought about.</p>

<p>In the sixth chapter, I stated the arguments derived from organic remains
for concluding that in the period when the carboniferous strata
were deposited, the temperature of the ocean and the air was more uniform
in the different seasons of the year, and in different latitudes, than
at present, and that there was a remarkable absence of cold as well as
great moisture in the atmosphere. It was also shown that the climate
had been modified more than once since that epoch, and that it had been
reduced, by successive changes, more and more nearly to that now prevailing
in the same latitudes. Farther, I endeavored, in the last chapter,
to prove that vicissitudes in climate of no less importance may be
expected to recur in future, if it be admitted that causes now active in
nature have power, in the lapse of ages, to produce considerable variations
in the relative position of land and sea. It remains to inquire
whether the alterations, which the geologist can prove to have <i>actually
taken place</i> at former periods, in the geographical features of the northern
hemisphere, coincide in their nature, and in the time of their occurrence,
with such revolutions in climate as might naturally have resulted, according
to the meteorological principles already explained.</p>

<p><i>Period of the primary fossiliferous rocks.</i>&mdash;The oldest system of strata
which afford by their organic remains any evidence as to climate, or the
former position of land and sea, are those formerly known as the <i>transition
rocks</i>, or what have since been termed Lower Silurian or "primary
fossiliferous" formations. These have been found in England,
France, Germany, Sweden, Russia, and other parts of central and northern
Europe, as also in the great Lake district of Canada and the United
States. The multilocular or chambered univalves, including the Nautilus,
and the corals, obtained from the limestones of these ancient groups,
have been compared to forms now most largely developed in tropical
seas. The corals, however, have been shown by M. Milne Edwards to
differ generally from all living zoophytes; so that conclusions as to a
warmer climate drawn from such remote analogies must be received with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
caution. Hitherto, few, if any, contemporaneous vegetable remains have
been noticed; but such as are mentioned agree more nearly with the
plants of the carboniferous era than any other, and would therefore
imply a warm and humid atmosphere entirely free from intense cold
throughout the year.</p>

<p>This absence or great scarcity of plants as well as of freshwater shells
and other indications of neighboring land, coupled with the wide extent
of marine strata of this age in Europe and North America, are facts
which imply such a state of physical geography (so far at least as regards
the northern hemisphere) as would, according to the principles
before explained, give rise to such a moist and equable climate. (See p.
109, and <a href="#f5">fig. 5</a>, p. 111.)</p>

<p><i>Carboniferous group.</i>&mdash;This group comes next in the order of succession;
and one of its principal members, the mountain limestone, was
evidently a marine formation, as is shown by the shells and corals which
it contains. That the ocean of that period was of considerable extent in
our latitudes, we may infer from the continuity of these calcareous strata
over large areas in Europe, Canada, and the United States. The same
group has also been traced in North America, towards the borders of
the arctic sea.<a name="FNanchor_196" id="FNanchor_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>There are also several regions in Scotland, and in the central and
northern parts of England, as well as in the United States, where marine
carboniferous limestones alternate with strata containing coal, in such
a manner as to imply the drifting down of plants by rivers into the sea,
and the alternate occupation of the same space by fresh and salt water.</p>

<p>Since the time of the earlier writers, no strata have been more extensively
investigated, both in Europe and North America, than those of
the ancient carboniferous group, and the progress of science has led to
a general belief that a large portion of the purest coal has been formed,
not, as was once imagined, by vegetable matter floated from a distance,
but by plants which grew on the spot, and somewhat in the manner of
peat on the spaces now covered by the beds of coal. The former existence
of land in some of these spaces has been proved, as already
stated, by the occurrence of numerous upright fossil trees, with their
roots terminating downwards in seams of coal; and still more generally
by the roots of trees (stigmari&aelig;) remaining in their natural position in
the clays which underlie almost every layer of coal.</p>

<p>As some nearly continuous beds of such coal have of late years been
traced in North America, over areas 100 or 200 miles and upwards in
diameter, it may be asked whether the large tracts of ancient land implied
by this fact are not inconsistent with the hypothesis of the general
prevalence of islands at the period under consideration? In reply, I
may observe that the coal-fields must originally have been low alluvial
grounds, resembling in situation the cypress-swamps of the Mississippi,
or the sunderbunds of the Ganges, being liable like them to be inundated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
at certain periods by a river or by the sea, if the land should be
depressed a few feet. All the phenomena, organic and inorganic, imply
conditions nowhere to be met with except in the deltas of large rivers.
We have to account for an abundant supply of fluviatile sediment, carried
for ages towards one and the same region, and capable of forming
strata of mud and sand thousands of feet, or even fathoms, in thickness,
many of them consisting of laminated shale, inclosing the leaves of ferns
and other terrestrial plants. We have also to explain the frequent intercalations
of root-beds, and the interposition here and there of brackish
and marine deposits, demonstrating the occasional presence of the
neighboring sea. But these forest-covered deltas could only have been
formed at the termination of large hydrographical basins, each drained
by a great river and its tributaries; and the accumulation of sediment
bears testimony to contemporaneous denudation on a large scale, and,
therefore, to a wide area of land, probably containing within it one or
more mountain chains.</p>

<p>In the case of the great Ohio or Appalachian coal-field, the largest
in the world, it seems clear that the uplands drained by one or more
great rivers were chiefly to the eastward, or they occupied a space now
filled by part of the Atlantic Ocean, for the mechanical deposits of mud
and sand increase greatly in thickness and coarseness of material as we
approach the eastern borders of the coal-field, or the southeast flanks
of the Alleghany mountains, near Philadelphia. In that region numerous
beds of pebbles, often of the size of a hen's egg, are seen to alternate
with beds of pure coal.</p>

<p>But the American coal-fields are all comprised within the 30th and
50th degrees of north latitude; and there is no reason to presume that
the lands at the borders of which they originated ever penetrated so far
or in such masses into the colder and arctic regions, so as to generate a
cold climate. In the southern hemisphere, where the predominance of
sea over land is now the distinguishing geographical feature, we nevertheless
find a large part of the continent of Australia, as well as New
Zealand, placed between the 30th and 50th degrees of S. latitude. The
two islands of New Zealand taken together, are between 800 and 900
miles in length, with a breadth in some parts of ninety miles, and they
stretch as far south as the 46th degree of latitude. They afford, therefore,
a wide area for the growth of a terrestrial vegetation, and the botany
of this region is characterized by abundance of ferns, one hundred
and forty species of which are already known, some of them attaining
the size of trees. In this respect the southern shores of New Zealand
in the 46th degree of latitude almost vie with tropical islands. Another
point of resemblance between the Flora of New Zealand and that of the
ancient carboniferous period is the prevalence of the fir tribe or of
coniferous wood.</p>

<p>An argument of some weight in corroboration of the theory above
explained respecting the geographical condition of the temperate and
arctic latitudes of the northern hemisphere in the carboniferous period<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
may also be derived from ah examination of those groups of strata which
immediately preceded the coal. The fossils of the Devonian and Silurian
strata in Europe and North America have led to the conclusion,
that they were formed for the most part in deep seas, far from land.
In those older strata land plants are almost as rare as they are abundant
or universal in the coal measures. Those ancient deposits, therefore,
may be supposed to have belonged to an epoch when dry land had
only just begun to be upraised from the deep; a theory which would
imply the existence during the carboniferous epoch of islands, instead of
an extensive continent, in the area where the coal was formed.</p>

<p>Such a state of things prevailing in the north, from the pole to the
30th parallel of latitude, if not neutralized by circumstances of a contrary
tendency in corresponding regions south of the line, would give
rise to a general warmth and uniformity of climate throughout the globe.</p>

<p><i>Changes in physical geography between the formation of the carboniferous
strata and the chalk.</i>&mdash;We have evidence in England that the
strata of the ancient carboniferous group, already adverted to, were, in
many instances, fractured and contorted, and often thrown into a vertical
position, before the deposition of some even of the oldest known secondary
rocks, such as the new red sandstone.</p>

<p>Fragments of the older formations are sometimes included in the conglomerates
of the more modern; and some of these fragments still retain
their fossil shells and corals, so as to enable us to determine the parent
rocks from whence they were derived. There are other proofs of the
disturbance at successive epochs of different secondary rocks before the
deposition of others; and satisfactory evidence that, during these reiterated
convulsions, the geographical features of the northern hemisphere
were frequently modified, and that from time to time new lands
emerged from the deep. The vegetation, during some parts of the period
in question (from the lias to the chalk inclusive), when genera allied
to Cycas and Zamia were abundant, appears to have approached to that
of the larger islands of the equatorial zone; such, for example, as we
now find in the West Indian archipelago.<a name="FNanchor_197" id="FNanchor_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> These islands appear to
have been drained by rivers of considerable size, which were inhabited
by crocodiles and gigantic oviparous reptiles, both herbivorous and carnivorous,
belonging for the most part to extinct genera. Of the contemporary
inhabitants of the land we have as yet acquired but scanty
information, but we know that there were flying reptiles, insects, and
small mammifers, allied to the marsupial tribes.</p>

<p>A freshwater deposit, called the Wealden, occurs in the upper part
of the secondary series of the south of England, which, by its extent
and fossils, attests the existence in that region of a large river draining
a continent or island of considerable dimensions. We know that this
land was clothed with wood, and inhabited by huge terrestrial reptiles
and birds. Its position so far to the north as the counties of Surrey and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span>Sussex, at a time when the mean temperature of the climate is supposed
to have been much hotter than at present, may at first sight appear inconsistent
with the theory before explained, that the heat was caused
by the gathering together of all the great masses of land in low latitudes,
while the northern regions were almost entirely sea. But it must not
be taken for granted that the geographical conditions already described
(p. <a href="#Page_109">109</a>, and <a href="#f5">fig. 5</a>, p. 111) as capable of producing the extreme of heat
were ever combined at any geological period of which we have yet obtained
information. It is more probable, from what has been stated in
the preceding chapters, that a slight approximation to such an extreme
state of things would be sufficient; in other words, if most of the dry
land were tropical, and scarcely any of it arctic or antarctic, a prodigious
elevation of temperature must ensue, even though a part of some continents
should penetrate far into the temperate zones.</p>

<p><i>Changes during the tertiary periods.</i>&mdash;The secondary and tertiary formations
of Europe, when considered separately, may be contrasted as
having very different characters; the secondary appearing to have been
deposited in open seas, the tertiary in regions where dry land, lakes,
bays, and perhaps inland seas, abounded. The secondary series is almost
exclusively marine; the tertiary, even the oldest part, contains lacustrine
strata, and not unfrequently freshwater and marine beds alternating.
In fact there is evidence of important geographical changes
having occurred between the deposition of the cretaceous system, or
uppermost of the secondary series, and that of the oldest tertiary group,
and still more between the era of the latter and that of the newer tertiary
formations. This change in the physical geography of Europe
and North America was accompanied by an alteration no less remarkable
in organic life, scarcely any <i>species</i> being common both to the secondary
and tertiary rocks, and the fossils of the latter affording evidence
of a different climate.</p>

<p>On the other hand, when we compare the tertiary formations of successive
ages, we trace a gradual approximation in the imbedded fossils,
from an assemblage in which extinct species predominate, to one where
the species agree for the most part with those now existing. In other
words, we find a gradual increase of animals and plants fitted for our
present climates, in proportion as the strata which we examine are more
modern. Now, during all these successive tertiary periods, there are
signs of a great increase of land in European and North American latitudes.
By reference to the map (<a href="#p1">Pl. 1</a>), and its description, p. <a href="#Page_121">121</a>.
the reader will see that about two-thirds of the present European lands
have emerged since the earliest tertiary group originated. Nor is this
the only revolution which the same region has undergone within the
period alluded to, some tracts which were previously land having gained
in altitude, others, on the contrary, having sunk below their former level.</p>

<p>That the existing lands were not all upheaved at once into their
present position is proved by the most striking evidence. Several Italian
geologists, even before the time of Brocchi, had justly inferred that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
the Apennines were elevated several thousand feet above the level of
the Mediterranean before the deposition of the modern Subapennine
beds which flank them on either side. What now constitutes the central
calcareous chain of the Apennines must for a long time have been a
narrow ridgy peninsula, branching off, at its northern extremity, from
the Alps near Savona. This peninsula has since been raised from one
to two thousand feet, by which movement the ancient shores, and, for a
certain extent, the bed of the contiguous sea, have been laid dry, both
on the side of the Mediterranean and the Adriatic.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 7.</span><a name="f7" id="f7"></a><img src="images/f7.png" width="500" height="172"
alt="Mediterranean and the Adriatic." title="" /></div>

<p>The nature of these vicissitudes will be explained by the accompanying
diagram, which represents a transverse section across the Italian
peninsula. The inclined strata A are the disturbed formations of the
Apennines, into which the ancient igneous rocks a are supposed to have
intruded themselves. At a lower level on each flank of the chain are
the more recent shelly beds <i>b b</i>, which often contain rounded pebbles
derived from the waste of contiguous parts of the older Apennine limestone.
These, it will be seen, are horizontal, and lie in what is termed
"unconformable stratification" on the more ancient series. They now
constitute a line of hills of moderate elevation between the sea and the
Apennines, but never penetrate to the higher and more ancient valleys
of that chain.</p>

<p>The same phenomena are exhibited in the Alps on a much grander
scale; those mountains being composed in some even of their higher regions
of the newer secondary and oldest tertiary formations, while they
are encircled by a great zone of more modern tertiary rocks both on
their southern flank towards the plains of the Po, and on the side of
Switzerland and Austria, and at their eastern termination towards Styria
and Hungary.<a name="FNanchor_198" id="FNanchor_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> This newer tertiary zone marks the position of former
seas or gulfs, like the Adriatic, wherein masses of strata accumulated,
some single groups of which are not inferior in thickness to the most
voluminous of our secondary formations in England. Some even of
these newer groups have been raised to the height of three or four thousand
feet, and in proportion to their antiquity, they generally rise to
greater heights, the older of them forming interior zones nearest to the
central ridges of the Alps. We have already ascertained that the Alps
gained accessions to their height and width at several successive peri<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>ods,
and that the last series of improvements occurred when the seas
were inhabited by many existing species of animals.</p>

<p>We may imagine some future series of convulsions once more to heave
up this stupendous chain, together with the adjoining bed of the sea, so
that the mountains of Europe may rival the Andes in elevation; in
which case the deltas of the Po, Adige, and Brenta, now encroaching
upon the Adriatic, might be uplifted so as to form another exterior belt
of considerable height around the southeastern flank of the Alps.</p>

<p>The Pyrenees, also, have acquired their present altitude, which in
Mont Perdu exceeds eleven thousand feet, since the deposition of the
nummulitic or Eocene division of the tertiary series. Some of the tertiary
strata at the base of the chain are raised to the height of only a
few hundred feet above the sea, and retain a horizontal position, without
partaking in general in the disturbance to which the older series
has been subjected; so that the great barrier between France and Spain
was almost entirely upheaved in the interval between the deposition of
certain groups of tertiary strata.</p>

<p>The remarkable break between the most modern of the known secondary
rocks and the oldest tertiary, may be apparent only, and ascribable
to the present deficiency of our information. Already the marles and
green sand of Heers near Tongres, in Belgium, observed by M. Dumont,
and the "pisolitic limestone" of the neighborhood of Paris, both intermediate
in age between the Maestricht chalk and the lower Eocene
strata, begin to afford us signs of a passage from one state of things to
another. Nevertheless, it is far from impossible that the interval between
the chalk and tertiary formations constituted an era in the earth's
history, when the transition from one class of organic beings to another
was, comparatively speaking, rapid. For if the doctrines above explained
in regard to vicissitudes of temperature are sound, it will follow
that changes of equal magnitude in the geographical features of the
globe may at different periods produce very unequal effects on climate;
and, so far as the existence of certain animals and plants depends
on climate, the duration of species would be shortened or protracted,
according to the rate at which the change of temperature
proceeded.</p>

<p>For even if we assume that the intensity of the subterranean disturbing
forces is uniform and capable of producing nearly equal amounts of
alteration on the surface of the planet, during equal periods of time, still
the rate of alteration in climate would be by no means uniform. Let us
imagine the quantity of land between the equator and the tropic in one
hemisphere to be to that in the other as thirteen to one, which, as before
stated, represents the unequal proportion of the extra-tropical lands in
the two hemispheres at present. (See figs. <a href="#f3">3</a> and <a href="#f4">4</a>, p. 110.) Then
let the first geographical change consist in the shifting of this preponderance
of land from one side of the line to the other; from the southern
hemisphere, for example, to the northern. Now this need not affect the
general temperature of the earth. But if, at another epoch, we suppose
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
a continuance of the same agency to transfer an equal volume of land
from the torrid zone to the temperate and arctic regions of the northern
and southern hemispheres, or into one of them, there might be so great
a refrigeration of the mean temperature <i>in all latitudes</i>, that scarcely
any of the pre-existing races of animals would survive; and, unless it
pleased the Author of Nature that the planet should be uninhabited,
new species, and probably of widely different forms, would then be substituted
in the room of the extinct. We ought not, therefore, to infer
that equal periods of time are always attended by an equal amount of
change in organic life, since a great fluctuation in the mean temperature
of the earth, the most influential cause which can be conceived in exterminating
whole races of animals and plants, must, in different epochs,
require unequal portions of time for its completion.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><small><span class="smcap">Plate</span> I. <i>Map showing the extent of surface in Europe which has at one period or
another been covered by the sea since the commencement of the deposition of the
older or Eocene Tertiary strata.</i></small></div>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a name="p1" id="p1"></a><a href="images/p1z.png"><img src="images/p1s.png" width="600" height="468"
alt="Map showing the extent of surface in Europe." title="" /></a></div>

<p>This map will enable the reader to perceive at a glance the great extent
of change in the physical geography of Europe, which can be proved
to have taken place since some of the older tertiary strata began to be
deposited. The proofs of submergence, during some part or other of
this period, in all the districts distinguished by ruled lines, are of a most
unequivocal character; for the area thus described is now covered by
deposits containing the fossil remains of animals which could only have
lived in salt water. The most ancient part of the period referred to cannot
be deemed very remote, considered geologically; because the deposits
of the Paris and London basins, and many other districts belonging
to the older tertiary epoch, are newer than the greater part of the
sedimentary rocks (those commonly called secondary and primary fossiliferous
or paleozoic) of which the crust of the globe is composed.
The species, moreover, of marine testacea, of which the remains are
found in these older tertiary formations, are not entirely distinct from
such as now live. Yet, notwithstanding the comparatively recent epoch
to which this retrospect is carried, the variations in the distribution of
land and sea depicted on the map form only a part of those which must
have taken place during the period under consideration. Some approximation
has merely been made to an estimate of the amount of <i>sea converted
into land</i> in parts of Europe best known to geologists; but we
cannot determine how much land has become sea during the same period;
and there may have been repeated interchanges of land and water in the
same places, changes of which no account is taken in the map, and respecting
the amount of which little accurate information can ever be obtained.</p>

<p>I have extended the sea in some instances beyond the limits of the
land now covered by tertiary formations, and marine drift, because other
geological data have been obtained for inferring the submergence of these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
tracts after the deposition of the Eocene strata had begun. Thus, for
example, there are good reasons for concluding that part of the chalk of
England (the North and South Downs, for example, together with the
intervening secondary tracts) continued beneath the sea until the oldest
tertiary beds had begun to accumulate.</p>

<p>A strait of the sea separating England and Wales has also been introduced,
on the evidence afforded by shells of existing species found in
a deposit of gravel, sand, loam, and clay, called the northern drift, by
Sir R. Murchison.<a name="FNanchor_199" id="FNanchor_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> And Mr. Trimmer has discovered similar recent
marine shells on the northern coast of North Wales, and on Moel Tryfane,
near the Menai Straits, at the height of 1392 feet above the level
of the sea!</p>

<p>Some raised sea-beaches, and drift containing marine shells, which I
examined in 1843, between Limerick and Dublin, and which have been
traced over other parts of Ireland by different geologists, have required
an extension of the dark lines so as to divide that island into several.
In improving this part of my map I have been especially indebted to
the assistance of Mr. Oldham, who in 1843 announced to the British Association
at Cork the fact that at the period when the drift or glacial beds
were deposited, Ireland must have formed an archipelago such as is here
depicted. A considerable part of Scotland might also have been represented
in a similar manner as under water when the drift originated.</p>

<p>A portion of Brittany is divided into islands, because it is known to
be covered with patches of marine tertiary strata chiefly miocene. When
I examined these in 1830 and 1843, I convinced myself that the sea
must have covered much larger areas than are now occupied by these
small and detached deposits. The former connection of the White Sea
and the Gulf of Finland is proved by the fact that a multitude of huge
erratic blocks extend over the intervening space, and a large portion of
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark, as well as Germany and Russia, are
represented as sea, on the same evidence, strengthened by the actual
occurrence of fossil sea-shells, of recent species, in the drift of various
portions of those countries. The submergence of considerable areas
under large bodies of fresh water, during the tertiary period, of which
there are many striking geological proofs in Auvergne, and elsewhere,
has not been expressed by ruled lines. They bear testimony to the
former existence of neighboring lands, and a certain elevation of the
areas where they occur above the level of the ocean; they are therefore
left blank, together with all the space that cannot be demonstrated
to have been part of the sea at some time or other, since the commencement
of the Eocene epoch.</p>

<p>In compiling this map, which has been entirely recast since the first
edition, I have availed myself of the latest geological maps of the British
isles, and north of Europe; also of those published by the government
surveyors of France, MM. de Beaumont and Dufresnoy; the map of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
Germany and part of Europe, by Von Dechen, and that of Italy by
M. Tchihatchoff (Berlin, 1842). Lastly, Sir R. Murchison's important
map of Russia, and the adjoining countries, has enabled me to mark out
not only a considerable area, previously little known, in which tertiary
formations occur; but also a still wider expanse, over which the northern
drift, and erratic blocks with occasional marine shells, are traceable.
The southern limits of these glacial deposits in Russia and Germany indicate
the boundary, so far as we can now determine it, of the northern
ocean, at a period immediately antecedent to that of the human race.</p>

<p>I was anxious, even in the title of this map, to guard the reader against
the supposition that it was intended to represent the state of the physical
geography of part of Europe at any <i>one point of time</i>. The difficulty,
or rather the impossibility, of restoring the geography of the globe as it
may have existed at any former period, especially a remote one, consists
in this, that we can only point out where part of the sea has been turned
into land, and are almost always unable to determine what land may
have become sea. All maps, therefore, pretending to represent the
geography of remote geological epochs must be ideal. The map under
consideration is not a restoration of a former state of things, at any particular
moment of time, but a synoptical view of a certain amount of one
kind of change (the conversion of sea into land) known to have been
brought about within a given period.</p>

<p>It may be proper to remark that the vertical movements to which the
land is subject in certain regions, occasion alternately the subsidence and
the uprising of the surface; and that, by such oscillations at successive
periods, a great area may have been entirely covered with marine deposits,
although the whole may never have been beneath the waters at
one time; nay, even though the relative proportion of land and sea may
have continued unaltered throughout the whole period. I believe, however,
that since the commencement of the tertiary period, the dry land
in the northern hemisphere has been continually on the increase, both
because it is now greatly in excess beyond the average proportion which
land generally bears to water on the globe, and because a comparison
of the secondary and tertiary strata affords indications, as I have already
shown, of a passage from the condition of an ocean interspersed with
islands to that of a large continent.</p>

<p>But supposing it were possible to represent all the vicissitudes in the
distribution of land and sea that have occurred during the tertiary period,
and to exhibit not only the actual existence of land where there
was once sea, but also the extent of surface now submerged which may
once have been land, the map would still fail to express all the important
revolutions in physical geography which have taken place within the
epoch under consideration. For the oscillations of level, as was before
stated, have not merely been such as to lift up the land from below the
water, but in some cases to occasion a rise of many thousand feet above
the sea. Thus the Alps have acquired an additional altitude of 4000,
and even in some places 10,000 feet; and the Apennines owe a considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
part of their present height to subterranean convulsions which
have happened within the tertiary epoch.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some mountain chains may have been lowered
during the same series of ages, in an equal degree, and shoals may have
been converted into deep abysses.<a name="FNanchor_200" id="FNanchor_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Since this map was recast in 1847,
geologists have very generally come to the conclusion that the nummulitic
limestone, together with the overlying fucoidal grit and shale, called
"Flysch," in the Alps, belongs to the older tertiary or Eocene group.
As these nummulitic rocks enter into the structure of some of the most
lofty and disturbed parts of the Alps, Apennines, Carpathians, Pyrenees,
and other mountain chains, and form many of the elevated lands of Africa
and Asia, their position almost implies the ubiquity of the
post-Eocene ocean, not, indeed, by the simultaneous, but by the successive,
occupancy of the whole ground by its waters.<a name="FNanchor_201" id="FNanchor_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p><i>Concluding remarks on changes in physical geography.</i>&mdash;The foregoing
observations, it may be said, are confined chiefly to Europe, and therefore
merely establish the increase of dry land in a space which constitutes
but a small portion of the northern hemisphere; but it was stated
in the preceding chapter, that the great Lowland of Siberia, lying chiefly
between the latitudes 55&deg; and 75&deg; N. (an area nearly equal to all Europe),
is covered for the most part by marine strata, which, from the
account given by Pallas, and more recently by Sir R. Murchison, belongs
to a period when all or nearly all the shells were of a species still living
in the north. The emergence, therefore, of this area from the deep is,
comparatively speaking, a very modern event, and must, as before remarked,
have caused a great increase of cold throughout the globe.</p>

<p>Upon a review, then, of all the facts above enumerated, respecting
the ancient geography of the globe as attested by geological monuments,
there appear good grounds for inferring that changes of climate coincided
with remarkable revolutions in the former position of sea and land. A
wide expanse of ocean, interspersed with islands, seems to have pervaded
the northern hemisphere at the periods when the Silurian and carboniferous
rocks were formed, and a warm and very uniform temperature
then prevailed. Subsequent modifications in climate accompanied the
deposition of the secondary formations, when repeated changes were effected
in the physical geography of our northern latitudes. Lastly, the
refrigeration became most decided, and the climate most nearly assimilated
to that now enjoyed, when the lands in Europe and northern Asia had
attained their full extension, and the mountain chains their actual height.</p>

<p>Soon after the first publication of this theory of climate, an objection
was made by an anonymous German critic in 1833 that there are no
geological proofs of the prevalence at any former period of a temperature
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span><i>lower</i> than that now enjoyed; whereas, if the causes above assigned
were the true ones, it might reasonably have been expected that fossil
remains would sometimes indicate colder as well as hotter climates than
those now established.<a name="FNanchor_202" id="FNanchor_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> In answer to this objection, I may suggest,
that our present climates are probably far more distant from the extreme
of possible heat than from its opposite extreme of cold. A glance at
the map (<a href="#f6">fig. 6</a>, p. 111) will show that all the existing lands might be
placed between the 30th parallels of latitude on each side of the equator,
and that even then they would by no means fill that space. In no other
position would they give rise to so high a temperature. But the present
geographical condition of the earth is so far removed from such a state
of things, that the land lying between the poles and the parallels of 30,
is in great excess; so much so that, instead of being to the sea in the
proportion of 1 to 3, which is as near as possible the average general
ratio throughout the globe, it is 9 to 23.<a name="FNanchor_203" id="FNanchor_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> Hence it ought not to surprise
us if, in our geological retrospect, embracing perhaps a small part
only of a complete cycle of change in the terrestrial climates, we should
happen to discover everywhere the signs of a higher temperature. The
strata hitherto examined may have originated when the quantity of equatorial
land was always decreasing and the land in regions nearer the
poles augmenting in height and area, until at length it attained its present
excess in high latitudes. There is nothing improbable in supposing
that the geographical revolutions of which we have hitherto obtained
proofs had this general tendency; and in that case the refrigeration must
have been constant, although, for reasons before explained, the rate of
cooling may not have been uniform.</p>

<p>It may, however, be as well to recall the reader's attention to what
was before said of the indication brought to light of late years, of a considerable
oscillation of temperature, in the period immediately preceding
the human era. We have seen that on examining some of the most
northern deposits, those commonly called the northern drift in Scotland,
Ireland, and Canada, in which nearly all, in some cases, perhaps all, the
fossil shells are of recent species, we discover the signs of a climate colder
than that now prevailing in corresponding latitudes on both sides the
Atlantic. It appears that an arctic fauna specifically resembling that
of the present seas, extended farther to the south than now. This opinion
is derived partly from the known habitations of the corresponding
living species, and partly from the abundance of certain genera of shells
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
and the absence of others.<a name="FNanchor_204" id="FNanchor_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> The date of the refrigeration thus inferred
appears to coincide very nearly with the era of the dispersion of erratic
blocks over Europe and North America, a phenomenon which will be ascribed
in the sequel (ch. 16) to the cold then prevailing in the northern
hemisphere. The force, moreover, of the German critic's objection has
been since in a great measure destroyed, by the larger and more profound
knowledge acquired in the last few years of the ancient carboniferous flora,
which has led the ablest botanists to adopt the opinion, that the climate
of the coal period was remarkable for its warmth, moisture, equability,
and freedom from cold, rather than the intensity of its <i>tropical heat</i>. We
are therefore no longer entitled to assume that there has been a constant
and gradual decline in the absolute amount of heat formerly contained
in the atmosphere and waters of the ocean, such as it was conjectured
might have emanated from the incandescent central nucleus of a new
and nearly fluid planet, before the interior had lost, by radiation into
surrounding space, a great part of its original high temperature.</p>

<p><i>Astronomical causes of fluctuations in climate.</i>&mdash;Sir John Herschel
has lately inquired, whether there are any astronomical causes which
may offer a possible explanation of the difference between the actual
climate of the earth's surface, and those which formerly appear to have
prevailed. He has entered upon this subject, he says, "impressed with
the magnificence of that view of geological revolutions, which regards
them rather as regular and necessary effects of great and general causes,
than as resulting from a series of convulsions and catastrophes, regulated
by no laws, and reducible to no fixed principles." Geometers, he adds,
have demonstrated the absolute invariability of the mean distance of the
earth from the sun; whence it would at first seem to follow, that the
mean annual supply of light and heat derived from that luminary would
be alike invariable: but a closer consideration of the subject will show,
that this would not be a legitimate conclusion; but that on the contrary,
the <i>mean</i> amount of solar radiation is dependent on the eccentricity of
the earth's orbit, and therefore liable to variation.<a name="FNanchor_205" id="FNanchor_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p>Now the eccentricity of the orbit, he continues, is actually diminishing,
and has been so for ages beyond the records of history. In consequence,
the ellipse is in a state of approach to a circle, and the annual
average of solar heat radiated to the earth is actually on the <i>decrease</i>. So
far this is in accordance with geological evidence, which indicates a general
refrigeration of climate; but the question remains, whether the amount
of diminution which the eccentricity may have ever undergone can be supposed
sufficient to account for any sensible refrigeration. The calculations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
necessary to determine this point, though practicable, have never
yet been made, and would be extremely laborious; for they must embrace
all the perturbations which the most influential planets, Venus,
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, would cause in the earth's orbit, and in each
other's movements round the sun.</p>

<p>The problem is also very complicated, inasmuch as it depends not
merely on the ellipticity of the earth's orbit, but on the assumed temperature
of the celestial spaces beyond the earth's atmosphere; a matter
still open to discussion, and on which M. Fourier and Sir J. Herschel
have arrived at very different opinions. But if, says Herschel, we suppose
an extreme case, as if the earth's orbit should ever become as eccentric
as that of the planet Juno or Pallas, a great change of climate
might be conceived to result, the winter and summer temperatures
being sometimes mitigated, and at others exaggerated, in the same latitudes.</p>

<p>It is much to be desired that the calculations alluded to were executed,
as even if they should demonstrate, as M. Arago thinks highly
probable,<a name="FNanchor_206" id="FNanchor_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> that the mean amount of solar radiation can never be materially
affected by irregularities in the earth's motion, it would still be
satisfactory to ascertain the point. Such inquiries, however, can never
supersede the necessity of investigating the consequences of the varying
position of continents, shifted as we know them to have been during
successive epochs, from one part of the globe to the other.</p>

<p>Another astronomical hypothesis respecting the possible cause of secular
variations in climate, has been proposed by a distinguished mathematician
and philosopher, M. Poisson. He begins by assuming, 1st,
that the sun and our planetary system are not stationary, but carried
onward by a common movement through space; 2dly, that every point
in space receives heat as well as light from innumerable stars surrounding
it on all sides, so that if a right line of indefinite length be produced
in any direction from such a point, it must encounter a star either visible
or invisible to us. 3dly, He then goes on to assume, that the different
regions of space, which in the course of millions of years are traversed
by our system, must be of very unequal temperature, inasmuch as some
of them must receive a greater, others a less, quantity of radiant heat
from the great stellary inclosure. If the earth, he continues, or any
other large body, pass from a hotter to a colder region, it would not
readily lose in the second all the heat which it has imbibed in the first
region, but retain a temperature increasing downwards from the surface,
as in the actual condition of our planet.<a name="FNanchor_207" id="FNanchor_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<p>Now the opinion originally suggested by Sir W. Herschel, that our
sun and its attendant planets were all moving onward through space,
in the direction of the constellation Hercules, is very generally thought
by eminent astronomers to be confirmed. But even if its reality be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
no longer matter of doubt, conjectures as to its amount are still vague
and uncertain; and great, indeed, must be the extent of the movement
before this cause alone can work any material alteration in the terrestrial
climates. Mr. Hopkins, when treating of this theory, remarked, that so
far as we were acquainted with the position of the stars not very remote
from the sun, they seem to be so distant from each other, that there are
no points in space among them, where the intensity of radiating heat
would be comparable to that which the earth derives from the sun, except
at points very near to each star. Thus, in order that the earth
should derive a degree of heat from stellar radiation comparable to that
now derived from the sun, she must be in close proximity to some particular
star, leaving the aggregate effect of radiation from the other stars
nearly the same as at present. This approximation, however, to a single
star could not take place consistently with the preservation of the
motion of the earth about the sun, according to its present laws.</p>

<p>Suppose our sun should approach a star within the present distance
of Neptune. That planet could no longer remain a member of the solar
system, and the motions of the other planets would be disturbed in a
degree which no one has ever contemplated as probable since the existence
of the solar system. But such a star, supposing it to be no larger
than the sun, and to emit the same quantity of heat, would not send to
the earth much more than one-thousandth part of the heat which she
derives from the sun, and would therefore produce only a very small
change in terrestrial temperature.<a name="FNanchor_208" id="FNanchor_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p><i>Variable splendor of stars.</i>&mdash;There is still another astronomical suggestion
respecting the possible causes of secular variations in the terrestrial
climates which deserves notice. It has long been known that certain
stars are liable to great and periodical fluctuations in splendor, and
Sir J. Herschel has lately ascertained (Jan. 1840), that a large and
brilliant star, called <i>alpha</i> Orionis, sustained, in the course of six weeks,
a loss of nearly half its light. "This phenomenon," he remarks, "cannot
fail to awaken attention, and revive those speculations which were
first put forth by my father Sir W. Herschel, respecting the possibility
of a change in the lustre of <i>our sun itself</i>. If there really be a community
of nature between the sun and fixed stars, every proof that we obtain
of the extensive prevalence of such periodical changes in those remote
bodies, adds to the probability of finding something of the kind
nearer home." Referring then to the possible bearing of such facts on
ancient revolutions, in terrestrial climates, he says, that "it is a matter
of observed fact, that many stars <i>have</i> undergone, in past ages, within
the records of astronomical history, very extensive changes in apparent
lustre, without a change of distance adequate to producing such an effect.
If our sun were even <i>intrinsically</i> much brighter than at present,
the mean temperature of the surface of our globe would, of course, be
proportionally greater. I speak now not of periodical, but of secular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
changes. But the argument is complicated with the consideration of
the possibly imperfect transparency of the celestial spaces, and with the
cause of that imperfect transparency, which may be due to material
non-luminous particles diffused irregularly in patches analogous to nebul&aelig;,
but of greater extent&mdash;to <i>cosmical clouds</i>, in short&mdash;of whose existence
we have, I think, some indication in the singular and apparently
capricious phenomena of temporary stars, and perhaps in the recent
extraordinary sudden increase and hardly less sudden diminution of
&#951; <i>Argus</i>."<a name="FNanchor_209" id="FNanchor_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>More recently (1852) Schwabe has observed that the spots on the
sun alternately increase and decrease in the course of every ten years,
and Captain Sabine has pointed out that this variable obscuration coincides
in time both as to its maximum and minimum with changes in all
those terrestrial magnetic variations which are caused by the sun.
Hence he infers that the period of alteration in the spots is a <i>solar magnetic
period</i>. Assuming such to be the case, the variable light of some
stars may indicate a similar phenomenon, or they may be stellar magnetic
periods, differing only in the degree of obscuration and its duration.
And as hitherto we have perceived no fluctuation in the heat
received by the earth from the sun coincident with the <i>solar magnetic
period</i>, so the fluctuations in the brilliancy of the stars may not perhaps
be attended with any perceptible alteration in their power of radiating
heat. But before we can speculate with advantage in this new
and interesting field of inquiry, we require more facts and observations.</p>

<p><i>Supposed gradual diminution of the earth's primitive
heat.</i>&mdash;The gradual diminution of the supposed primitive heat of the globe has been
resorted to by many geologists as the principal cause of alterations of
climate. The matter of our planet is imagined, in accordance with the
conjectures of Leibnitz, to have been originally in an intensely heated
state, and to have been parting ever since with portions of its heat, and
at the same time contracting its dimensions. There are, undoubtedly,
good grounds for inferring from recent observation and experiment, that
the temperature of the earth increases as we descend from the surface
to that slight depth to which man can penetrate: but there are no
positive proofs of a secular decrease of internal heat accompanied by
contraction. On the contrary, La Place has shown, by reference to
astronomical observations made in the time of Hipparchus, that in the
last two thousand years at least there has been no sensible contraction
of the globe by cooling; for had this been the case, even to an extremely
small amount, the day would have been shortened, whereas its
length has certainly not diminished during that period by 1/300th of a
second.</p>

<p>Baron Fourier, after making a curious series of experiments on the
cooling of incandescent bodies, considers it to be proved mathematically,
that the actual distribution of heat in the earth's envelope is precisely
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
that which would have taken place if the globe had been formed in a
medium of a very high temperature, and had afterwards been constantly
cooled.<a name="FNanchor_210" id="FNanchor_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> He contends, that although no contraction can be demonstrated
to have taken place within the historical period (the operation
being slow and the time of observation limited), yet it is no less certain
that heat is annually passing out by radiation from the interior of the
globe into the planetary spaces. He even undertook to demonstrate
that the quantity of heat thus transmitted into space in the course of
every century, through every square metre of the earth's surface, would
suffice to melt a column of ice having a square metre for its base, and
being three metres (or 9 feet 10 inches) high.</p>

<p>It is at the same time denied, that there is any assignable mode in
which the heat thus lost by radiation can be again restored to the earth,
and consequently the interior of our planet must, from the moment of
its creation, have been subject to refrigeration, and is destined together
with the sun and stars forever to grow colder. But I shall point out
in the sequel (chapter 31) many objections to these views, and to the
theory of the intense heat of the earth's central nucleus, and shall then
inquire how far the observed augmentation of temperature, as we descend
below the surface, may be referable to other causes unconnected
with the supposed pristine fluidity of the entire globe.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER IX.</h4>

<h6>THEORY OF THE PROGRESSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF ORGANIC LIFE AT
SUCCESSIVE GEOLOGICAL PERIODS.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Theory of the progressive development of organic life&mdash;Evidence in its support
inconclusive&mdash;Vertebrated animals, and plants of the most perfect organization,
in strata of very high antiquity&mdash;Differences between the organic remains of
successive formations&mdash;Comparative modern origin of the human
race&mdash;The
popular doctrine of successive development not established by the admission
that man is of modern origin&mdash;Introduction of man, to what extent a change in
the system.</p></div>

<p><i>Progressive development of organic life.</i>&mdash;In the preceding chapters I
have considered whether revolutions in the general climate of the globe
afford any just ground of opposition to the doctrine that the former
changes of the earth which are treated of in geology belong to one uninterrupted
series of physical events governed by ordinary causes.
Against this doctrine some popular arguments have been derived from
the great vicissitudes of the organic creation in times past; I shall
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
therefore proceed to the discussion of such objections, which have been
thus formally advanced by the late Sir Humphrey Davy. "It is impossible,"
he affirms, "to defend the proposition, that the present order
of things is the ancient and constant order of nature, only modified by
existing laws: in those strata which are deepest, and which must, consequently,
be supposed to be the earliest deposited, forms even of vegetable
life are rare; shells and vegetable remains are found in the next
order; the bones of fishes and oviparous reptiles exist in the following
class; the remains of birds, with those of the same genera mentioned
before, in the next order; those of quadrupeds of extinct species in a
still more recent class; and it is only in the loose and slightly consolidated
strata of gravel and sand, and which are usually called diluvian
formations, that the remains of animals such as now people the globe
are found, with others belonging to extinct species. But, in none of
these formations, whether called secondary, tertiary, or diluvial, have
the remains of man, or any of his works, been discovered; and whoever
dwells upon this subject must be convinced, that the present order
of things, and the comparatively recent existence of man as the master
of the globe, is as certain as the destruction of a former and a different
order, and the extinction of a number of living forms which have no
types in being. In the oldest secondary strata there are no remains of
such animals as now belong to the surface; and in the rocks, which
may be regarded as more recently deposited, these remains occur but
rarely, and with abundance of extinct species;&mdash;there seems, as it were,
a gradual approach to the present system of things, and a succession of
destructions and creations preparatory to the existence of man."<a name="FNanchor_211" id="FNanchor_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>In the above passages, the author deduces two important conclusions
from geological data: first, that in the successive groups of strata,
from the oldest to the most recent, there is a progressive development
of organic life, from the simplest to the most complicated forms;&mdash;secondly,
that man is of comparatively recent origin, and these conclusions
he regards as inconsistent with the doctrine, "that the present
order of things is the ancient and constant order of nature only modified
by existing laws."</p>

<p>With respect, then, to the first of these propositions, we may ask
whether the theory of the progressive development of animal and vegetable
life, and their successive advancement from a simple to a more
perfect state, has any secure foundation in fact? No geologists who
are in possession of all the data now established respecting fossil remains,
will for a moment contend for the doctrine in all its detail, as
laid down by the distinguished philosopher to whose opinions we have
referred: but naturalists, who are not unacquainted with recent discoveries,
continue to defend it in a modified form. They say that in the
first period of the world (by which they mean the earliest of which we
have yet brought to light any memorials), the vegetation was characterized
by a predominance of cryptogamic plants, while the animals
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
which coexisted were almost entirely confined to zoophytes, testacea,
and a few fish. Plants of a less simple structure, conifer&aelig; and cycade&aelig;,
flourished largely in the next epoch, when oviparous reptiles began
also to abound. Lastly, the terrestrial flora became most diversified
and most perfect when the highest orders of animals, the mammalia
and birds, were called into existence.</p>

<p>Now in the first place, it may be observed, that many naturalists are
guilty of no small inconsistency in endeavoring to connect the phenomena
of the earliest vegetation with a nascent condition of organic life,
and at the same time to deduce from the numerical predominance of
certain forms, the greater heat or uniformity of the ancient climate.
The arguments in favor of the latter conclusion are without any force,
unless we can assume that the rules followed by the Author of Nature
in the creation and distribution of organic beings were the same formerly
as now; and that, as certain families of animals and plants are
now most abundant in, or exclusively confined to regions where there is
a certain temperature, a certain degree of humidity, a certain intensity
of light, and other conditions, so also analogous phenomena were exhibited
at every former era.</p>

<p>If this postulate be denied, and the prevalence of particular families
be declared to depend on a certain order of precedence in the introduction
of different classes into the earth, and if it be maintained that the
standard of organization was raised successively, we must then ascribe
the numerical preponderance, in the earlier ages, of plants of simpler
structure, <i>not to the heat</i>, or other climatal conditions, but to those different
laws which regulate organic life in newly created worlds.</p>

<p>Before we can infer a warm and uniform temperature in high latitudes,
from the presence of 250 species of ferns, some of them arborescent,
accompanied by lycopadiac&aelig; of large size, and araucari&aelig;, we
must be permitted to assume, that at all times, past, present, and
future, a heated and moist atmosphere pervading the northern hemisphere
has a tendency to produce in the vegetation a predominance of
analogous forms.</p>

<p>It should moreover be borne in mind, when we are considering the
question of development from a botanical point of view, that naturalists
are by no means agreed as to the existence of an ascending scale of
organization in the vegetable world corresponding to that which is very
generally recognized in animals. "From the sponge to man," in the
language of De Blainville, there may be a progressive chain of being,
although often broken and imperfect; but if we seek to classify plants
according to a linear arrangement, ascending gradually from the lichen
to the lily or the rose, we encounter incomparably greater difficulties.
Yet the doctrine of a more highly developed organization in the plants
created at successive periods presupposes the admission of such a
graduated scale.</p>

<p>We have as yet obtained but scanty information respecting the state
of the terrestrial flora at periods antecedent to the coal. In the carboniferous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
epoch, about 500 species of fossil plants are enumerated by
Adolphe Brongniart, which we may safely regard as a mere fragment of
an ancient flora; since, in Europe alone, there are now no less than
11,000 living species. I have already hinted that the plants which
produced coal were not drifted from a distance, but that nearly all of
them grew on the spots where they became fossil. They appear to
have belonged, as before explained (p. 115), to a peculiar class of <i>stations</i>,&mdash;to
low level and swampy regions, in the deltas of large rivers,
slightly elevated above the level of the sea. From the study, therefore,
of such a vegetation, we can derive but little insight into the nature
of the contemporaneous upland flora, still less of the plants of the
mountainous or Alpine country; and if so, we are enabled to account
for the apparent monotony of the vegetation, although its uniform
character was doubtless in part owing to a greater uniformity of climate
then prevailing throughout the globe. Some of the commonest trees of
this period, such as the sigillari&aelig;, which united the structure of ferns
and of cycade&aelig;, departed very widely from all known living types.
The conifer&aelig; and ferns, on the contrary, were very closely allied to
living genera. It is remarkable that none of the exogens of Lindley
(dicotyledonous angiosperms of Brongniart), which comprise
four-fifths
of the living flora of the globe, and include all the forest trees of
Europe except the fir-tribe, have yet been discovered in the coal measures,
and a very small number&mdash;fifteen species only&mdash;of monocotyledons.
If several of these last are true plants, an opinion to which Messrs.
Lindley, Unger, Corda, and other botanists of note incline, the question
whether any of the most highly organized plants are to be met with in
ancient strata is at once answered in the affirmative. But the determination
of these palms being doubtful, we have as yet in the coal no
positive proofs either of the existence of the most perfect, or of the
most simple forms of flowering or flowerless vegetation. We have no
fungi, lichens, hepatici or mosses: yet this latter class may have been
as fully represented then as now.</p>

<p>In the flora of the secondary eras, all botanists agree that palms
existed, although in Europe plants of the family of zamia and cycas
together with conifer&aelig; predominated, and must have given a peculiar
aspect to the flora. As only 200 or 300 species of plants are known
in all the rocks ranging from the Trias to the Oolite inclusive, our data
are too scanty as yet to affirm whether the vegetation of this second
epoch was or was not on the whole of a simpler organization than that
of our own times.</p>

<p>In the Lower Cretaceous formation, near Aix-la-Chapelle, the leaves
of a great many dicotyledonous trees have lately been discovered by
Dr. Debey, establishing the important fact of the coexistence of a large
number of angiosperms with cycade&aelig;, and with that rich reptilian fauna
comprising the ichthyosaur, plesiosaur, and pterodactyl, which some had
supposed to indicate a state of the atmosphere unfavorable to a dicotyledonous
vegetation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>The number of plants hitherto obtained from <i>tertiary</i> strata of different
ages is very limited, but is rapidly increasing. They are referable
to a much greater variety of families and classes than an equal number
of fossil species taken from secondary or primary rocks, the angiosperms
bearing the same proportion to the gymnosperms and acrogens
as in the present flora of the globe. This greater variety may, doubtless,
be partly ascribed to the greater diversity of stations in which the plants
grew, as we have in this case an opportunity, rarely enjoyed in studying
the secondary fossils, of investigating inland or lacustrine deposits
accumulated at different heights above the sea, and containing the memorials
of plants washed down from adjoining mountains.</p>

<p>In regard, then, to the strata from the cretaceous to the uppermost
tertiary inclusive, we may affirm that we find in them all the principal
classes of living plants, and during this vast lapse of time four or five
complete changes in the vegetation occurred, yet no step whatever was
made in advance at any of these periods by the addition of more highly
organized species.</p>

<p>If we next turn to the fossils of the animal kingdom, we may inquire
whether, when they are arranged by the geologists in a chronological
series, they imply that beings of more highly developed structure and
greater intelligence entered upon the earth at successive epochs, those
of the simplest organization being the first created, and those more
highly organized being the last.</p>

<p>Our knowledge of the Silurian fauna is at present derived entirely
from rocks of marine origin, no fresh-water strata of such high antiquity
having yet been met with. The fossils, however, of these ancient rocks
at once reduce the theory of progressive development to within very
narrow limits, for already they comprise a very full representation of the
radiata, mollusca, and articulata proper to the sea. Thus, in the great
division of radiata, we find asteriod and helianthoid zoophytes, besides
crinoid and cystidean echinoderms. In the mollusca, between
200 and 300 species of cephalopoda are enumerated. In the articulata
we have the crustaceans represented by more than 200 species of trilobites,
besides other genera of the same class. The remains of fish are
as yet confined to the upper part of the Silurian series; but some of
these belong to placoid fish, which occupy a high grade in the scale of
organization. Some naturalists have assumed that the earliest fauna
was exclusively marine, because we have not yet found a single Silurian
helix, insect, bird, terrestrial reptile or mammifer; but when we carry
back our investigation to a period so remote from the present, we ought
not to be surprised if the only accessible strata should be limited to
deposits formed far from land, because the ocean probably occupied
then, as now, the greater part of the earth's surface. After so many
entire geographical revolutions, the chances are nearly three to one in
favor of our finding that such small portions of the existing continents
and islands as expose Silurian strata to view, should coincide in position
with the ancient ocean rather than the land. We must not, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
too hastily infer, from the absence of fossil bones of mammalia in the
older rocks, that the highest class of vertebrated animals did not exist
in remoter ages. There are regions at present, in the Indian and Pacific
Oceans, coextensive in area with the continents of Europe and North
America, where we might dredge the bottom and draw up thousands
of shells and corals, without obtaining one bone of a land quadruped.
Suppose our mariners were to report, that, on sounding in the Indian
Ocean near some coral reefs, and at some distance from the land, they
drew up on hooks attached to their line portions of a leopard, elephant,
or tapir, should we not be skeptical as to the accuracy of their statements?
and if we had no doubt of their veracity, might we not suspect
them to be unskilful naturalists? or, if the fact were unquestioned,
should we not be disposed to believe that some vessel had been wrecked
on the spot?</p>

<p>The casualties must always be rare by which land quadrupeds are
swept by rivers far out into the open sea, and still rarer the contingency
of such a floating body not being devoured by sharks or other predaceous
fish, such as were those of which we find the teeth preserved in
some of the carboniferous strata. But if the carcass should escape, and
should happen to sink where sediment was in the act of accumulating,
and if the numerous causes of subsequent disintegration should not efface
all traces of the body, included for countless ages in solid rock, is
it not contrary to all calculation of chances that we should hit upon the
exact spot&mdash;that mere point in the bed of an ancient ocean, where the
precious relic was entombed? Can we expect for a moment, when we
have only succeeded, amidst several thousand fragments of corals and
shells, in finding a few bones of <i>aquatic</i> or <i>amphibious</i> animals, that we
should meet with a single skeleton of an inhabitant of the land?</p>

<p>Clarence, in his dream, saw, "in the slimy bottom of the deep,"</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">&mdash;&mdash;a thousand fearful wrecks;</span>
<span class="i0">A thousand men, that fishes gnaw'd upon:</span>

<p>Had he also beheld, amid "the dead bones that lay scattered by," the
carcasses of lions, deer, and the other wild tenants of the forest and the
plain, the fiction would have been deemed unworthy of the genius of
Shakspeare. So daring a disregard of probability and violation of analogy
would have been condemned as unpardonable, even where the poet
was painting those incongruous images which present themselves to a
disturbed imagination during the visions of the night.</p>

<p>Until lately it was supposed that the old red sandstone, or Devonian
rocks, contained no vertebrate remains except those of fish, but in 1850
the footprints of a chelonian, and in 1851 the skeleton of a reptile, allied
both to the batrachians and lizards, were found in a sandstone of
that age near Elgin in Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_212" id="FNanchor_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> Up to the year 1844 it was laid
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
down as a received dogma in many works of high authority in geology,
that reptiles were not created until after the close of the carboniferous
epoch. In the course of that year, however, Hermann Von Meyer announced
the discovery, in the coal measures of Rhenish Bavaria, of a
reptile, called by him Apateon, related to the salamanders; and in
1847 three species of another genus, called archegosaurus by Goldfuss,
were obtained from the coal of Saarbr&uuml;ck, between Treves and Strasburg.
The footprints of a large quadruped, probably batrachian, had
also been observed by Dr. King in the carboniferous rocks of Pennsylvania
in 1844. The first example of the <i>bones</i> of a reptile in the Coal
of North America was detected so lately as September, 1852, by Mr.
G. W. Dawson and myself in Nova Scotia. These remains, referred by
Messrs. Wyman and Owen to a perennibranchiate batrachian, were met
with in the interior of an erect fossil tree, apparently a sigillaria. They
seem clearly to have been introduced together with sediment into the
tree, during its submergence and after it had decayed and was standing
as a hollow cylinder of bark, this bark being now converted into coal.</p>

<p>When Agassiz, in his great work on fossil fish, described 152 species
of ichthyolites from the Coal, he found them to consist of 94 placoids,
belonging to the families of shark and ray, and 58 ganoids. One family
of the latter he called "sauroid fish," including the megalicthys and
holoptychius, often of great size, and all predaceous. Although true
fish, and not intermediate between that class and reptiles, they seem to
have been more highly organized than any living fish, reminding us of
the skeletons of saurians by the close suture of their cranial bones, their
large conical teeth, striated longitudinally, and the articulation of the
spinous processes with the vertebr&aelig;. Among living species they are
most nearly allied to the lepidosteus, or bony pike of the North American
rivers. Before the recent progress of discovery above alluded to
had shown the fallacy of such ideas, it was imagined by some geologists
that this ichthyic type was the more highly developed, because it
took the lead at the head of nature before the class of reptiles had been
created. The confident assumption indulged in till the year 1844, that
reptiles were first introduced into the earth in the Permian period, shows
the danger of taking for granted that the date of the creation of any
family of animals or plants in past time coincides with the age of the
oldest stratified rock in which the geologist has detected its remains.
Nevertheless, after repeated disappointments, we find some naturalists
as much disposed as ever to rely on such negative evidence, and to feel
now as sure that reptiles were not introduced into the earth till after
the Silurian epoch, as they were in 1844, that they appeared for the
first time at an era subsequent to the carboniferous.</p>

<p>Scanty as is the information hitherto obtained in regard to the articulata
of the coal formation, we have at least ascertained that some insects
winged their way through the ancient forests. In the ironstone
of Coalbrook Dale, two species of coleoptera of the Linn&aelig;an genus curculio
have been met with: and a neuropterous insect resembling a corydalis,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
together with another of the same order related to the phasmid&aelig;.
As an example of the insectivorous arachnid&aelig;, I may mention
the scorpion of the Bohemian coal, figured by Count Sternberg, in which
even the eyes, skin, and minute hairs were preserved.<a name="FNanchor_213" id="FNanchor_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> We need not
despair, therefore, of obtaining eventually fossil representatives of all
the principal orders of hexapods and arachnid&aelig; in carboniferous strata.</p>

<p>Next in chronological order above the Coal comes the allied Magnesian
Limestone, or Permian group, and the secondary formations from
the Trias to the Chalk inclusive. These rocks comprise the monuments
of a long series of ages in which reptiles of every variety of size, form,
and structure peopled the earth; so that the whole period, and especially
that of the Lias and Oolite, has been sometimes called "the age of reptiles."
As there are now mammalia entirely confined to the land; others
which, like the bat and vampire, fly in the air; others, again, of amphibious
habits, frequenting rivers, like the hippopotamus, otter, and beaver;
others exclusively aquatic and marine, like the seal, whale, and narwal;
so in the early ages under consideration, there were terrestrial, winged,
and aquatic reptiles. There were iguanodons walking on the land, pterodactyls
winging their way through the air, monitors and crocodiles in
the rivers, and ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs in the ocean. It appears
also that some of these ancient saurians approximated more nearly in
their organization to the type of living mammalia than do any of the
reptiles now existing.<a name="FNanchor_214" id="FNanchor_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a></p>

<p>In the vast range of strata above alluded to, comprising the Permian,
the Upper New Red Sandstone and Muschelkalk, the Lias, Oolite,
Wealden, Green-sand, and Chalk, scarcely any well-authenticated instances
of the occurrence of fossil birds in Europe are on record, and
only two or three of fossil mammalia.</p>

<p>In regard to the absence of birds, they are usually wanting, for reasons
afterwards to be explained (see chap. <a href="#Page_742">47</a>), in deposits of all ages,
even in the tertiary periods, where we know that birds as well as land
quadrupeds abounded. Some at least of the fossil remains formerly referred
to this class in the Wealden (a great freshwater deposit below
the chalk), have been recently shown by Mr. Owen to belong to pterodactyls.<a name="FNanchor_215" id="FNanchor_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
But in North America still more ancient indications of the
existence of the feathered tribe have been detected, the fossil foot-marks
of a great variety of species, of various sizes, some larger than the ostrich,
others smaller than the plover, having been observed. These bipeds
have left marks of their footsteps on strata of an age decidedly intermediate
between the Lias and the Coal.<a name="FNanchor_216" id="FNanchor_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p>The examples of mammalia, above alluded to, are confined to the Trias
and the Oolite. In the former, the evidence is as yet limited to two
small molar teeth, described by Professor Plieninger in 1847, under the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
generic name of Microlestes. They were found near Stuttgart, and possess
the double fangs so characteristic of mammalia.<a name="FNanchor_217" id="FNanchor_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> The other fossil
remains of the same class were derived from one of the inferior members
of the oolitic series in Oxfordshire, and afford more full and satisfactory
evidence, consisting of the lower jaws of three species of small quadrupeds
about the size of a mole. Cuvier, when he saw one of them (during
a visit to Oxford in 1818), referred it to the marsupial order, stating,
however, that it differed from all known carnivora in having ten molar
teeth in a row. Professor Owen afterwards pointed out that the jaw
belonged to an extinct genus, having considerable affinity to a newly
discovered Australian mammifer, the <i>Myrmecobius</i> of Waterhouse, which
has nine molar teeth in the lower jaw. (Fig. 9.) A more perfect specimen

enabled Mr. Owen in 1846 to
prove that the inflection of the angular
process of the lower jaw was
not sufficiently marked to entitle
the osteologist to infer that this
quadruped was marsupial, as the
process is not bent inwards in a
greater degree than in the mole or
hedgehog. Hence the genus amphitherium, of which there are two
species from Stonesfield, must be referred to the ordinary or placental
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
type of insectivorous mammals, although it approximates in some points
of structure to the myrmecobius and allied marsupials of Australia. The
other contemporary genus, called phascolotherium, agrees much more
nearly in osteological character and precisely in the number of the teeth
with the opossums; and is believed to have been truly marsupial.

<p>The occurrence of these most ancient memorials of the mammiferous
type, in so low a member of the oolitic series, while no other representatives
of the same class (if we except the microlestes) have yet been
found in any other of the inferior or superior secondary strata, is a
striking fact, and should serve as a warning to us against hasty generalizations,
founded solely on negative evidence. So important an exception
to a general rule may be perfectly consistent with the conclusion,
that a small number only of mammalia inhabited European latitudes
when our secondary rocks were formed; but it seems fatal to the theory
of progressive development, or to the notion that the order of precedence
in the creation of animals, considered chronologically, has precisely
coincided with the order in which they would be ranked according
to perfection or complexity of structure.</p>

<p>It was for many years suggested that the marsupial order to which
the fossil animals of Stonesfield were supposed exclusively to belong
constitutes the lowest grade in the class Mammalia, and that this order,
of which the brain is of more simple form, evinces an inferior degree of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
intelligence. If, therefore, in the oolitic period the marsupial tribes
were the only warm-blooded quadrupeds which had as yet appeared
upon our planet, the fact, it was said, confirmed the theory which
teaches that the creation of the more simple forms in each division of
the animal kingdom preceded that of the more complex. But on how
slender a support, even if the facts had continued to hold true, did such
important conclusions hang! The Australian continent, so far as it has
been hitherto explored, contains no indigenous quadrupeds save those
of the marsupial order, with the exception of a few small rodents, while
some neighboring islands to the north, and even southern Africa, in the
same latitude as Australia, abound in mammalia of every tribe except
the marsupial. We are entirely unable to explain on what physiological
or other laws this singular diversity in the habitations of living mammalia
depends; but nothing is more clear than that the causes which
stamp so peculiar a character on two different provinces of wide extent
are wholly independent of time, or of the age or maturity of the planet.</p>

<p>The strata of the Wealden, although of a later date than the oolite of
Stonesfield, and although filled with the remains of large reptiles, both
terrestrial and aquatic, have not yielded as yet a single marsupial bone.
Were we to assume on such scanty data that no warm-blooded quadrupeds
were then to be found throughout the northern hemisphere, there
would still remain a curious subject of speculation, whether the entire
suppression of one important class of vertebrata, such as the mammiferous,
and the great development of another, such as the reptilian, implies
a departure from fixed and uniform rules governing the fluctuations of
the animal world; such rules, for example, as appear from one century
to another to determine the growth of certain tribes of plants and animals
in arctic, and of other tribes in tropical regions.</p>

<p>In Australia, New Zealand, and many other parts of the southern
hemisphere, where the indigenous land quadrupeds are comparatively
few, and of small dimensions, the reptiles do not predominate in number
or size. The deposits formed at the mouth of an Australian river, within
the tropics, might contain the bones of only a few small marsupial animals,
which, like those of Stonesfield, might hereafter be discovered
with difficulty by geologists; but there would, at the same time, be no
megalosauri and other fossil remains, showing that large saurians were
plentiful on the land and in the waters at a time when mammalia were
scarce. This example, therefore, would afford a very imperfect parallel
to the state of the animal kingdom, supposed to have prevailed during
the secondary periods, when a high temperature pervaded European
latitudes.</p>

<p>It may nevertheless be advantageous to point to some existing anomalies
in the geographical development of distinct classes of vertebrata
which may be comparable to former conditions of the animal creation
brought to light by geology. Thus in the arctic regions, at present,
reptiles are small, and sometimes wholly wanting, where birds, large
land quadrupeds, and cetacea abound. We meet with bears, wolves,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
foxes, musk oxen, and deer, walruses, seals, whales, and narwals, in regions
of ice and snow, where the smallest snakes, efts, and frogs are
rarely, if ever, seen.</p>

<p>A still more anomalous state of things presents itself in the southern
hemisphere. Even in the temperate zone, between the latitudes 52&deg;
and 56&deg; S., as, for example, in Tierra del Fuego, as well as in the
woody region immediately north of the Straits of Magellan, and in the
Falkland Islands, no reptiles of any kind are met with, not even a snake,
lizard, or frog; but in these same countries we find the guanaco (a kind
of llama), a deer, the puma, a large species of fox, many small rodentia,
besides the seal and otter, together with the porpoise, whale, and other
cetacea.</p>

<p>On what grand laws in the animal physiology these remarkable phenomena
depend, cannot in the present state of science be conjectured;
nor could we predict whether any opposite condition of the atmosphere,
in respect to heat, moisture, and other circumstances, would bring about
a state of animal life which might be called the converse of that above
described, namely, a state in which reptiles of every size and order
might abound, and mammalia disappear.</p>

<p>The nearest approximation to such a fauna is found in the Galapagos
Archipelago. These islands, situated under the equator, and nearly
600 miles west of the coast of Peru, have been called "the land of reptiles,"
so great is the number of snakes, large tortoises, and lizards,
which they support. Among the lizards, the first living species proper
to the ocean has been discovered. Yet, although some of these islands
are from 3000 to 4000 feet high, and one of them 75 miles long, they
contain, with the exception of one small mouse, no indigenous mammifer.
Even here, however, it is true that in the neighboring sea there
are seals, and several kinds of cetacea.<a name="FNanchor_221" id="FNanchor_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<p>It may be unreasonable to look for a nearer analogy between the
fauna now existing in any part of the globe, and that which we can
show to have prevailed when our secondary strata were deposited, because
we must always recollect that a climate like that now experienced
at the equator, coexisting with the unequal days and nights of European
latitudes, was a state of things to which there is now no counterpart
on the globe. Consequently, the type of animal and vegetable
existence required for such a climate might be expected to deviate
almost as widely from that now established, as do the flora and fauna
of our tropical differ from those of our arctic regions.</p>

<p><i>In the Tertiary strata.</i>&mdash;The tertiary formations were deposited when
the physical geography of the northern hemisphere had been entirely
altered. Large inland lakes had become numerous, as in central France
and other countries. There were gulfs of the sea, into which considerable
rivers emptied themselves, and where strata like those of the Paris
basin were accumulated. There were also formations in progress, in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
shallow seas not far from shore, such as are indicated by portions of the
<i>Faluns</i> of the Loire, and the English <i>Crag</i>.</p>

<p>The proximity, therefore, of large tracts of dry land to the seas and
lakes then existing, may, in a great measure, explain why the remains
of land animals, so rare in the older strata, are not uncommon in these
more modern deposits. Yet even these have sometimes proved entirely
destitute of mammiferous relics for years after they had become
celebrated for the abundance of their fossil testacea, fish, and reptiles.
Thus the calcaire grossier, a marine limestone of the district round Paris,
had afforded to collectors more than 1100 species of shells, besides
many zoophytes, echinodermata, and the teeth of fish, before the bones
of one or two land quadrupeds were met with in the same rock. The
strata called London and Plastic clay in England have been studied for
more than half a century, and about 400 species of shells, 50 or more
of fish, besides several kinds of chelonian and saurian reptiles, were
known before a single mammifer was detected. At length, in the year
1839, there were found in this formation the remains of a monkey, an
opossum, a bat,<a name="FNanchor_222" id="FNanchor_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> and a species of the extinct genus Hyracotherium,
allied to the Peccary or hog tribe.</p>

<p>If we examine the strata above the London clay in England, we first
meet with mammiferous remains in the Isle of Wight, in beds also belonging
to the Eocene epoch, such as the remains of the Pal&aelig;otherium,
Anoplotherium, and other extinct quadrupeds, agreeing very closely
with those first found by Cuvier, near Paris, in strata of the same age,
and of similar freshwater origin.</p>

<p>In France we meet with another fauna, both conchological and mammalian
in the Miocene "faluns" of the Loire; above which in the
ascending series in Great Britain we arrive at the coralline crag of Suffolk,
a marine formation which has yielded three or four hundred species
of shells, very different from the Eocene testacea, and of which a large
proportion, although a minority of the whole number, are recent, besides
many corals, echini, foraminifera, and fish, but as yet no relic decidedly
mammalian except the ear-bone of a whale.</p>

<p>In the shelly sand, provincially termed "Red Crag," in Suffolk,
which immediately succeeds the coralline, constituting a newer member
of the same tertiary group, about 250 species of shells have been recognized,
of which a still larger proportion are recent. They are associated
with numerous teeth of fish; but no signs of a warm-blooded
quadruped had been detected until 1839, when the teeth of a leopard,
a bear, a hog, and a species of ruminant, were found at Newbourn, in
Suffolk, and since that time, several other genera of mammalia have
been met with in the same formation, or in the Red Crag.<a name="FNanchor_223" id="FNanchor_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>Of a still newer date is the Norwich Crag, a
fluvio-marine deposit of
the Pleiocene epoch, containing a mixture of marine, fluviatile, and land
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
shells, of which 90 per cent. or more are recent. These beds, since the
time of their first investigation, have yielded a supply of mammalian
bones of the genera mastodon, elephant, rhinoceros, pig, horse, deer, ox,
and others, the bodies of which may have been washed down into the
sea by rivers draining land, of which the contiguity is indicated by the
occasional presence of terrestrial and freshwater shells.</p>

<p>Our acquaintance with the newer Pleiocene mammalia in Europe,
South America, and Australia, is derived chiefly from cavern deposits, a
fact which we ought never to forget if we desire to appreciate the superior
facilities we enjoy for studying the more modern as compared to the
more ancient terrestrial faunas. We know nothing of the fossil bones
which must have been inclosed in the stalagmite of caverns in the older
Pleiocene, or in the Miocene or Eocene epochs, much less can we derive
any information respecting the inhabitants of the land from a similar
source, when we carry back our inquiries to the Wealden or carboniferous
epochs. We are as well assured that land and rivers then existed, as that
they exist now; but it is evident that even a slight geographical revolution,
accompanied by the submergence and denudation of land, would reduce
to an extreme improbability the chance of our hitting on those minute
points of space where caves may once have occurred in limestone rocks.</p>

<p><i>Fossil quadrumana.</i>&mdash;Until within a few years (1836, 1837), not a
single bone of any quadrumanous animal, such as the orang, ape, baboon,
and monkey, had been discovered in a fossil state, although so much
progress had been made in bringing to light the extinct mammalia of
successive tertiary eras, both carnivorous and herbivorous. The total
absence of these anthropomorphous tribes among the records of a former
world, had led some to believe that the type of organization most nearly
resembling the human, came so late in the order of creation, as to be
scarcely, if at all, anterior to that of man. That such generalizations
were premature, I endeavored to point out in the first edition of this
work,<a name="FNanchor_224" id="FNanchor_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> in which I stated that the bones of quadrupeds hitherto met with
in tertiary deposits were chiefly those which frequent marshes, rivers, or
the borders of lakes, as the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, tapir,
hog, deer, and ox, while species which live in trees are extremely rare in
a fossil state. I also hinted, that we had as yet no data for determining
how great a number of the one kind we ought to find, before we have
a right to expect a single individual of the other. Lastly, I observed
that the climate of the more modern (or Post-Eocene) tertiary periods
in England was not tropical, and that in regard to the London clay, of
which the crocodiles, turtles, and fossil fruits implied a climate hot enough
for the quadrumana, we had as yet made too little progress in ascertaining
what were the Eocene pachydermata of England, to entitle us to expect
to have discovered any quadrumana of the same date.</p>

<p>Since those remarks were first written, in 1829, a great number of
extinct species have been added to our collections of tertiary mammalia
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
from Great Britain and other parts of the world. At length, between
the years 1836 and 1839, a few remains of quadrumana were found in
France and England, India and Brazil. Those of India, belonging to
more than one extinct species of monkey, were first discovered near the
Sutlej, in lat. 30&deg; N., in tertiary strata, of which the age is not yet determined;
the Brazilian fossil, brought from the basin of the Rio das
Velhas, about lat. 18&deg; S., is referable to a form now peculiar in America,
allied to the genus Callithrix, the species being extinct. The skull and
other bones met with in the South of France belong to a gibbon, or one
of the tailless apes, which stand next in the scale of organization to the
orang. It occurred at Sansan, about forty miles west of Toulouse, in
lat. 43&deg; 40' N., in freshwater strata, probably of the Miocene or middle
tertiary period. Lastly, the English quadrumane first met with, occurred
in a more ancient stratum than the rest, and at a point more remote
from the equator. It belongs to the genus Macacus, is an extinct species,
and was found in Suffolk, in lat. 52&deg;,<a name="FNanchor_225" id="FNanchor_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> in the London clay, the fossils of
which, such as crocodiles, turtles, shells of the genus Nautilus, and many
curious fruits, had already led geologists to the conclusion that the
climate of that era (the Eocene) was warm and nearly tropical.</p>

<p>Some years later (in 1846) the jaw of another British species of fossil
monkey, Macacus pliocenus, was announced by Mr. Owen as having
been met with in the newer Pleiocene strata, on the banks of the
Thames, at Grays, in Essex, accompanying the remains of hippopotamus,
elephant, and other quadrupeds, and associated with freshwater and
land shells, most of which are now inhabitants of the British
Isles.<a name="FNanchor_226" id="FNanchor_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a></p>

<p>When we consider the small area of the earth's surface hitherto explored
geologically, and the new discoveries brought to light daily,
even in the environs of great European capitals, we must feel that
it would be rash to assume that the Lower Eocene deposits mark the
era of the first creation of quadrumana. It would, however, be still
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
more unphilosophical to infer, as some writers have done, from a single
extinct species of this family obtained in a latitude far from the tropics,
that the Eocene quadrumana did not attain as high a grade of organization
as they do in our own times. What would the naturalist know of
the apes and orangs now contemporary with man, if our investigations
were restricted to such northern latitudes as those where alone the geologist
has hitherto found all the fossil quadrumana of Europe?</p>

<p><i>Cetacea.</i>&mdash;The absence of Cetacea from rocks older than the Eocene
has been frequently adduced as lending countenance to the theory of
the very late appearance of the highest class of Vertebrata on the
earth. Professor Sedgwick possesses in the Cambridge Museum a mass
of anchylosed cervical vertebr&aelig; of a whale, which he found in drift
clay near Ely, and which he has no doubt was washed out of the Kimmeridge
clay, an upper member of the Oolite. According to Professor
Owen, it exhibits well-marked specific characters, distinguishing it from
all other known recent or fossil cetacea. Dr. Leidy, of Philadelphia,
has lately described (1851) two species of cetacea of a new genus,
which he has called Priscodelphinus from the green sand of New Jersey,
which corresponds in age with the English Chalk or the cretaceous
strata above the gault. The specimens consist of dorsal and cervical
vertebr&aelig;.<a name="FNanchor_227" id="FNanchor_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> Even in the Eocene strata of Europe, the discovery of
cetaceans has never kept pace with that of land quadrupeds. The only
instance cited in Great Britain is a species of Monodon, from the London
clay, of doubtful authenticity as to its geological position. On the
other hand, the gigantic Zeuglodon of North America occurs abundantly
in the Middle Eocene strata of Georgia and Alabama, from which as
yet no bones of land quadrupeds have been obtained.</p>

<p>In the present imperfect state then of our information, we can scarcely
say more than that the cetacea seem to have been scarce in the secondary
and primary periods. It is quite conceivable that when aquatic saurians,
some of them carnivorous, like the Ichthyosaurus, were swarming in the
sea, and when there were large herbivorous reptiles, like the Iguanodon,
on the land, the class of reptiles may, to a certain extent, have superseded
the cetacea, and discharged their functions in the animal economy.</p>

<p>That mammalia had been created long before the epoch of the Kimmeridge
clay, is shown by the Microlestes of the Trias before alluded
to, and by the Stonesfield quadrupeds from the Inferior Oolite. And
we are bound to remember, whenever we infer the poverty of the flora
or fauna of any given period of the past, from the small number of fossils
occurring in ancient rocks, that it has been evidently no part of the
plan of Nature to hand down to us a complete or systematic record of
the former history of the animate world. We may have failed to discover
a single shell, marine or freshwater, or a single coral or bone in
certain sandstones, such as that of the valley of the Connecticut, where
the footprints of bipeds and quadrupeds abound; but such failure may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
have arisen, not because the population of the land or sea was scanty at
that era, but because in general the preservation of any relics of the
animals or plants of former times is the exception to a general rule.
Time so enormous as that contemplated by the geologist may multiply
exceptional cases till they seem to constitute the rule, and so impose on
the imagination as to lead us to infer the non-existence of creatures of
which no monuments happen to remain. Professor Forbes has remarked,
that few geologists are aware how large a proportion of all
known species of fossils are founded on single specimens, while a still
greater number are founded on a few individuals discovered in one spot.
This holds true not only in regard to animals and plants inhabiting the
land, the lake, and the river, but even to a surprising number of the
marine mollusca, articulata, and radiata. Our knowledge, therefore, of
the living creation of any given period of the past may be said to depend
in a great degree on what we commonly call chance, and the casual
discovery of some new localities rich in peculiar fossils may modify
or entirely overthrow all our previous generalizations.</p>

<p>Upon the whole then we derive this result from a general review of
the fossils of the successive tertiary strata, namely, that since the Eocene
period, there have been several great changes in the land quadrupeds
inhabiting Europe, probably not less than five complete revolutions,
during which there has been no step whatever made in advance, no elevation
in the scale of being; so that had man been created at the commencement
of the Eocene era, he would not have constituted a greater
innovation on the state of the animal creation previously established than
now, when we believe him to have begun to exist at the close of the
Pleiocene. The views, therefore, which I proposed in the first edition
of this work, January, 1830, in opposition to the theory of progressive
development, do not seem to me to require material modification, notwithstanding
the large additions since made to our knowledge of fossil
remains.</p>

<p>These views may be thus briefly stated. From the earliest period at
which plants and animals can be proved to have existed, there has been
a continual change going on in the position of land and sea, accompanied
by great fluctuations of climate. To these ever-varying geographical
and climatal conditions the state of the animate world has been unceasingly
adapted. No satisfactory proof has yet been discovered of
the gradual passage of the earth from a chaotic to a more habitable
state, nor of any law of progressive development governing the extinction
and renovation of species, and causing the fauna and flora to pass
from an embryonic to a more perfect condition, from a simple to a more
complex organization.</p>

<p>The principle of adaptation to which I have alluded, appears to have
been analogous to that which now peoples the arctic, temperate, and
tropical regions contemporaneously with distinct assemblages of species
and genera, or which, independently of mere temperature, gives rise to
a predominance of the marsupial or didelphous tribe of quadrupeds in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Australia, of the placental or monodelphous tribe in Asia and Europe,
or which causes a profusion of reptiles without mammalia in the Galapagos
Archipelago, and of mammalia without reptiles in Greenland.</p>

<p><i>Recent origin of man.</i>&mdash;If, then, the popular theory of the successive
development of the animal and vegetable world, from the simplest to
the most perfect forms, rests on a very insecure foundation; it may
be asked, whether the recent origin of man lends any support to the
same doctrine, or how far the influence of man may be considered as
such a deviation from the analogy of the order of things previously established,
as to weaken our confidence in the uniformity of the course
of nature.</p>

<p>Antecedently to investigation, we might reasonably have anticipated
that the vestiges of man would have been traced back at least as far as
those modern strata in which all the testacea and a certain number of
the mammalia are of existing species, for of all the mammalia the human
species is the most cosmopolite, and perhaps more capable than
any other of surviving considerable vicissitudes in climate, and in the
physical geography of the globe.</p>

<p>No inhabitant of the land exposes himself to so many dangers on the
waters as man, whether in a savage or a civilized state;<a name="FNanchor_228" id="FNanchor_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> and there is
no animal, therefore, whose skeleton is so liable to become imbedded in
lacustrine or submarine deposits; nor can it be said that his remains
are more perishable than those of other animals; for in ancient fields
of battle, as Cuvier has observed, the bones of men have suffered
as little decomposition as those of horses which were buried in the
same grave.<a name="FNanchor_229" id="FNanchor_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> But even if the more solid parts of our species had disappeared,
the impression of their form would have remained engraven
on the rocks, as have the traces of the tenderest leaves of plants, and
the soft integuments of many animals. Works of art, moreover, composed
of the most indestructible materials, would have outlasted almost
all the organic contents of sedimentary rocks. Edifices, and even
entire cities, have, within the times of history, been buried under volcanic
ejections, submerged beneath the sea, or engulfed by earthquakes;
and had these catastrophes been repeated throughout an indefinite
lapse of ages, the high antiquity of man would have been inscribed in
far more legible characters on the framework of the globe than are the
forms of the ancient vegetation which once covered the islands of the
northern ocean, or of those gigantic reptiles which at still later periods
peopled the seas and rivers of the northern hemisphere.<a name="FNanchor_230" id="FNanchor_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>Dr. Prichard has argued that the human race have not always existed
on the surface of the earth, because "the strata of which our continents
are composed were once a part of the ocean's bed"&mdash;"mankind
had a beginning, since we can look back to the period when the surface
on which they lived began to exist."<a name="FNanchor_231" id="FNanchor_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> This proof, however, is insufficient,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
for many thousands of human beings now dwell in various quarters
of the globe where marine species lived within the times of history,
and, on the other hand, the sea now prevails permanently over large
districts once inhabited by thousands of human beings. Nor can this
interchange of sea and land ever cease while the present causes are in
existence. Terrestrial species, therefore, might be older than the continents
which they inhabit, and aquatic species of higher antiquity than
the lakes and seas which they now people.</p>

<p>But so far as our interpretation of physical movements has yet gone,
we have every reason to infer that the human race is extremely modern,
even when compared to the larger number of species now our contemporaries
on the earth, and we may, therefore, ask whether his creation
can be considered as one step in a supposed progressive system, by
which the organic world has advanced slowly from a more simple to a
more complex and perfect state? If we concede, for a moment, the
truth of the proposition, that the sponge, the cephalopod, the fish, the
reptile, the bird, and the mammifer, have followed each other in regular
chronological order, the creation of each class being separated from
the other by vast intervals of time, should we be able to recognize, in
man's entrance upon the earth, the last term of one and the same series
of progressive developments?</p>

<p>In reply to this question it should first be observed, that the superiority
of man depends not on those faculties and attributes which he
shares in common with the inferior animals, but on his reason, by which
he is distinguished from them. When it is said that the human race
is of far higher dignity than were any pre-existing beings on the earth,
it is the intellectual and moral attributes of our race, rather than the
physical, which are considered; and it is by no means clear that the
organization of man is such as would confer a decided pre-eminence
upon him, if, in place of his reasoning powers, he was merely provided
with such instincts as are possessed by the lower animals.</p>

<p>If this be admitted, it would not follow, even if there were sufficient
geological evidence in favor of the theory of progressive development,
that the creation of man was the last link in the same chain. For the
sudden passage from an irrational to a rational animal, is a phenomenon
of a distinct kind from the passage from the more simple to the
more perfect forms of animal organization and instinct. To pretend
that such a step, or rather leap, can be part of a regular series of
changes in the animal world, is to strain analogy beyond all reasonable
bounds.</p>

<p><i>Introduction of man, to what extent a change in the system.</i>&mdash;But
setting aside the question of progressive development, another and a
far more difficult one may arise out of the admission that man is comparatively
of modern origin. Is not the interference of the human species,
it may be asked, such a deviation from the antecedent course of
physical events, that the knowledge of such a fact tends to destroy all
our confidence in the uniformity of the order of nature, both in regard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
to time past and future? If such an innovation could take place after
the earth had been exclusively inhabited for thousands of ages by inferior
animals, why should not other changes as extraordinary and unprecedented
happen from time to time? If one new cause was permitted
to supervene, differing in kind and energy from any before in operation,
why may not others have come into action at different epochs? Or
what security have we that they may not arise hereafter? And if such
be the case, how can the experience of one period, even though we are
acquainted with all the possible effects of the then existing causes, be a
standard to which we can refer all natural phenomena of other periods?</p>

<p>Now these objections would be unanswerable, if adduced against one
who was contending for the absolute uniformity throughout all time of
the succession of sublunary events&mdash;if, for example, he was disposed to
indulge in the philosophical reveries of some Egyptian and Greek sects,
who represented all the changes both of the moral and material world
as repeated at distant intervals, so as to follow each other in their former
connection of place and time. For they compared the course of
events on our globe to astronomical cycles; and not only did they consider
all sublunary affairs to be under the influence of the celestial bodies,
but they taught that on the earth, as well as in the heavens, the
same identical phenomena recurred again and again in a perpetual vicissitude.
The same individual men were doomed to be re-born, and to
perform the same actions as before; the same arts were to be invented,
and the same cities built and destroyed. The Argonautic expedition
was destined to sail again with the same heroes, and Achilles with his
Myrmidons to renew, the combat before the walls of Troy.</p>

<p>
Alter erit tum Tiphys, et altera qu&aelig; vehat Argo
Dilectos heroas; erunt etiam altera bella,
Atque iterum ad Trojam magnus mittetur Achilles.<a name="FNanchor_232" id="FNanchor_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>
</p>

<p>The geologist, however, may condemn these tenets as absurd, without
running into the opposite extreme, and denying that the order of
nature has, from the earliest periods, been uniform in the same sense in
which we believe it to be uniform at present, and expect it to remain so
in future. We have no reason to suppose, that when man first became
master of a small part of the globe, a greater change took place in its
physical condition than is now experienced when districts, never before
inhabited, become successively occupied by new settlers. When a
powerful European colony lands on the shores of Australia, and introduces
at once those arts which it has required many centuries to mature;
when it imports a multitude of plants and large animals from the
opposite extremity of the earth, and begins rapidly to extirpate many of
the indigenous species, a mightier revolution is effected in a brief period
than the first entrance of a savage horde, or their continued occupation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
of the country for many centuries, can possibly be imagined to have
produced. If there be no impropriety in assuming that the system is
uniform when disturbances so unprecedented occur in certain localities,
we can with much greater confidence apply the same language to those
primeval ages when the aggregate number and power of the human
race, or the rate of their advancement in civilization, must be supposed
to have been far inferior. In reasoning on the state of the globe immediately
before our species was called into existence, we must be guided
by the same rules of induction as when we speculate on the state of
America in the interval that elapsed between the introduction of man
into Asia, the supposed cradle of our race, and the arrival of the first
adventurers on the shores of the New World. In that interval, we imagine
the state of things to have gone on according to the order now
observed in regions unoccupied by man. Even now, the waters of
lakes, seas, and the great ocean, which teem with life, may be said to
have no immediate relation to the human race&mdash;to be portions of the
terrestrial system of which man has never taken, nor ever can take possession;
so that the greater part of the inhabited surface of the planet
may still remain as insensible to our presence as before any isle or continent
was appointed to be our residence.</p>

<p>If the barren soil around Sydney had at once become fertile upon the
landing of our first settlers; if, like the happy isles whereof the poets
have given such glowing descriptions, those sandy tracts had begun to
yield spontaneously an annual supply of grain, we might then, indeed,
have fancied alterations still more remarkable in the economy of nature
to have attended the first coming of our species into the planet. Or if,
when a volcanic island like Ischia was, for the first time, brought under
cultivation by the enterprise and industry of a Greek colony, the internal
fire had become dormant, and the earthquake had remitted its destructive
violence, there would then have been some ground for speculating
on the debilitation of the subterranean forces, when the earth was
first placed under the dominion of man. But after a long interval of
rest, the volcano bursts forth again with renewed energy, annihilates
one half of the inhabitants, and compels the remainder to emigrate.
The course of nature remains evidently unchanged; and, in like manner,
we may suppose the general condition of the globe, immediately before
and after the period when our species first began to exist, to have been
the same, with the exception only of man's presence.</p>

<p>The modifications in the system of which man is the instrument do
not, perhaps, constitute so great a deviation from previous analogy as
we usually imagine; we often, for example, form an exaggerated estimate
of the extent of our power in extirpating some of the inferior animals,
and causing others to multiply; a power which is circumscribed
within certain limits, and which, in all likelihood, is by no means exclusively
exerted by our species.<a name="FNanchor_233" id="FNanchor_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> The growth of human population cannot
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
take place without diminishing the numbers, or causing the entire
destruction, of many animals. The larger beasts of prey, in particular,
give way before us; but other quadrupeds of smaller size, and innumerable
birds, insects, and plants, which are inimical to our interests, increase
in spite of us, some attacking our food, others our raiment and
persons, and others interfering with our agricultural and horticultural
labors. We behold the rich harvest which we have raised by the sweat
of our brow, devoured by myriads of insects, and are often as incapable
of arresting their depredations, as of staying the shock of an earthquake,
or the course of a stream of lava.</p>

<p>A great philosopher has observed, that we can command nature only
by obeying her laws; and this principle is true even in regard to the
astonishing changes which are superinduced in the qualities of certain
animals and plants by domestication and garden culture. I shall point
out in the third book that we can only effect such surprising alterations
by assisting the development of certain instincts, or by availing ourselves
of that mysterious law of their organization, by which individual peculiarities
are transmissible from one generation to another.<a name="FNanchor_234" id="FNanchor_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

<p>It is probable from these and many other considerations, that as we
enlarge our knowledge of the system, we shall become more and more
convinced, that the alterations caused by the interference of man deviate
far less from the analogy of those effected by other animals than is
usually supposed.<a name="FNanchor_235" id="FNanchor_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> We are often misled, when we institute such comparisons,
by our knowledge of the wide distinction between the instincts
of animals and the reasoning power of man; and we are apt hastily to
infer, that the effects of a rational and irrational species, considered
merely as <i>physical agents</i>, will differ almost as much as the faculties by
which their actions are directed.</p>

<p>It is not, however, intended that a real departure from the antecedent
course of physical events cannot be traced in the introduction of man.
If that latitude of action which enables the brutes to accommodate
themselves in some measure to accidental circumstances could be imagined
to have been at any former period so great, that the operations
of instinct were as much diversified as are those of human reason, it
might, perhaps, be contended, that the agency of man did not constitute
an anomalous deviation from the previously established order of
things. It might then have been said, that the earth's becoming at a
particular period the residence of human beings, was an era in the
moral, not in the physical world&mdash;that our study and contemplation
of the earth, and the laws which govern its animate productions, ought
no more to be considered in the light of a disturbance or deviation from
the system, than the discovery of the satellites of Jupiter should be
regarded as a physical event affecting those heavenly bodies. Their
influence in advancing the progress of science among men, and in aiding
navigation and commerce, was accompanied by no reciprocal action
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
of the human mind upon the economy of nature in those distant planets;
and so the earth might be conceived to have become, at a certain period,
a place of moral discipline and intellectual improvement to man,
without the slightest derangement of a previously existing order of
change in its animate and inanimate productions.</p>

<p>The distinctness, however, of the human from all other species, considered
merely as an efficient cause in the physical world, is real; for
we stand in a relation to contemporary species of animals and plants
widely different from that which other irrational animals can ever be
supposed to have held to each other. We modify their instincts, relative
numbers, and geographical distribution, in a manner superior in
degree, and in some respects very different in kind from that in which
any other species can affect the rest. Besides, the progressive movement
of each successive generation of men causes the human species
to differ more from itself in power at two distant periods, than any
one species of the higher order of animals differs from another. The
establishment, therefore, by geological evidence, of the first intervention
of such a peculiar and unprecedented agency, long after other parts
of the animate and inanimate world existed, affords ground for concluding
that the experience during thousands of ages of all the events
which may happen on this globe, would not enable a philosopher to
speculate with confidence concerning future contingencies.</p>

<p>If, then, an intelligent being, after observing the order of events
for an indefinite series of ages, had witnessed at last so wonderful an
innovation as this, to what extent would his belief in the regularity of
the system be weakened?&mdash;would he cease to assume that there was
permanency in the laws of nature?&mdash;would he no longer be guided
in his speculations by the strictest rules of induction? To these questions
it may be answered, that, had he previously presumed to dogmatize
respecting the absolute uniformity of the order of nature, he
would undoubtedly be checked by witnessing this new and unexpected
event, and would form a more just estimate of the limited range of his
own knowledge, and the unbounded extent of the scheme of the universe.
But he would soon perceive that no one of the fixed and constant
laws of the animate or inanimate world was subverted by human
agency, and that the modifications now introduced for the first time
were the accompaniments of new and extraordinary circumstances,
and those not of a <i>physical</i> but a <i>moral</i> nature. The deviation permitted
would also appear to be as slight as was consistent with the
accomplishment of the new <i>moral</i> ends proposed, and to be in a great
degree temporary in its nature, so that, whenever the power of the
new agent was withheld, even for a brief period, a relapse would take
place to the ancient state of things; the domesticated animal, for example,
recovering in a few generations its wild instinct, and the
garden-flower and fruit-tree reverting to the likeness of the parent stock.</p>

<p>Now, if it would be reasonable to draw such inferences with respect
to the future, we cannot but apply the same rules of induction to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
past. We have no right to anticipate any modifications in the results
of existing causes in time to come, which are not conformable to analogy,
unless they be produced by the progressive development of human
power, or perhaps by some other new relations which may hereafter
spring up between the moral and material worlds. In the same manner,
when we speculate on the vicissitudes of the animate and inanimate
creation in former ages, we ought not to look for any anomalous results,
unless where man has interfered, or unless clear indications appear of
some other <i>moral</i> source of temporary derangement.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER X.</h4>

<h6>SUPPOSED INTENSITY OF AQUEOUS FORCES AT REMOTE PERIODS.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Intensity of aqueous causes&mdash;Slow accumulation of strata proved by fossils&mdash;Rate
of denudation can only keep pace with deposition&mdash;Erratics, and effects of ice&mdash;Deluges,
and the causes to which they are referred&mdash;Supposed universality of
ancient deposits.</p></div>

<p><i>Intensity of aqueous causes.</i>&mdash;The great problem considered in the
preceding chapters, namely, whether the former changes of the earth
made known to us by geology, resemble in kind and degree those now
in daily progress, may still be contemplated from several other points of
view. We may inquire, for example, whether there are any grounds
for the belief entertained by many, that the intensity both of aqueous
and of igneous forces, in remote ages, far exceeded that which we witness
in our own times.</p>

<p>First, then, as to aqueous causes: it has been shown, in our history
of the science, that Woodward did not hesitate, in 1695, to teach that
the entire mass of fossiliferous strata contained in the earth's crust had
been deposited in a few months; and, consequently, as their mechanical
and derivative origin was already admitted, the reduction of rocky
masses into mud, sand, and pebbles, the transportation of the same to
a distance, and their accumulation elsewhere in regular strata, were all
assumed to have taken place with a rapidity unparalleled in modern
times. This doctrine was modified by degrees, in proportion as different
classes of organic remains, such as shells, corals, and fossil plants, had
been studied with attention. Analogy led every naturalist to assume,
that each full-grown individual of the animal or vegetable kingdom, had
required a certain number of months or years for the attainment of maturity,
and the perpetuation of its species by generation; and thus the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
first approach was made to the conception of a common standard of
time, without which there are no means whatever of measuring the
comparative rate at which any succession of events has taken place at
two distinct periods. This standard consisted of the average duration
of the lives of individuals of the same genera or families in the animal
and vegetable kingdoms; and the multitude of fossils dispersed through
successive strata implied the continuance of the same species for many
generations. At length the idea that species themselves had had a
limited duration, arose out of the observed fact that sets of strata of different
ages contained fossils of distinct species. Finally, the opinion
became general, that in the course of ages, one assemblage of animals
and plants had disappeared after another again and again, and new
tribes had started into life to replace them.</p>

<p><i>Denudation.</i>&mdash;In addition to the proofs derived from organic remains,
the forms of stratification led also, on a fuller investigation, to the belief
that sedimentary rocks had been slowly deposited; but it was still supposed
that <i>denudation</i>, or the power of running water, and the waves
and currents of the ocean, to strip off superior strata, and lay bare the
rocks below, had formerly operated with an energy wholly unequalled
in our times. These opinions were both illogical and inconsistent, because
deposition and denudation are parts of the same process, and
what is true of the one must be true of the other. Their speed must
be always limited by the same causes, and the conveyance of solid matter
to a particular region can only keep pace with its removal from another,
so that the aggregate of sedimentary strata in the earth's crust
can never exceed in volume the amount of solid matter which has been
ground down and washed away by running water. How vast, then,
must be the spaces which this abstraction of matter has left vacant!
how far exceeding in dimensions all the valleys, however numerous, and
the hollows, however vast, which we can prove to have been cleared out
by aqueous erosion! The evidences of the work of denudation are defective,
because it is the nature of every destroying cause to obliterate
the signs of its own agency; but the amount of reproduction in the form
of sedimentary strata must always afford a true measure of the minimum
of denudation which the earth's surface has undergone.</p>

<p><i>Erratics.</i>&mdash;The next phenomenon to which the advocates of the
excessive power of running water in times past have appealed, is the
enormous size of the blocks called <i>erratic</i>, which lie scattered over the
northern parts of Europe and North America. Unquestionably a large
proportion of these blocks have been transported far from their original
position, for between them and the parent rocks we now find, not unfrequently,
deep seas and valleys intervening, or hills more than a thousand
feet high. To explain the present situation of such travelled fragments,
a deluge of mud has been imagined by some to have come from the
north, bearing along with it sand, gravel, and stony fragments, some of
them hundreds of tons in weight. This flood, in its transient passage
over the continents, dispersed the boulders irregularly over hill, valley,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
and plain; or forced them along over a surface of hard rock, so as to
polish it and leave it indented with parallel scratches and grooves&mdash;such
markings as are still visible in the rocks of Scandinavia, Scotland, Canada,
and many other countries.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the myriads of angular and rounded blocks
above alluded to, cannot have been borne along by ordinary rivers or
marine currents, so great is their volume and weight, and so clear are
the signs, in many places, of time having been occupied in their successive
deposition; for they are often distributed at various depths through
heaps of regularly stratified sand and gravel. No waves of the sea
raised by earthquakes, nor the bursting of lakes dammed up for a time
by landslips or by avalanches of snow, can account for the observed
facts; but I shall endeavor to show, in the next book, chap. 15,<a name="FNanchor_236" id="FNanchor_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> that
a combination of existing causes may have conveyed erratics into their
present situations.</p>

<p>The causes which will be referred to are, first, the carrying power of
ice, combined with that of running water; and second, the upward
movement of the bed of the sea, converting it gradually into land.
Without entering at present into any details respecting these causes,
I may mention that the transportation of blocks by ice is now simultaneously
in progress in the cold and temperate latitudes, both of the
northern and southern hemisphere, as, for example, on the coasts of Canada
and Gulf of St. Lawrence, and also in Chili, Patagonia, and the
island of South Georgia. In those regions the uneven bed of the ocean
is becoming strewed over with ice-drifted fragments, which have either
stranded on shoals, or been dropped in deep water by melting bergs. The
entanglement of boulders in drift-ice will also be shown to occur annually
in North America, and these stones, when firmly frozen into ice, wander
year after year from Labrador to the St. Lawrence, and reach points of
the western hemisphere farther south than any part of Great Britain.</p>

<p>The general absence of erratics in the warmer parts of the equatorial
regions of Asia, Africa, and America, confirms the same views. As to
the polishing and grooving of hard rocks, it has lately been ascertained
that glaciers give rise to these effects when pushing forward sand, pebbles,
and rocky fragments, and causing them to grate along the bottom.
Nor can there be any reasonable doubt that icebergs, when they run
aground on the floor of the ocean, must imprint similar marks upon it.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary, therefore, to refer to deluges, or even to speculate
on the former existence of a climate more severe than that now prevailing
in the western hemisphere, to explain the geographical distribution
of most of the European erratics.</p>

<p><i>Deluges.</i>&mdash;As deluges have been often alluded to, I shall say something
of the causes which may be supposed to give rise to these grand
movements of water in addition to those already alluded to (p. 9).
Geologists who believe that mountain-chains have been thrown up suddenly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
at many successive epochs, imagine that the waters of the ocean
may be raised by these convulsions, and then break in terrific waves upon
the land, sweeping over whole continents, hollowing out valleys, and
transporting sand, gravel, and erratics, to great distances. The sudden
rise of the Alps or Andes, it is said, may have produced a flood even
subsequently to the time when the earth became the residence of man.
But it seems strange that none of the writers who have indulged their
imaginations in conjectures of this kind, should have ascribed a deluge
to the sudden conversion of part of the unfathomable ocean into a shoal
rather than to the rise of mountain-chains. In the latter case, the
mountains themselves could do no more than displace a certain quantity
of atmospheric air, whereas, the instantaneous formation of the shoal
would displace a vast body of water, which being heaved up to a great
height might roll over and permanently submerge a large portion of a
continent.</p>

<p>If we restrict ourselves to combinations of causes at present known,
it would seem that the two principal sources of extraordinary inundations
are, first, the escape of the waters of a large lake raised far above
the sea; and, secondly, the pouring down of a marine current into lands
depressed below the mean level of the ocean.</p>

<p>As an example of the first of these cases, we may take Lake Superior,
which is more than 400 geographical miles in length and about 150 in
breadth, having an average depth of from 500 to 900 feet. The surface
of this vast body of fresh water is no less than 600 feet above the
level of the ocean; the lowest part of the barrier which separates the
lake on its southwest side from those streams which flow into the head
waters of the Mississippi being about 600 feet high. If, therefore, a
series of subsidences should lower any part of this barrier 600 feet, any
subsequent rending or depression, even of a few yards at a time, would
allow the sudden escape of vast floods of water into a hydrographical
basin of enormous extent. If the event happened in the dry season,
when the ordinary channels of the Mississippi and its tributaries are in a
great degree empty, the inundation might not be considerable; but if in
the flood-season, a region capable of supporting a population of many
millions might be suddenly submerged. But even this event would be
insufficient to cause a violent rush of water, and to produce those effects
usually called diluvial; for the difference of level of 600 feet between
Lake Superior and the Gulf of Mexico, when distributed over a distance
of 1800 miles, would give an average fall of only four inches per mile.</p>

<p>The second case before adverted to is where there are large tracts of
dry land beneath the mean level of the ocean. It seems, after much
controversy, to be at length a settled point, that the Caspian is really
83 feet 6 inches lower than the Black Sea. As the Caspian covers an
area about equal to that of Spain, and as its shores are in general low
and flat, there must be many thousand square miles of country less than
83 feet above the level of that inland sea, and consequently depressed
below the Black Sea and Mediterranean. This area includes the site of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
the populous city of Astrakhan and other towns. Into this region the
ocean would pour its waters, if the land now intervening between the
Sea of Azof and the Caspian should subside. Yet even if this event
should occur, it is most probable that the submergence of the whole
region would not be accomplished simultaneously, but by a series of
minor floods, the sinking of the barrier being gradual.<a name="FNanchor_237" id="FNanchor_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p><i>Supposed universality of ancient deposits.</i>&mdash;The next fallacy which
has helped to perpetuate the doctrine that the operations of water were
on a different and grander scale in ancient times, is founded on the indefinite
areas over which homogeneous deposits were supposed to extend.
No modern sedimentary strata, it is said, equally identical in mineral
character and fossil contents, can be traced continuously from one quarter
of the globe to another. But the first propagators of these opinions
were very slightly acquainted with the inconstancy in mineral composition
of the ancient formations, and equally so of the wide spaces over
which the same kind of sediment is now actually distributed by rivers
and currents in the course of centuries. The persistency of character
in the older series was exaggerated, its extreme variability in the newer
was assumed without proof. In the chapter which treats of river-deltas
and the dispersion of sediment by currents, and in the description of
reefs of coral now growing over areas many hundred miles in length, I
shall have opportunities of convincing the reader of the danger of hasty
generalizations on this head.</p>

<p>In regard to the imagined universality of particular rocks of ancient
date, it was almost unavoidable that this notion, when once embraced,
should be perpetuated; for the same kinds of rock have occasionally
been reproduced at successive epochs; and when once the
agreement or disagreement in mineral character alone was relied on as
the test of age, it followed that similar rocks, if found even at the
antipodes, were referred to the same era, until the contrary could be
shown.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
Now it is usually impossible to combat such an assumption on geological
grounds, so long as we are imperfectly acquainted with the order
of superposition and the organic remains of these same formations.
Thus, for example, a group of red marl and red sandstone, containing
salt and gypsum, being interposed in England between the Lias and the
Coal, all other red marls and sandstones, associated some of them with
salt, and others with gypsum, and occurring not only in different parts of
Europe, but in North America, Peru, India, the salt deserts of Asia,
those of Africa&mdash;in a word, in every quarter of the globe, were referred
to one and the same period. The burden of proof was not supposed to
rest with those who insisted on the identity in age of all these groups&mdash;their
identity in mineral composition was thought sufficient. It was in
vain to urge as an objection the improbability of the hypothesis which
implies that all the moving waters on the globe were once simultaneously
charged with sediment of a red color.</p>

<p>But the rashness of pretending to identify, in age, all the red sandstones
and marls in question, has at length been sufficiently exposed, by
the discovery that, even in Europe, they belong decidedly to many different
epochs. It is already ascertained, that the red sandstone and red
marl containing the rock-salt of Cardona in Catalonia is newer than the
Oolitic, if not more modern than the Cretaceous period. It is also
known that certain red marls and variegated sandstones in Auvergne
which are undistinguishable in mineral composition from the New Red
Sandstone of English geologists, belong, nevertheless, to the Eocene
period; and, lastly, the gypseous red marl of Aix, in Provence, formerly
supposed to be a marine secondary group, is now acknowledged
to be a tertiary freshwater formation. In Nova Scotia one great deposit
of red marl, sandstone, and gypsum, precisely resembling in mineral
character the "New Red" of England, occurs as a member of the
Carboniferous group, and in the United States near the Falls of Niagara,
a similar formation constitutes a subdivision of the Silurian
series.<a name="FNanchor_238" id="FNanchor_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p>Nor was the nomenclature commonly adopted in geology without its
influence in perpetuating the erroneous doctrine of universal formations.
Such names, for example, as Chalk, Green Sand, Oolite, Red Marl, Coal,
and others, were given to some of the principal fossiliferous groups in
consequence of mineral peculiarities which happened to characterize
them in the countries where they were first studied. When geologists
had at length shown, by means of fossils and the order of superposition,
that other strata, entirely dissimilar in color, texture, and composition,
were of contemporaneous date, it was thought convenient still to retain
the old names. That these were often inappropriate was admitted;
but the student was taught to understand them in no other than a
chronological sense; so that the Chalk might not be a white cretaceous
rock, but a hard dolomitic limestone, as in the Alps, or a brown sandstone
or green marl, as in New Jersey, U. S. In like manner, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
Green Sand, it was said, might in some places be represented by red
sandstone, red marl, salt, and gypsum, as in the north of Spain. So
the oolitic texture was declared to be rather an exception than otherwise
to the general rule in rocks of the Oolitic period; and it often
became necessary to affirm that no particle of carbonaceous matter
could be detected in districts where the true Coal series abounded. In
spite of every precaution the habitual use of this language could scarcely
fail to instil into the mind of the pupil an idea that chalk, coal, salt, red
marl, or the Oolitic structure were far more widely characteristic of
the rocks of a given age than was really the case.</p>

<p>There is still another cause of deception, disposing us to ascribe a
more limited range to the newer sedimentary formations as compared
to the older, namely, the very general concealment of the newer strata
beneath the waters of lakes and seas, and the wide exposure above
waters of the more ancient. The Chalk, for example, now seen stretching
for thousands of miles over different parts of Europe, has become
visible to us by the effect, not of one, but of many distinct series of subterranean
movements. Time has been required, and a succession of
geological periods, to raise it above the waves in so many regions; and
if calcareous rocks of the middle and upper tertiary periods have been
formed, as homogeneous in mineral composition throughout equally extensive
regions, it may require convulsions as numerous as all those
which have occurred since the origin of the Chalk to bring them up
within the sphere of human observation. Hence the rocks of more
modern periods may appear partial, as compared to those of remoter
eras, not because of any original inferiority in their extent, but because
there has not been sufficient time since their origin for the development
of a great series of elevatory movements.</p>

<p>In regard, however, to one of the most important characteristics of
sedimentary rocks, their organic remains, many naturalists of high authority
have maintained that the same species of fossils are more uniformly
distributed through formations of high antiquity than in those of
more modern date, and that distinct zoological and botanical provinces,
as they are called, which form so striking a feature in the living creation,
were not established at remote eras. Thus the plants of the Coal,
the shells, the trilobites of the Silurian rocks, and the ammonites of the
Oolite, have been supposed to have a wider geographical range than
any living species of plants, crustaceans, or mollusks. This opinion
seems in certain cases to be well founded, especially in relation to the
plants of the Carboniferous epoch, owing probably to the more uniform
temperature of the globe, at a time when the position of sea and land
was less favorable to variations in climate, according to principles
already explained in the seventh and eighth chapters. But a recent
comparison of the fossils of North American rocks with those of corresponding
ages in the European series, has proved that the terrestrial
vegetation of the Carboniferous epoch is an exception to the general
rule, and that the fauna and flora of the earth at successive periods,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
from the oldest Silurian to the newest Tertiary was as diversified as
now. The shells, corals, and other classes of organic remains demonstrate
the fact that the earth might then have been divided into separate
zoological provinces, in a manner analogous to that observed in the geographical
distribution of species now living.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XI.</h4>

<h6>ON THE SUPPOSED FORMER INTENSITY OF THE IGNEOUS FORCES.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Volcanic action at successive geological periods&mdash;Plutonic rocks of different ages&mdash;Gradual

sudden upheaval of parallel mountain-chains&mdash;Objections to the proof of the

sinking slowly, so narrow zones of land may be pushed up gradually to great
heights&mdash;Bending of strata by lateral pressure&mdash;Adequacy of the volcanic
power to effect this without paroxysmal convulsions.</p></div>

<p>When reasoning on the intensity of volcanic action at former periods,
as well as on the power of moving water, already treated of, geologists
have been ever prone to represent Nature as having been prodigal of
violence and parsimonious of time. Now, although it is less easy to
determine the relative ages of the volcanic than of the fossiliferous formations,
it is undeniable that igneous rocks have been produced at all
geological periods, or as often as we find distinct deposits marked by
peculiar animal and vegetable remains. It can be shown that rocks
commonly called trappean have been injected into fissures, and ejected
at the surface, both before and during the deposition of the Carboniferous
series, and at the time when the Magnesian Limestone, and
when the Upper New Red Sandstone were formed, or when the Lias,
Oolite, Green Sand, Chalk, and the several tertiary groups newer than
the chalk, originated in succession. Nor is this all: distinct volcanic
products may be referred to the subordinate divisions of each period,
such as the Carboniferous, as in the county of Fife, in Scotland, where
certain masses of contemporaneous trap are associated with the Lower,
others with the Upper Coal measures. And if one of these masses is
more minutely examined, we find it to consist of the products of a great
many successive outbursts, by which scori&aelig; and lava were again and
again emitted, and afterwards consolidated, then fissured, and finally
traversed by melted matter, constituting what are called dikes.<a name="FNanchor_239" id="FNanchor_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> As
we enlarge, therefore, our knowledge of the ancient rocks formed by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
subterranean heat, we find ourselves compelled to regard them as the
aggregate effects of innumerable eruptions, each of which may have
been comparable in violence to those now experienced in volcanic
regions.</p>

<p>It may indeed be said that we have as yet no data for estimating the
relative volume of matter simultaneously in a state of fusion at two
given periods, as if we were to compare the columnar basalt of Staffa
and its environs with the lava poured out in Iceland in 1783; but for
this very reason it would be rash and unphilosophical to assume an excess
of ancient as contrasted with modern outpourings of melted matter
at particular periods of time.<a name="FNanchor_240" id="FNanchor_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> It would be still more presumptuous to
take for granted that the more deep-seated effects of subterranean heat
surpassed at remote eras the corresponding effects of internal heat in
our own times. Certain porphyries and granites, and all the rocks commonly
called plutonic, are now generally supposed to have resulted from
the slow cooling of materials fused and solidified under great pressure;
and we cannot doubt that beneath existing volcanoes there are large
spaces filled with melted stone, which must for centuries remain in an
incandescent state, and then cool and become hard and crystalline when
the subterranean heat shall be exhausted. That lakes of lava are continuous
for hundreds of miles beneath the Chilian Andes, seems established
by observations made in the year 1835.<a name="FNanchor_241" id="FNanchor_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>Now, wherever the fluid contents of such reservoirs are poured out
successively from craters in the open air, or at the bottom of the sea,
the matter so ejected may afford evidence by its arrangement of having
originated at different periods; but if the subterranean residue after the
withdrawal of the heat be converted into crystalline or plutonic rock,
the entire mass may seem to have been formed at once, however countless
the ages required for its fusion and subsequent refrigeration. As
the idea that all the granite in the earth's crust was produced simultaneously,
and in a primitive state of the planet, has now been universally
abandoned; so the suggestion above adverted to, may put us on our
guard against too readily adopting another opinion, namely, that each
large mass of granite was generated in a brief period of time.</p>

<p>Modern writers indeed, of authority, seem more and more agreed that
in the case of granitic rocks, the passage from a liquid or pasty to a
solid and crystalline state must have been an extremely gradual process.</p>

<p>The doctrine so much insisted upon formerly, that crystalline rocks,
such as granite, gneiss, mica-schist, quartzite, and others were produced
in the greatest abundance in the earlier ages of the planet, and that
their formation has ceased altogether in our own times, will be controverted
in the next chapter.</p>

<p><i>Gradual development of subterranean movements.</i>&mdash;The extreme violence
of the subterranean forces in remote ages has been often inferred
from the facts that the older rocks are more fractured and dislocated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
than the newer. But what other result could we have anticipated if the
quantity of movement had been always equal in equal periods of time?
Time must, in that case, multiply the derangement of strata in the ratio
of their antiquity. Indeed the numerous exceptions to the above rule
which we find in nature, present at first sight the only objection to the
hypothesis of uniformity. For the more ancient formations remain in
many places horizontal, while in others much newer strata are curved
and vertical. This apparent anomaly, however, will be seen in the next
chapter to depend on the irregular manner in which the volcanic and
subterranean agency affect different parts of the earth in succession, being
often renewed again and again in certain areas, while others remain
during the whole time at rest.</p>

<p>That the more impressive effects of subterranean power, such as the
upheaval of mountain-chains, may have been due to multiplied convulsions
of moderate intensity rather than to a few paroxysmal explosions,
will appear the less improbable when the gradual and intermittent development
of volcanic eruptions in times past is once established. It is
now very generally conceded that these eruptions have their source in
the same causes as those which give rise to the permanent elevation and
sinking of land; the admission, therefore, that one of the two volcanic
or subterranean processes has gone on gradually, draws with it the conclusion
that the effects of the other have been elaborated by successive
and gradual efforts.</p>

<p><i>Faults.</i>&mdash;The same reasoning is applicable to great <i>faults</i>, or those
striking instances of the upthrow or downthrow of large masses of rock,
which have been thought by some to imply tremendous catastrophes
wholly foreign to the ordinary course of nature. Thus we have in
England faults, in which the vertical displacement is between 600 and
3000 feet, and the horizontal extent thirty miles or more, the width of
the fissures since filled up with rubbish varying from ten to fifty feet.
But when we inquire into the proofs of the mass having risen or fallen
suddenly on the one side of these great rents, several hundreds or thousands
of feet above or below the rock with which it was once continuous
on the other side, we find the evidence defective. There are grooves, it
is said, and scratches on the rubbed and polished walls, which have
often one common direction, favoring the theory that the movement was
accomplished by a single stroke, and not by a series of interrupted movements.
But, in fact, the stri&aelig; are not always parallel in such cases, but
often irregular, and sometimes the stones and earth which are in the middle
of the fault, or fissure, have been polished and striated by friction in
different directions, showing that there have been slidings subsequent to
the first introduction of the fragmentary matter. Nor should we forget
that the last movement must always tend to obliterate the signs of previous
trituration, so that neither its instantaneousness nor the uniformity
of its direction can be inferred from the parallelism of the stri&aelig; that
have been last produced.</p>

<p>When rocks have been once fractured, and freedom of motion communicated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
to detached portions of them, these will naturally continue
to yield in the same direction, if the process of upheaval or of undermining
be repeated again and again. The incumbent mass will always
give way along the lines of least resistance, or where it was formerly
rent asunder. Probably, the effects of reiterated movement, whether
upward or downward, in a fault, may be undistinguishable from those
of a single and instantaneous rise or subsidence; and the same may be
said of the rising or falling of continental masses, such as Sweden or
Greenland, which we know to take place slowly and insensibly.</p>

<p><i>Doctrine of the sudden upheaval of parallel mountain-chains.</i>&mdash;The
doctrine of the suddenness of many former revolutions in the physical
geography of the globe has been thought by some to derive additional
confirmation from a theory respecting the origin of mountain-chains, advanced
in 1833 by a distinguished geologist, M. Elie de Beaumont. In
several essays on this subject, the last published in 1852, he has attempted
to establish two points; first, that a variety of independent
chains of mountains have been thrown up suddenly at particular periods;
and, secondly, that the contemporaneous chains thus thrown up, preserve
a parallelism the one to the other.</p>

<p>These opinions, and others by which they are accompanied, are so
adverse to the method of interpreting the history of geological changes
which I have recommended in this work, that I am desirous of explaining
the grounds of my dissent, a course which I feel myself the more
called upon to adopt, as the generalizations alluded to are those of a
skilful writer, and an original observer of great talent and experience.
I shall begin, therefore, by giving a brief summary of the principal propositions
laid down in the works above referred to.<a name="FNanchor_242" id="FNanchor_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<p>1st. M. de Beaumont supposes "that in the history of the earth
there have been long periods of comparative repose, during which the
deposition of sedimentary matter has gone on in regular continuity; and
there have also been short periods of paroxysmal violence, during which
that continuity was broken.</p>

<p>"2dly. At each of these periods of violence or 'revolution,' in the
state of the earth's surface, a great number of mountain-chains have
been formed suddenly.</p>

<p>"3dly. The chains thrown up by a particular revolution have one
uniform direction, being parallel to each other within a few degrees of
the compass, even when situated in remote regions; whilst the chains
thrown up at different periods have, for the most part, different directions.</p>

<p>"4thly. Each 'revolution,' or 'great convulsion,' has fallen in with
the date of another geological phenomenon; namely, 'the passage from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
one independent sedimentary formation to another,' characterized by a
considerable difference in 'organic types.'</p>

<p>"5thly. There has been a recurrence of these paroxysmal movements
from the remotest geological periods; and they may still be reproduced,
and the repose in which we live may hereafter be broken by the sudden
upthrow of another system of parallel chains of mountains.</p>

<p>"6thly. The origin of these chains depends not on partial volcanic
action, or a reiteration of ordinary earthquakes, but on the secular refrigeration
of the entire planet. For the whole globe, with the exception
of a thin envelope, much thinner in proportion than the shell to an
egg, is a fused mass, kept fluid by heat, but constantly cooling and
contracting its dimensions. The external crust does not gradually collapse
and accommodate itself century after century to the shrunken
nucleus, subsiding as often as there is a slight failure of support, but it
is sustained throughout whole geological periods, so as to become partially
separated from the nucleus, until at last it gives way suddenly,
cracking and falling in along determinate lines of fracture. During such
a crisis the rocks are subjected to great lateral pressure, the unyielding
ones are crushed, and the pliant strata bent, and are forced to pack
themselves more closely into a smaller space, having no longer the
same room to spread themselves out horizontally. At the same time,
a large portion of the mass is squeezed upwards, because it is in the
upward direction only that the excess in size of the envelope, as compared
to the contracted nucleus, can find relief. This excess produces
one or more of those folds or wrinkles in the earth's crust which we call
mountain-chains.</p>

<p>"Lastly, some chains are comparatively modern; such as the Alps,
which were partly upheaved after the middle tertiary period. The
elevation of the Andes was much more recent, and was accompanied by
the simultaneous outburst for the first time of 270 of the principal volcanoes
now active.<a name="FNanchor_243" id="FNanchor_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<p>"The agitation of the waters of the ocean caused by this convulsion
probably occasioned that transient and general deluge which is noticed
in the traditions of so many nations."<a name="FNanchor_244" id="FNanchor_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>Several of the topics enumerated in the above summary, such as the
cause of interruptions in the sedimentary series, will be discussed in the
thirteenth chapter, and I shall now confine myself to what I conceive
to be the insufficiency of the proofs adduced in favor of the suddenness
of the upthrow, and the contemporaneousness of the origin of the parallel
chains referred to. At the same time I may remark, that the great
body of facts collected together by M. de Beaumont will always form
a most valuable addition to our knowledge, tending as they do to confirm
the doctrine that different mountain-chains have been formed in
succession, and, as Werner first pointed out, that there are certain determinate
lines of direction or strike in the strata of various countries.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>The following may serve as an analysis of the evidence on which
the theory above stated depends. "We observe," says M. de Beaumont,
"when we attentively examine nearly all mountain-chains, that
the most recent rocks extend horizontally up to the foot of such chains,
as we should expect would be the case if they were deposited in seas
or lakes, of which these mountains have partly formed the shores;
whilst the other sedimentary beds, tilted up, and more or less contorted,
on the flanks of the mountains, rise in certain points even to their highest
crests."<a name="FNanchor_245" id="FNanchor_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> There are, therefore, in and adjacent to each chain, two
classes of sedimentary rocks, the ancient and inclined beds, and the
newer or horizontal. It is evident that the first appearance of the chain
itself was an event "intermediate between the period when the beds
now upraised were deposited, and the period when the strata were produced
horizontally at its feet."</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 11.</span><a name="f11" id="f11"></a><img src="images/f11.png" width="550" height="152"
alt="Chain A." title="" /></div>

<p>Thus the chain A assumed its present position after the deposition
of the strata <i>b</i>, which have undergone great movements, and before
the deposition of the group <i>c</i>, in which the strata have not suffered
derangement.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 12.</span><a name="f12" id="f12"></a><img src="images/f12.png" width="550" height="163"
alt="Chain B." title="" /></div>

<p>If we then discover another chain B, in which we find not only the
formation <i>b</i>, but the group <i>c</i> also, disturbed and thrown on its edges,
we may infer that the latter chain is of subsequent date to A; for B
must have been elevated <i>after</i> the deposition of <i>c</i>, and before that of
the group <i>d</i>; whereas A had originated <i>before</i> the strata <i>c</i> were formed.</p>

<p>It is then argued, that in order to ascertain whether other mountain
ranges are of contemporaneous date with A and B, or are referable to
<i>distinct</i> periods, we have only to inquire whether the inclined and undisturbed
sets of strata in each range correspond with or differ from
those in the typical chain A and B.</p>

<p>Now all this reasoning is perfectly correct, so long as the period of
time required for the deposition of the strata <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> is not made identical
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
in duration with the period of time during which the animals and
plants found fossil in <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> may have flourished; for the latter, that
is to say, the duration of certain groups of species, may have greatly
exceeded, and probably did greatly exceed, the former, or the time
required for the accumulation of certain local deposits, such as <i>b</i> and <i>c</i>
(figs. <a href="#f11">11</a> and <a href="#f12">12</a>). In order, moreover, to render the reasoning correct,
due latitude must be given to the term contemporaneous; for
this term must be understood to allude, not to a moment of time, but
to the interval, whether brief or protracted, which elapsed between
two events, namely, between the accumulation of the inclined and that
of the horizontal strata.</p>

<p>But, unfortunately, no attempt has been made in the treatises under
review to avoid this manifest source of confusion, and hence the very
terms of each proposition are equivocal; and the possible length of
some of the intervals is so vast, that to affirm that all the chains raised
in such intervals were <i>contemporaneous</i> is an abuse of language.</p>

<p>In order to illustrate this argument, I shall select the Pyrenees as an
example. Originally M. E. de Beaumont spoke of this range of mountains
as having been uplifted suddenly (<i>&agrave; un seul jet</i>), but he has since
conceded that in this chain, in spite of the general unity and simplicity
of its structure, six, if not seven, systems of dislocation of different dates
can be recognized.<a name="FNanchor_246" id="FNanchor_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> In reference, however, to the latest, and by far
the most important of these convulsions, the chain is said to have attained
its present elevation at a certain epoch in the earth's history,
namely, between the deposition of the chalk, or rocks of about that
age, and that of certain tertiary formations "as old as the plastic clay;"
for the chalk is seen in vertical, curved, and distorted beds on the flanks
of the chain, as the beds <i>b</i>, <a href="#f11">fig. 11</a>, while the tertiary formations rest
upon them in horizontal strata at its base, as <i>c</i>, ibid.</p>

<p>The proof, then, of the extreme suddenness of the convulsion is supposed
to be the shortness of the time which intervened between the
formation of the chalk and the origin of certain tertiary strata.<a name="FNanchor_247" id="FNanchor_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> Even
if the interval were deducible within these limits, it might comprise an
indefinite lapse of time. In strictness of reasoning, however, the author
cannot exclude the Cretaceous or Tertiary periods from the possible
duration of the interval during which the elevation may have taken
place. For, in the first place, it cannot be assumed that the movement
of upheaval took place after the close of the Cretaceous period;
we can merely say, that it occurred after the deposition of certain
strata of that period; secondly, although it were true that the event
happened before the formation of all the tertiary strata now at the base
of the Pyrenees, it would by no means follow that it preceded the
whole Tertiary epoch.</p>

<p>The age of the strata, both of the inclined and horizontal series, may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
have been accurately determined by M. De Beaumont, and still the upheaving
of the Pyrenees may have been going on before the animals of
the Chalk period, such as are found fossil in England, had ceased to exist,
or when the Maestricht beds were in progress, or during the indefinite
ages which may have elapsed between the extinction of the Maestricht
animals and the introduction of the Eocene tribes, or during the
Eocene epoch, or the rise may have been going on throughout one, or
several, or all of these periods.</p>

<p>It would be a purely gratuitous assumption to say that the inclined
cretaceous strata (<i>b</i>, <a href="#f11">fig. 11</a>.) on the flanks of the Pyrenees, were the
very last which were deposited during the Cretaceous period, or that,
as soon as they were upheaved, all or nearly all the species of animals
and plants now found fossil in them were suddenly exterminated; yet,
unless this can be affirmed, we cannot say that the Pyrenees were not
upheaved during the Cretaceous period. Consequently, another range
of mountains, at the base of which cretaceous rocks may lie in horizontal
stratification, may have been elevated, like the chain A, <a href="#f12">fig. 12</a>, during
some part of the same great period.</p>

<p>There are mountains in Sicily two or three thousand feet high, the
tops of which are composed of limestone, in which a large proportion of
the fossil shells agree specifically with those now inhabiting the Mediterranean.
Here, as in many other countries, the deposits now in progress
in the sea must inclose shells and other fossils specifically identical
with those of the rocks constituting the contiguous land. So there are
islands in the Pacific where a mass of dead coral has emerged to a considerable
altitude, while other portions of the mass remain beneath the
sea, still increasing by the growth of living zoophytes and shells. The
chalk of the Pyrenees, therefore, may at a remote period have been
raised to an elevation of several thousand feet, while the species found
fossil in the same chalk still continued to be represented in the fauna of
the neighboring ocean. In a word, we cannot assume that the origin of
a new range of mountains caused the Cretaceous period to cease, and
served as the prelude to a new order of things in the animate creation.</p>

<p>To illustrate the grave objections above advanced, against the theory
considered in the present chapter, let us suppose, that in some country
three styles of architecture had prevailed in succession, each for a period
of one thousand years; first the Greek, then the Roman, and then the
Gothic; and that a tremendous earthquake was known to have occurred
in the same district during one of the three periods&mdash;a convulsion of
such violence as to have levelled to the ground all the buildings then
standing. If an antiquary, desirous of discovering the date of the catastrophe,
should first arrive at a city where several Greek temples were
lying in ruins and half engulphed in the earth, while many Gothic edifices
were standing uninjured, could he determine on these data the era
of the shock? Could he even exclude any one of the three periods,
and decide that it must have happened during one of the other two?
Certainly not. He could merely affirm that it happened at some period
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
after the introduction of the Greek style, and before the Gothic had
fallen into disuse. Should he pretend to define the date of the convulsion
with greater precision, and decide that the earthquake must have
occurred after the Greek and before the Gothic period, that is to say,
when the Roman style was in use, the fallacy in his reasoning would be
too palpable to escape detection for a moment.</p>

<p>Yet such is the nature of the erroneous induction which I am now
exposing. For as, in the example above proposed, the erection of a
particular edifice is perfectly distinct from the period of architecture in
which it may have been raised, so is the deposition of chalk, or any
other set of strata, from the geological epochs characterized by certain
fossils to which they may belong.</p>

<p>It is almost superfluous to enter into any farther analysis of the theory
of parallelism, because the whole force of the argument depends on the
accuracy of the data by which the contemporaneous or
non-contemporaneous
date of the elevation of two independent chains can be demonstrated.
In every case, this evidence, as stated by M. de Beaumont, is
equivocal, because he has not included in the possible interval of time
between the depositions of the deranged and the horizontal formations,
part of the periods to which each of those classes of formations are referable.
Even if all the geological facts, therefore, adduced by the author
were true and unquestionable, yet the conclusion that certain chains
were or were not simultaneously upraised is by no means a legitimate
consequence.</p>

<p>In the third volume of my first edition of the Principles, which appeared
in April, 1833, I controverted the views of M. de Beaumont,
then just published, in the same terms as I have now restated them.
At that time I took for granted that the chronological date of the newest
rocks entering into the disturbed series of the Pyrenees had been
correctly ascertained. It now appears, however, that some of the most
modern of those disturbed strata belong to the nummulitic formation,
which are regarded by the majority of geologists as Eocene or older
tertiary, an opinion not assented to by M. E. de Beaumont, and which
I cannot discuss here without being led into too long a digression.<a name="FNanchor_248" id="FNanchor_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<p>Perhaps a more striking illustration of the difficulties we encounter,
when we attempt to apply the theory under consideration even to the
best known European countries, is afforded by what is called "The System
of the Longmynds." This small chain, situated in Shropshire, is
the third of the typical systems to which M. E. de Beaumont compares
other mountain ranges corresponding in <i>strike</i> and structure. The date
assigned to its upheaval is "after the unfossiliferous greywacke, or Cambrian
strata, and before the Silurian." But Sir R. I. Murchison had
shown in 1838, in his "Silurian System," and the British government
surveyors, since that time, in their sections (about 1845), that the Longmynds
and other chains of similar composition in North Wales are <i>post-Silurian</i>.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
In all of them fossiliferous beds of the lower Silurian formation,
or Llandeilo flags are highly inclined, and often vertical. In one
limited region the Caradoc sandstone, a member of the lower Silurian,
rests unconformably on the denuded edges of the inferior (or Llandeilo)
member of the same group; whilst in some cases both of these sets of
strata are upturned. When, therefore, so grave an error is detected in
regard to the age of a typical chain, we are entitled to inquire with surprise,
by what means nine other <i>parallel</i> chains in France, Germany,
and Sweden, assumed to be "ante-Silurian," have been made to agree
precisely in date with the Longmynds? If they are correctly represented
as having been all deposited before the deposition of the Silurian
strata, they cannot be contemporaneous with the Longmynds, and they
only prove how little reliance can be placed on parallelism as a test of
simultaneousness of upheaval. But in truth it is impossible, for reasons
already given, to demonstrate that each of those nine chains coincide in
date with one another, any more than with the Longmynds.</p>

<p>The reader will see in the sequel (chap. <a href="#Page_533">31</a><a name="FNanchor_249" id="FNanchor_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>) that Mr. Hopkins has
inferred from astronomical calculations, that the solid crust of the earth
cannot be less than 800 or 1000 miles thick, and may be more. Even
if it be solid to the depth of 100 miles, such a thickness would be inconsistent
with M. E. de Beaumont's hypothesis, which requires a shell
not more than thirty miles thick, or even less. Mr. Hopkins admits
that the exterior of the planet, though solid as a whole, may contain
within it vast lakes or seas of lava. If so, the gradual fusion of rocks,
and the expansive power of heat exerted for ages, as well as the subsequent
contraction of the same during slow refrigeration, may perhaps
account for the origin of mountain-chains, for these, as Dolomieu has
remarked, are "far less important, proportionally speaking, than the inequalities
on the surface of an egg-shell, which to the eye appears
smooth." A "centripetal force" affecting the whole planet as it cools,
seems a mightier cause than is required to produce wrinkles of such
insignificant size.</p>

<p>In pursuing his investigations, M. E. de Beaumont has of late greatly
multiplied the number of successive periods of instantaneous upheaval,
admitting at the same time that occasionally new lines of upthrow have
taken the direction of older ones.<a name="FNanchor_250" id="FNanchor_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> These admissions render his views
much more in harmony with the principles advocated in this work, but
they impair the practical utility of parallelism considered as a chronological
test; for no rule is laid down for limiting the interval, whether in
time or space, which may separate two parallel lines of upheaval of
different dates.<a name="FNanchor_251" id="FNanchor_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
Among the various propositions above laid down (p. 164), it will be
seen that the sudden rise of the Andes is spoken of as a modern event,
but Mr. Darwin has brought together ample data in proof of the local
persistency of volcanic action throughout a long succession of geological
periods, beginning with times antecedent to the deposition of the oolitic
and cretaceous formations of Chili, and continuing to the historical
epoch. It appears that some of the parallel ridges which compose the
Cordilleras, instead of being contemporaneous, were successively and
slowly upheaved at widely different epochs. The whole range, after
twice subsiding some thousands of feet, was brought up again by a slow
movement in mass, during the era of the Eocene tertiary formations,
after which the whole sank down once more several hundred feet, to be
again uplifted to its present level by a slow and often interrupted movement.<a name="FNanchor_252" id="FNanchor_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>
In a portion of this latter period the "Pampean mud" was
formed, in which the Megatherium mylodon and other extinct quadrupeds
are buried. This mud contains in it recent species of shells, some
of them proper to brackish water, and is believed by Mr. Darwin to be
an estuary or delta deposit. M. A. d'Orbigny, however, has advanced
an hypothesis referred to by M. E. de Beaumont, that the agitation and
displacement of the waters of the ocean, caused by the elevation of the
Andes, gave rise to a deluge, of which this Pampean mud, which rises
sometimes to the height of 12,000 feet, is the result and monument.<a name="FNanchor_253" id="FNanchor_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<p>In studying many chains of mountains, we find that the strike or line
of outcrop of continuous sets of strata, and the general direction of the
chain, may be far from rectilinear. Curves forming angles of 20&deg; or 30&deg;
may be found in the same range as in the Alleghanies; just as trains
of active volcanoes and the zones throughout which modern earthquakes
occur are often linear, without running in straight lines. Nor are all of
these, though contemporaneous or belonging to our own epoch, by any
means parallel, but some at right angles, the one to the other.</p>

<p><i>Slow upheaval and subsidence.</i>&mdash;Recent observations have disclosed
to us the wonderful fact, that not only the west coast of South
America, but also other large areas, some of them several thousand
miles in circumference, such as Scandinavia, and certain archipelagoes in
the Pacific, are slowly and insensibly rising; while other regions, such
as Greenland, and parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans, in which
atolls or circular coral islands abound, are as gradually sinking. That
all the existing continents and submarine abysses may have originated
in movements of this kind, continued throughout incalculable periods of
time, is undeniable, and the denudation which the dry land appears
everywhere to have suffered, favors the idea that it was raised from
the deep by a succession of upward movements, prolonged throughout
indefinite periods. For the action of waves and currents on land slowly
emerging from the deep, affords the only power by which we can conceive
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
so many deep valleys and wide spaces to have been denuded as
those which are unquestionably the effects of running water.</p>

<p>But perhaps it may be said that there is no analogy between the slow
upheaval of broad plains or table-lands, and the manner in which we
must presume all mountain-chains, with their inclined strata, to have
originated. It seems, however, that the Andes have been rising century
after century, at the rate of several feet, while the Pampas on the
east have been raised only a few inches in the same time. Crossing
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, in a line passing through Mendoza,
Mr. Darwin traversed a plain 800 miles broad, the eastern part of
which has emerged from beneath the sea at a very modern period.
The slope from the Atlantic is at first very gentle, then greater, until
the traveller finds, on reaching Mendoza, that he has gained, almost insensibly,
a height of 4000 feet. The mountainous district then begins
suddenly, and its breadth from Mendoza to the shores of the Pacific is
120 miles, the average height of the principal chain being from 15,000
to 16,000 feet, without including some prominent peaks, which ascend
much higher. Now all we require, to explain the origin of the principal
inequalities of level here described, is to imagine, first, a zone of more
violent movement to the west of Mendoza, and, secondly, to the east of
that place, an upheaving force, which died away gradually as it approached
the Atlantic. In short, we are only called upon to conceive,
that the region of the Andes was pushed up four feet in the same period
in which the Pampas near Mendoza rose one foot, and the plains
near the shores of the Atlantic one inch. In Europe we have learnt
that the land at the North Cape ascends about five feet in a century,
while farther to the south the movements diminish in quantity first to a
foot, and then, at Stockholm, to three inches in a century, while at certain
points still farther south there is no movement.</p>

<p>But in what manner, it is asked, can we account for the great lateral
pressure which has been exerted not only in the Andes, Alps, and other
chains, but also on the strata of many low and nearly level countries?
Do not the folding and fracture of the beds, the anticlinal and synclinal
ridges and troughs, as they are called, and the vertical, and even sometimes
the inverted position of the beds, imply an abruptness and intensity
in the disturbing force wholly different in kind and energy to that
which now rends the rocks during ordinary earthquakes? I shall treat
more fully in the sequel (end of chap. 32) of the probable subterranean
sources, whether of upward or downward movement, and of great lateral
pressure; but it may be well briefly to state in this place that in our
own times, as, for example, in Chili, in 1822, the volcanic force has
overcome the resistance, and permanently uplifted a country of such
vast extent that the weight and volume of the Andes must be insignificant
in comparison, even if we indulge the most moderate conjectures as
to the thickness of the earth's crust above the volcanic foci.</p>

<p>To assume that any set of strata with which we are acquainted are
made up of such cohesive and unyielding materials, as to be able to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
resist a power of such stupendous energy, if its direction, instead of
being vertical, happened to be oblique or horizontal, would be extremely
rash. But if they could yield to a sideway thrust, even in a slight degree,
they would become squeezed and folded to any amount if subjected
for a sufficient number of times to the repeated action of the
same force. We can scarcely doubt that a mass of rock several miles
thick was uplifted in Chili in 1822 and 1835, and that a much greater
volume of solid matter is upheaved wherever the rise of the land is very
gradual, as in Scandinavia, the development of heat being probably, in
that region, at a greater distance from the surface. If continents,
rocked, shaken, and fissured, like the western region of South America,
or very gently elevated, like Norway and Sweden, do not acquire in a
few days or hours an additional height of several thousand feet, this
can arise from no lack of mechanical force in the subterranean moving
cause, but simply because the antagonist power, or the strength, toughness,
and density of the earth's crust is insufficient to resist, so long, as
to allow the volcanic energy an indefinite time to accumulate. Instead
of the explosive charge augmenting in quantity for countless ages, it
finds relief continuously, or by a succession of shocks of moderate violence,
so as never to burst or blow up the covering of incumbent rock
in one grand paroxysmal convulsion. Even in its most energetic efforts
it displays an intermittent and mitigated intensity, being never permitted
to lay a whole continent in ruins. Hence the numerous eruptions
of lava from the same vent, or chain of vents, and the recurrence of
similar earthquakes for thousands of years along certain areas or zones
of country. Hence the numerous monuments of the successive ejection
and injection of melted matter in ancient geological epochs, and the fissures
formed in distinct ages, and often widened and filled at different
eras.</p>

<p>Among the causes of lateral pressure, the expansion by heat of large
masses of solid stone intervening between others which have a different
degree of expansibility, or which happen not to have their temperature
raised at the same time, may play an important part. But as we know
that rocks have so often sunk down thousands of feet below their original
level, we can hardly doubt that much of the bending of pliant
strata, and the packing of the same into smaller spaces, has frequently
been occasioned by subsidence. Whether the failure of support be
produced by the melting of porous rocks, which, when fluid, and subjected
to great pressure, may occupy less room than before, or which,
by passing from a pasty to a crystalline condition, may, as in the case
of granite, according to the experiments of Deville, suffer a contraction
of 10 per cent., or whether the sinking be due to the subtraction of
lava driven elsewhere to some volcanic orifice, and there forced outwards,
or whether it be brought on by the shrinking of solid and stony
masses during refrigeration, or by the condensation of gases, or any
other imaginable cause, we have no reason to incline to the idea that
the consequent geological changes are brought about so suddenly, as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
that large parts of continents are swallowed up at once in unfathomable
subterranean abysses. If cavities be formed, they will be enlarged
gradually, and as gradually filled. We read, indeed, accounts of engulphed
cities and areas of limited extent which have sunk down many
yards at once; but we have as yet no authentic records of the sudden
disappearance of mountains, or the submergence or emergence of great
islands. On the other hand, the creeps in coal mines<a name="FNanchor_254" id="FNanchor_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> demonstrate
that gravitation begins to act as soon as a moderate quantity of matter
is removed even at a great depth. The roof sinks in, or the floor of the
mine rises, and the bent strata often assume as regularly a curved and
crumpled arrangement as that observed on a grander scale in mountain-chains.
The absence, indeed, of chaotic disorder, and the regularity
of the plications in geological formations of high antiquity, although
not unfrequently adduced to prove the unity and instantaneousness
of the disturbing force, might with far greater propriety be brought
forward as an argument in favor of the successive application of some
irresistible but moderated force, such as that which can elevate or depress
a continent.</p>

<p>In conclusion, I may observe that one of the soundest objections to
the theory of the sudden upthrow or downthrow of mountain-chains is
this, that it provides us with too much force of one kind, namely, that
of subterranean movement, while it deprives us of another kind of mechanical
force, namely, that exerted by the waves and currents of the
ocean, which the geologist requires for the denudation of land during its
slow upheaval or depression. It may be safely affirmed that the quantity
of igneous and aqueous action,&mdash;of volcanic eruption and denudation,&mdash;of
subterranean movement and sedimentary deposition,&mdash;not
only of past ages, but of one geological epoch, or even the fraction of
an epoch, has exceeded immeasurably all the fluctuations of the inorganic
world which have been witnessed by man. But we have still to
inquire whether the time to which each chapter or page or paragraph
of the earth's autobiography relates, was not equally immense when
contrasted with a brief era of 3000 or 5000 years. The real point on
which the whole controversy turns, is the relative amount of work done
by mechanical force in given quantities of time, past and present. Before
we can determine the relative intensity of the force employed, we
must have some fixed standard by which to measure the time expended
in its development at two distinct periods. It is not the magnitude of
the effects, however gigantic their proportions, which can inform us in
the slightest degree whether the operation was sudden or gradual, insensible
or paroxysmal. It must be shown that a slow process could
never in any series of ages give rise to the same results.</p>

<p>The advocate of paroxysmal energy might assume a uniform and
fixed rate of variation in times past and present for the animate world,
that is to say, for the dying-out and coming-in of species, and then endeavor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
to prove that the changes of the inanimate world have not gone
on in a corresponding ratio. But the adoption of such a standard of
comparison would lead, I suspect, to a theory by no means favorable to
the pristine intensity of natural causes. That the present state of the
organic world is not stationary, can be fairly inferred from the fact, that
some species are known to have become extinct in the course even of
the last three centuries, and that the exterminating causes always in
activity, both on the land and in the waters, are very numerous; also,
because man himself is an extremely modern creation; and we may
therefore reasonably suppose that some of the mammalia now contemporary
with man, as well as a variety of species of inferior classes, may
have been recently introduced into the earth, to supply the places of
plants and animals which have from time to time disappeared. But
granting that some such secular variation in the zoological and botanical
worlds is going on, and is by no means wholly inappreciable to the
naturalist, still it is certainly far less manifest than the revolution always
in progress in the inorganic world. Every year some volcanic eruptions
take place, and a rude estimate might be made of the number of cubic
feet of lava and scori&aelig; poured or cast out of various craters. The
amount of mud and sand deposited in deltas, and the advance of new
land upon the sea, or the annual retreat of wasting sea-cliffs, are changes
the minimum amount of which might be roughly estimated. The quantity
of land raised above or depressed below the level of the sea might
also be computed, and the change arising from such movements in a
century might be conjectured. Suppose the average rise of the land in
some parts of Scandinavia to be as much as five feet in a hundred years,
the present sea-coast might be uplifted 700 feet in fourteen thousand
years; but we should have no reason to anticipate, from any zoological
data hitherto acquired, that the molluscous fauna of the northern seas
would in that lapse of years undergo any sensible amount of variation.
We discover sea-beaches in Norway 700 feet high, in which the shells
are identical with those now inhabiting the German Ocean; for the rise
of land in Scandinavia, however insensible to the inhabitants, has evidently
been rapid when compared to the rate of contemporaneous change
in the testaceous fauna of the German Ocean. Were we to wait therefore
until the mollusca shall have undergone as much fluctuation as
they underwent between the period of the Lias and the Upper Oolite
formations; or between the Oolite and Chalk, nay, even between any
two of eight subdivisions of the Eocene series, what stupendous revolutions
in physical geography ought we not to expect, and how many
mountain-chains might not be produced by the repetition of shocks of
moderate violence, or by movements not even perceptible by man!</p>

<p>Or, if we turn from the mollusca to the vegetable kingdom, and ask
the botanist how many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions might be
expected, and how much the relative level of land and sea might be
altered, or how far the principal deltas will encroach upon the ocean,
or the sea-cliffs recede from the present shores, before the species of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
European forest-trees will die out, he would reply that such alterations
in the inanimate world might be multiplied indefinitely before he should
have reason to anticipate, by reference to any known data, that the existing
species of trees in our forests would disappear and give place to
others. In a word, the movement of the inorganic world is obvious and
palpable, and might be likened to the minute-hand of a clock, the progress
of which can be seen and heard, whereas the fluctuations of the
living creation are nearly invisible, and resemble the motion of the hour-hand
of a timepiece. It is only by watching it attentively for some
time, and comparing its relative position after an interval, that we can
prove the reality of its motion.<a name="FNanchor_255" id="FNanchor_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

and slaty texture&mdash;Crystalline character of Plutonic and Metamorphic rocks&mdash;Theory
of their origin&mdash;Essentially subterranean&mdash;No proofs that they were
produced more abundantly at remote periods.</p></div>

<p>Another argument in favor of the dissimilarity of the causes operating
at remote and recent eras has been derived by many geologists from
the more compact, stony, and crystalline texture of the older as compared
with the newer rocks.</p>

<p><i>Consolidation of strata.</i>&mdash;This subject may be considered, first in
reference to the fossiliferous strata; and, secondly, in reference to
those crystalline and stratified rocks which contain no organic remains,
such as gneiss and mica-schist. There can be no doubt that the former
of these classes, or the fossiliferous, are generally more compact and
stony in proportion as they are more ancient. It is also certain that a
great part of them were originally in a soft and incoherent state, and
that they have been since consolidated. Thus we find occasionally
that shingle and sand have been agglutinated firmly together by a ferruginous
or siliceous cement, or that lime in solution has been introduced,
so as to bind together materials previously incoherent. Organic
remains have sometimes suffered a singular transformation, as for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
example, where shells, corals, and wood are silicified, their calcareous or
ligneous matter having been replaced by nearly pure silica. The constituents
of some beds have probably set and become hard for the first
time when they emerged from beneath the water.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, we observe in certain formations now in progress,
particularly in coral reefs, and in deposits from the waters of
mineral springs, both calcareous and siliceous, that the texture of rocks
may sometimes be stony from the first. This circumstance may account
for exceptions to the general rule, not unfrequently met with,
where solid strata are superimposed on others of a plastic and incoherent
nature, as in the neighborhood of Paris, where the tertiary formations,
consisting often of compact limestone and siliceous grit, are more
stony than the subjacent chalk.</p>

<p>It will readily be understood, that the various solidifying causes, including
those above enumerated, together with the pressure of incumbent
rocks and the influence of subterranean heat, must all of them
require time in order to exert their full power. If in the course of ages
they modify the aspect and internal structure of stratified deposits, they
will give rise to a general distinctness of character in the older as contrasted
with the newer formations. But this distinctness will not be
the consequence of any original diversity; they will be unlike, just as
the wood in the older trees of a forest usually differs in texture and
hardness from that of younger individuals of the same species.</p>

<p><i>Transition texture</i>.&mdash;In the original classification, of Werner, the
highly crystalline rocks, such as granite and gneiss, which contain no
organic remains, were called primary, and the fossiliferous strata secondary,
while to another class of an age intermediate between the
primary and secondary he gave the name of transition. They were
termed transition because they partook in some degree in their mineral
composition of the nature of the most crystalline rocks, such as gneiss
and mica-schist, while they resembled the fossiliferous series in containing
occasionally organic remains, and exhibiting evident signs of a mechanical
origin. It was at first imagined, that the rocks having this intermediate
texture had been all deposited subsequently to the series
called primary, and before all the more earthy and fossiliferous formations.
But when the relative position and organic remains of these
transition rocks were better understood, it was perceived that they did
not all belong to one period. On the contrary, the same mineral characters
were found in strata of very different ages, and some formations
occurring in the Alps, which several of the ablest scholars of Werner
had determined to be transition, were ultimately ascertained, by means
of their fossil contents and position, to be members of the Cretaceous,
and even of the nummulitic or Eocene period. These strata had, in
fact, acquired the <i>transition</i> texture from the influence of causes which,
since their deposition had modified their internal arrangement.</p>

<p><i>Texture and origin of Plutonic and metamorphic rocks</i>.&mdash;Among the
most singular of the changes superinduced on rocks, we have occasionally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
to include the slaty texture, the divisional planes of which sometimes
intersect the true planes of stratification, and even pass directly
through imbedded fossils. If, then, the crystalline, the slaty, and other
modes of arrangement, once deemed characteristic of certain periods in
the history of the earth, have in reality been assumed by fossiliferous
rocks of different ages and at different times, we are prepared to inquire
whether the same may not be true of the most highly crystalline state,
such as that of gneiss, mica-schist, and statuary marble. That the
peculiar characteristics of such rocks are really due to a variety of modifying
causes has long been suspected by many geologists, and the
doctrine has gained ground of late, although a considerable difference
of opinion still prevails. According to the original Neptunian theory,
all the crystalline formations were precipitated from a universal menstruum
or chaotic fluid antecedently to the creation of animals and
plants, the unstratified granite having been first thrown down so as to
serve as a floor or foundation on which gneiss and other stratified
rocks might repose. Afterwards, when the igneous origin of granite
was no longer disputed, many conceived that a thermal ocean enveloped
the globe, at a time when the first-formed crust of granite was
cooling, but when it still retained much of its heat. The hot waters
of this ocean held in solution the ingredients of gneiss, mica-schist,
hornblende-schist, clay-slate, and marble, rocks which were precipitated,
one after the other, in a crystalline form. No fossils could be
inclosed in them, the high temperature of the fluid and the quantity of
mineral matter which it held in solution, rendering it unfit for the support
of organic beings.</p>

<p>It would be inconsistent with the plan of this work to enter here into
a detailed account of what I have elsewhere termed the <i>metamorphic
theory</i>;<a name="FNanchor_256" id="FNanchor_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> but I may state that it is now demonstrable in some countries
that fossiliferous formations, some of them of the age of the Silurian
strata, as near Christiana in Norway, others belonging to the Oolitic
period, as around Carrara in Italy, have been converted partially into
gneiss, mica-schist, and statuary marble. The transmutation has been
effected apparently by the influence of subterranean heat, acting under
great pressure, or by chemical and electrical causes operating in a manner
not yet understood, and which have been termed <i>Plutonic</i> action,
as expressing, in one word, all the modifying causes which may be
brought into play at great depths, and under conditions never exemplified
at the surface. To this Plutonic action the fusion of granite itself
in the bowels of the earth, as well as the superinducement of the metamorphic
texture into sedimentary strata, must be attributed; and in
accordance with these views the age of each metamorphic formation
may be said to be twofold, for we have first to consider the period
when it originated, as an aqueous deposit, in the form of mud, sand,
marl, or limestone; secondly, the date at which it acquired a crystalline
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
texture. The same strata, therefore, may, according to this view,
be very ancient in reference to the time of their deposition, and very
modern in regard to the period of their assuming the metamorphic
character.</p>

<p><i>No proofs that these crystalline rocks were produced more abundantly
at remote periods</i>.&mdash;Several modern writers, without denying the truth
of the Plutonic or metamorphic theory, still contend that the crystalline
and non-fossiliferous formations, whether stratified or unstratified, such
as gneiss and granite, are essentially ancient as a class of rocks. They
were generated, say they, most abundantly in the primeval state of
the globe, since which time the quantity produced has been always on
the decrease, until it became very inconsiderable in the Oolitic and Cretaceous
periods, and quite evanescent before the commencement of the
tertiary epoch.</p>

<p>Now the justness of these views depends almost entirely on the question
whether granite, gneiss, and other rocks of the same order ever
originated at the surface, or whether, according to the opinions above
adopted, they are essentially subterranean in their origin, and therefore
entitled to the appellation of <i>hypogene</i>. If they were formed superficially
in their present state, and as copiously in the modern as in the
more ancient periods, we ought to see a greater abundance of tertiary
and secondary than of primary granite and gneiss; but if we adopt the
hypogene theory before explained, their rapid diminution in volume
among the visible rocks in the earth's crust in proportion as we investigate
the formations of newer date, is quite intelligible. If a melted
mass of matter be now cooling very slowly at the depth of several
miles beneath the crater of an active volcano, it must remain invisible
until great revolutions in the earth's crust have been brought about.
So also if stratified rocks have been subjected to Plutonic action, and
after having been baked or reduced to semi-fusion, are now cooling and
crystallizing far under ground, it will probably require the lapse of
many periods before they will be forced up to the surface and exposed
to view, even at a single point. To effect this purpose there may be
need of as great a development of subterranean movement as that which
in the Alps, Andes, and Himalaya has raised marine strata containing
ammonites to the height of 8000, 14,000, and 16,000 feet. By parity
of reasoning we can hardly expect that any hypogene rocks of the
tertiary periods will have been brought within the reach of human
observation, seeing that the emergence of such rocks must always be so
long posterior to the date of their origin, and still less can formations
of this class become generally visible until so much time has elapsed as
to confer on them a high relative antiquity. Extensive denudation must
also combine with upheaval before they can be displayed at the surface
throughout wide areas.</p>

<p>All geologists who reflect on subterranean movements now going on,
and the eruptions of active volcanoes, are convinced that great changes
are now continually in progress in the interior of the earth's crust far out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
of sight. They must be conscious, therefore, that the inaccessibility of
the regions in which these alterations are taking place, compels them to
remain in ignorance of a great part of the working of existing causes, so
that they can only form vague conjectures in regard to the nature of the
products which volcanic heat may elaborate under great pressure.</p>

<p>But when they find in mountain-chains of high antiquity, that what
was once the interior of the earth's crust has since been forced outwards
and exposed to view, they will naturally expect in the examination of
those mountainous regions, to have an opportunity of gratifying their
curiosity by obtaining a sight not only of the superficial strata of remote
eras, but also of the contemporaneous nether-formed rocks. Having
recognized, therefore, in such mountain-chains some ancient rocks of
aqueous and volcanic origin, corresponding in character to superficial
formations of modern date, they will regard any other class of ancient
rocks, such as granite and gneiss, as the <i>residual phenomena</i> of which
they are in search. These latter rocks will not answer the expectations
previously formed of their probable nature and texture, unless they wear
a foreign and mysterious aspect, and have in some places been fused or
altered by subterranean heat; in a word, unless they differ wholly from
the fossiliferous strata deposited at the surface, or from the lava and
scori&aelig; thrown out by volcanoes in the open air. It is the total distinctness,
therefore, of crystalline formations, such as granite, hornblende-schist,
and the rest, from every substance of which the origin is familiar
to us, that constitutes their claim to be regarded as the effects of causes
now in action in the subterranean regions. They belong not to an order
of things which has passed away; they are not the monuments of a
primeval period, bearing inscribed upon them in obsolete characters the
words and phrases of a dead language; but they teach us that part of
the living language of nature, which we cannot learn by our daily intercourse
with what passes on the habitable surface.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XIII</h4>

<h6>UNIFORMITY IN THE SERIES OF PAST CHANGES IN THE ANIMATE AND
INANIMATE WORLD.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Supposed alternate periods of repose and disorder&mdash;Observed facts in which this
doctrine has originated&mdash;These may be explained by supposing a uniform and
uninterrupted series of changes&mdash;Threefold consideration of this subject; first, in
reference to the living creation, extinction of species, and origin of new animals
and plants; secondly, in reference to the changes produced in the earth's crust by
the continuance of subterranean movements in certain areas, and their transference
after long periods to new areas; thirdly, in reference to the laws which govern
the formation of fossiliferous strata, and the shifting of the areas of sedimentary
deposition&mdash;On the combined influence of all these modes and causes of change
in producing breaks and chasms in the chain of records&mdash;Concluding remarks
on the identity of the ancient and present system of terrestrial changes.</p></div>

<p><i>Origin of the doctrine of alternate periods of repose and disorder.</i>&mdash;It
has been truly observed, that when we arrange the fossiliferous formations
in chronological order, they constitute a broken and defective series
of monuments: we pass without any intermediate gradations, from systems
of strata which are horizontal to other systems which are highly
inclined, from rocks of peculiar mineral composition to others which have
a character wholly distinct,&mdash;from one assemblage of organic remains to
another, in which frequently all the species, and most of the genera, are
different. These violations of continuity are so common, as to constitute
the rule rather than the exception, and they have been considered by
many geologists as conclusive in favor of sudden revolutions in the inanimate
and animate world. According to the speculations of some writers,
there have been in the past history of the planet alternate periods of
tranquillity and convulsion, the former enduring for ages, and resembling
that state of things now experienced by man: the other brief, transient,
and paroxysmal, giving rise to new mountains, seas, and valleys, annihilating
one set of organic beings, and ushering in the creation of another.</p>

<p>It will be the object of the present chapter to demonstrate, that these
theoretical views are not borne out by a fair interpretation of geological
monuments. It is true that in the solid framework of the globe, we
have a chronological chain of natural records, and that many links in this
chain are wanting; but a careful consideration of all the phenomena
will lead to the opinion that the series was originally defective,&mdash;that it
has been rendered still more so by time&mdash;that a great part of what remains
is inaccessible to man, and even of that fraction which is accessible,
nine-tenths are to this day unexplored.</p>

<p><i>How the facts may be explained by assuming a uniform series of
changes.</i>&mdash;The readiest way, perhaps, of persuading the reader that we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
may dispense with great and sudden revolutions in the geological order
of events, is by showing him how a regular and uninterrupted series of
changes in the animate and inanimate world may give rise to such breaks
in the sequence, and such unconformability of stratified rocks, as are
usually thought to imply convulsions and catastrophes. It is scarcely
necessary to state, that the order of events thus assumed to occur, for
the sake of illustration, must be in harmony with all the conclusions
legitimately drawn by geologists from the structure of the earth, and
must be equally in accordance with the changes observed by man to be
now going on in the living as well as in the inorganic creation. It may
be necessary in the present state of science to supply some part of the
assumed course of nature hypothetically; but if so, this must be done
without any violation of probability, and always consistently with the
analogy of what is known both of the past and present economy of our
system. Although the discussion of so comprehensive a subject must
carry the beginner far beyond his depth, it will also, it is hoped, stimulate
his curiosity, and prepare him to read some elementary treatises on
geology with advantage, and teach him the bearing on that science of
the changes now in progress on the earth. At the same time it may
enable him the better to understand the intimate connection between
the second and third books of this work, the former of which is occupied
with the changes in the inorganic, the latter with those of the organic
creation.</p>

<p>In pursuance, then, of the plan above proposed, I shall consider in
this chapter, first, what may be the course of fluctuation in the animate
world; secondly, the mode in which contemporaneous subterranean
movements affect the earth's crust; and, thirdly, the laws which regulate
the deposition of sediment.</p>

<h6>UNIFORMITY OF CHANGE CONSIDERED FIRST IN REFERENCE TO THE
LIVING CREATION.</h6>

<p>First, in regard to the vicissitudes of the living creation, all are agreed
that the sedimentary strata found in the earth's crust are divisible into
a variety of groups, more or less dissimilar in their organic remains and
mineral composition. The conclusion universally drawn from the study
and comparison of these fossiliferous groups is this, that at successive
periods distinct tribes of animals and plants have inhabited the land and
waters, and that the organic types of the newer formations are more
analogous to species now existing, than those of more ancient rocks. If
we then turn to the present state of the animate creation, and inquire
whether it has now become fixed and stationary, we discover that, on
the contrary, it is in a state of continual flux&mdash;that there are many
causes in action which tend to the extinction of species, and which are
conclusive against the doctrine of their unlimited durability. But natural
history has been successfully cultivated for so short a period, that a
few examples only of local, and perhaps but one or two of absolute, extirpation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
can as yet be proved, and these only where the interference of man
has been conspicuous. It will nevertheless appear evident, from the
facts and arguments detailed in the third book (from the thirty-seventh
to the forty-second chapters, inclusive) that man is not the only exterminating
agent; and that, independently of his intervention, the annihilation
of species is promoted by the multiplication and gradual diffusion
of every animal or plant. It will also appear, that every alteration
in the physical geography and climate of the globe cannot fail to have
the same tendency. If we proceed still farther, and inquire whether
new species are substituted from time to time for those which die out,
and whether there are certain laws appointed by the Author of Nature
to regulate such new creations, we find that the period of human observation
is as yet too short to afford data for determining so weighty a
question. All that can be done is to show that the successive introduction
of new species may be a constant part of the economy of the terrestrial
system, without our having any right to expect that we should
be in possession of direct proof of the fact. The appearance again and
again of new species may easily have escaped detection, since the numbers
of known animals and plants have augmented so rapidly within the
memory of persons now living, as to have doubled in some classes, and
quadrupled in others. It will also be remarked in the sequel (book iii.
chap. 43), that it must always be more easy if species proceeded originally
from single stocks, to prove that one which formerly abounded in
a given district has ceased to be, than that another has been called into
being for the first time. If, therefore, there be as yet only one or two
unequivocal instances of extinction, namely, those of the dodo and solitaire
(see ch. <a href="#Page_677">41</a>), it is scarcely reasonable as yet to hope that we should
be cognizant of a single instance of the first appearance of a new species.</p>

<p><i>Recent origin of man, and gradual approach in the tertiary fossils of
successive periods from an extinct to the recent fauna.</i>&mdash;The geologist,
however, if required to advance some fact which may lend countenance
to the opinion that in the most modern times, that is to say, after the
greater part of the existing fauna and flora were established on the
earth, there has still been a new species superadded, may point to man
himself as furnishing the required illustration&mdash;for man must be regarded
by the geologist as a creature of yesterday, not merely in reference to
the past history of the organic world, but also in relation to that particular
state of the animate creation of which he forms a part. The
comparatively modern introduction of the human race is proved by the
absence of the remains of man and his works, not only from all strata
containing a certain proportion of fossil shells of extinct species, but even
from a large part of the newest strata, in which all the fossil individuals
are referable to species still living.</p>

<p>To enable the reader to appreciate the full force of this evidence, I
shall give a slight sketch of the information obtained from the newer
strata, respecting fluctuations in the animate world, in times immediately
antecedent to the appearance of man.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
In tracing the series of fossiliferous formations from the more ancient
to the more modern, the first deposits in which we meet with assemblages
of organic remains, having a near analogy to the fauna of certain
parts of the globe in our own time, are those commonly called tertiary.
Even in the Eocene, or oldest subdivision of these tertiary
formations, some few of the testacea belong to existing species, although
almost all of them, and apparently all the associated vertebrata, are now
extinct. These Eocene strata are succeeded by a great number of
more modern deposits, which depart gradually in the character of their
fossils from the Eocene type, and approach more and more to that of
the living creation. In the present state of science, it is chiefly by the
aid of shells that we are enabled to arrive at these results, for of all
classes the testacea are the most generally diffused in a fossil state, and
may be called the medals principally employed by nature, in recording
the chronology of past events. In the Miocene deposits, which are
next in succession to the Eocene, we begin to find a considerable number,
although still a minority, of recent species, intermixed with some
fossils common to the preceding epoch. We then arrive at the Pliocene
strata, in which species now contemporary with man begin to preponderate,
and in the newest of which nine-tenths of the fossils agree
with species still inhabiting the neighboring sea.</p>

<p>In this passing from the older to the newer members of the tertiary
system we meet with many chasms, but none which separate entirely,
by a broad line of demarcation, one state of the organic world from another.
There are no signs of an abrupt termination of one fauna and
flora, and the starting into life of new and wholly distinct forms. Although
we are far from being able to demonstrate geologically an insensible
transition from the Eocene to the Miocene, or even from the latter
to the recent fauna, yet the more we enlarge and perfect our general
survey, the more nearly do we approximate to such a continuous series,
and the more gradually are we conducted from times when many of the
genera and nearly all the species were extinct, to those in which scarcely
a single species flourished which we do not know to exist at present.
Dr. A. Philippi, indeed, after an elaborate comparison of the fossil tertiary
shells of Sicily with those now living in the Mediterranean, announces
as the result of his examination that there are strata in that
island, which attest a very gradual passage from a period, when only
thirteen in a hundred of the shells were like the species now living in
the sea, to an era when the recent species had attained a proportion of
ninety-five in a hundred. There is therefore evidence, he says, in Sicily
of this revolution in the animate world having been effected "without
the intervention of any convulsion or abrupt changes, certain species
having from time to time died out, and others having been introduced,
until at length the existing fauna was elaborated."</p>

<p>It had often been objected that the evidence of fossil species occurring
in two consecutive formations, was confined to the testacea or zoophytes,
the characters of which are less marked and decisive than those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
afforded by the vertebrate animals. But Mr. Owen has lately insisted
on the important fact, that not a few of the quadrupeds which now inhabit
our island, and among others the horse, the ass, the hog, the
smaller wild ox, the goat, the red deer, the roe, the beaver, and many
of the diminutive rodents, are the same as those which once coexisted
with the mammoth, the great northern hippopotamus, two kinds of rhinoceros,
and other mammalia long since extinct. "A part," he observes,
"and not the whole of the modern tertiary fauna has perished,
and hence we may conclude that the cause of their destruction has not
been a violent and universal catastrophe from which none could
escape."<a name="FNanchor_257" id="FNanchor_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>Had we discovered evidence that man had come into the earth at a
period as early as that when a large number of the fossil quadrupeds
now living, and almost all the recent species of land, freshwater, and
marine shells were in existence, we should have been compelled to
ascribe a much higher antiquity to our species, than even the boldest
speculations of the ethnologist require, for no small part of the great
physical revolution depicted on the map of Europe (Pl. 3), before described,
took place very gradually after the recent testacea abounded
almost to the exclusion of the extinct. Thus, for example, in the deposits
called the "northern drift," or the glacial formation of Europe
and North America, the fossil marine shells can easily be identified with
species either now inhabiting the neighboring sea, or living in the seas
of higher latitudes. Yet they exhibit no memorials of the human race,
or of articles fabricated by the hand of man. Some of the newest of
these strata passing by the name of "raised beaches," occur at moderate
elevations on the coast of England, Scotland, and Ireland. Other
examples are met with on a more extended scale in Scandinavia, as at
the height of 200 feet at Uddevalla in Sweden, and at twice that elevation,
near Christiana, in Norway, also at an altitude of 600 or 700 feet
in places farther north. They consist of beds of sand and clay, filling
hollows in a district of granite and gneiss, and they must closely resemble
the accumulations of shelly matter now in progress at the bottom of
the Norwegian fiords. The rate at which the land is now rising in
Scandinavia, is far too irregular in different places to afford a safe
standard for estimating the minimum of time required for the upheaval
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
of the fundamental granite, and its marine shelly covering, to the height
of so many hundred feet; but according to the greatest average, of five
or six feet in a century, the period required would be very considerable,
and nearly the whole of it, as well as the antecedent epoch of submergence,
seems to have preceded the introduction of man into these parts
of the earth.</p>

<p>There are other post-tertiary formations of fluviatile origin, in the
centre of Europe, in which the absence of human remains is perhaps
still more striking, because, when formed, they must have been surrounded
by dry land. I allude to the silt or <i>loess</i> of the basin of the
Rhine, which must have gradually filled up the great valley of that
river since the time when its waters, and the contiguous lands, were inhabited
by the existing species of freshwater and terrestrial mollusks.
Showers of ashes, thrown out by some of the last eruptions of the Eifel
volcanoes, fell during the deposition of this fluviatile silt, and were interstratified
with it. But these volcanoes became exhausted, the valley
was re-excavated through the silt, and again reduced to its present form
before the period of human history. The study, therefore, of this shelly
silt reveals to us the history of a long series of events, which occurred
after the testacea now living inhabited the land and rivers of Europe,
and the whole terminated without any signs of the coming of man into
that part of the globe.</p>

<p>To cite a still more remarkable example, we observe in Sicily a lofty
table-land and hills, sometimes rising to the height of 3000 feet, capped
with a limestone, in which from 70 to 85 per cent. of the fossil testacea
are specifically identical with those now inhabiting the Mediterranean.
These calcareous and other argillaceous strata of the same age are intersected
by deep valleys which have been gradually formed by denudation,
but have not varied materially in width or depth since Sicily was
first colonized by the Greeks. The limestone, moreover, which is of so
late a date in geological chronology, was quarried for building those
ancient temples of Girgenti and Syracuse, of which the ruins carry us
back to a remote era in human history. If we are lost in conjectures
when speculating on the ages required to lift up these formations to the
height of several thousand feet above the sea, how much more remote
must be the era when the same rocks were gradually formed beneath
the waters!</p>

<p>To conclude, it appears that, in going back from the recent to the
Eocene period, we are carried by many successive steps from the fauna
now contemporary with man to an assemblage of fossil species wholly
different from those now living. In this retrospect we have not yet succeeded
in tracing back a perfect transition from the recent to an extinct
fauna; but there are usually so many species in common to the groups
which stand next in succession as to show that there is no great chasm,
no signs of a crisis when one class of organic beings was annihilated to
give place suddenly to another. This analogy, therefore, derived from
a period of the earth's history which can best be compared with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
present state of things, and more thoroughly investigated than any
other, leads to the conclusion that the extinction and creation of species,
has been and is the result of a slow and gradual change in the organic
world.</p>

<h6>UNIFORMITY OF CHANGE CONSIDERED, SECONDLY, IN REFERENCE TO SUBTERRANEAN
MOVEMENTS.</h6>

<p>To pass on to another of the three topics before proposed for discussion,
the reader will find, in the account given in the second book of the
earthquakes recorded in history, that certain countries have, from time
immemorial, been rudely shaken again and again, while others, comprising
by far the largest part of the globe, have remained to all appearance
motionless. In the regions of convulsion rocks have been rent
asunder, the surface has been forced up into ridges, chasms have opened,
or the ground throughout large spaces has been permanently lifted up
above or let down below its former level. In the regions of tranquillity
some areas have remained at rest, but others have been ascertained by
a comparison of measurements, made at different periods, to have risen
by an insensible motion, as in Sweden, or to have subsided very slowly,
as in Greenland. That these same movements, whether ascending or
descending, have continued for ages in the same direction has been
established by geological evidence. Thus, we find both on the east and
west coast of Sweden, that ground which formerly constituted the bottom
of the Baltic and of the ocean has been lifted up to an elevation of
several hundred feet above high-water mark. The rise within the historical
period has not amounted to many yards, but the greater extent
of antecedent upheaval is proved by the occurrence in inland spots,
several hundred feet high, of deposits filled with fossil shells of species
now living either in the ocean or the Baltic.</p>

<p>To detect proofs of slow and gradual subsidence must in general be
more difficult; but the theory which accounts for the form of circular
coral reefs and lagoon islands, and which will be explained in the last
chapter of the third book, will satisfy the reader that there are spaces
on the globe, several thousand miles in circumference, throughout which
the downward movement has predominated for ages, and yet the land
has never, in a single instance, gone down suddenly for several hundred
feet at once. Yet geology demonstrates that the persistency of subterranean
movements in one direction has not been perpetual throughout
all past time. There have been great oscillations of level by which
a surface of dry land has been submerged to a depth of several thousand
feet, and then at a period long subsequent raised again and made
to emerge. Nor have the regions now motionless been always at rest;
and some of those which are at present the theatres of reiterated earthquakes
have formerly enjoyed a long continuance of tranquillity. But
although disturbances have ceased after having long prevailed, or have
recommenced after a suspension for ages, there has been no universal
disruption of the earth's crust or desolation of the surface since times
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
the most remote. The non-occurrence of such a general convulsion is
proved by the perfect horizontally now retained by some of the most
ancient fossiliferous strata throughout wide areas.</p>

<p><i>Inferences derived from unconformable strata.</i>&mdash;That the subterranean
forces have visited different parts of the globe at successive periods, is
inferred chiefly from the unconformability of strata belonging to groups
of different ages. Thus, for example, on the borders of Wales and
Shropshire we find the slaty beds of the ancient Silurian system curved
and vertical, while the beds of the overlying carboniferous shale and
sandstone are horizontal. All are agreed, that in such a case the older
set of strata had suffered great dislocation before the deposition of the
newer or carboniferous beds, and that these last have never since been
convulsed by any movements of excessive violence. But the strata of
the inferior group suffered only a local derangement, and rocks of the
same age are by no means found everywhere in a curved or vertical
position. In various parts of Europe, and particularly near Lake Wener
in the south of Sweden, and in many parts of Russia, beds of the same
Silurian system maintain the most perfect horizontality; and a similar
observation may be made respecting limestones and shales of the like
antiquity in the great lake district of Canada and the United States.
They are still as flat and horizontal as when first formed; yet since
their origin not only have most of the actual mountain-chains been uplifted,
but the very rocks of which those mountains are composed have
been formed.</p>

<p>It would be easy to multiply instances of similar unconformability in
formations of other ages; but a few more will suffice. The coal measures
before alluded to as horizontal on the borders of Wales are vertical
in the Mendip Hills in Somersetshire, where the overlying beds of
the New Red Sandstone are horizontal. Again, in the Wolds of Yorkshire
the last mentioned sandstone supports on its curved and inclined
beds the horizontal Chalk. The Chalk again is vertical on the flanks
of the Pyrenees, and the tertiary strata repose unconformably upon it.</p>

<p><i>Consistency of local disturbances with general uniformity.</i>&mdash;As almost
every country supplies illustrations of the same phenomena, they
who advocate the doctrine of alternate periods of disorder and repose
may appeal to the facts above described, as proving that every district
has been by turns convulsed by earthquakes and then respited
for ages from convulsions. But so it might with equal truth be
affirmed that every part of Europe has been visited alternately by winter
and summer, although it has always been winter and always summer
in some part of the planet, and neither of these seasons has ever
reigned simultaneously over the entire globe. They have been always
shifting about from place to place; but the vicissitudes which recur
thus annually in a single spot are never allowed to interfere with the
invariable uniformity of seasons throughout the whole planet.</p>

<p>So, in regard to subterranean movements, the theory of the perpetual
uniformity of the force which they exert on the earth's crust is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
quite consistent with the admission of their alternate development and
suspension for indefinite periods within limited geographical areas.</p>

<h6>UNIFORMITY OF CHANGE CONSIDERED, THIRDLY, IN REFERENCE TO
SEDIMENTARY DEPOSITION.</h6>

<p>It now remains to speak of the laws governing the deposition of
new strata. If we survey the surface of the globe we immediately
perceive that it is divisible into areas of deposition and non-deposition,
or, in other words, at any given time there are spaces which are the
recipients, others which are not the recipients of sedimentary matter.
No new strata, for example, are thrown down on dry land, which
remains the same from year to year; whereas, in many parts of the
bottom of seas and lakes, mud, sand, and pebbles are annually spread
out by rivers and currents. There are also great masses of limestone
growing in some seas, or in mid-ocean, chiefly composed of corals and
shells.</p>

<p><i>No sediment deposited on dry land.</i>&mdash;As to the dry land, so far
from being the receptacle of fresh accessions of matter, it is exposed
almost everywhere to waste away. Forests may be as dense and
lofty as those of Brazil, and may swarm with quadrupeds, birds, and
insects, yet at the end of ten thousand years one layer of black
mould, a few inches thick, may be the sole representative of those
myriads of trees, leaves, flowers, and fruits, those innumerable bones
and skeletons of birds, quadrupeds, and reptiles, which tenanted the
fertile region. Should this land be at length submerged, the waves
of the sea may wash away in a few hours the scanty covering of
mould, and it may merely impart a darker shade of color to the next
stratum of marl, sand, or other matter newly thrown down. So also
at the bottom of the ocean where no sediment is accumulating, sea-weed,
zoophytes, fish, and even shells, may multiply for ages and decompose,
leaving no vestige of their form or substance behind. Their
decay, in water, although more slow, is as certain and eventually as
complete as in the open air. Nor can they be perpetuated for indefinite
periods in a fossil state, unless imbedded in some matrix which is
impervious to water, or which at least does not allow a free percolation
of that fluid, impregnated as it usually is, with a slight quantity of carbonic
or other acid. Such a free percolation may be prevented either
by the mineral nature of the matrix itself, or by the superposition of an
impermeable stratum: but if unimpeded, the fossil shell or bone will be
dissolved and removed, particle after particle, and thus entirely effaced,
unless petrifaction or the substitution of mineral for organic matter happen
to take place.</p>

<p>That there has been land as well as sea at all former geological periods,
we know from the fact, that fossil trees and terrestrial plants are
imbedded in rocks of every age. Occasionally lacustrine and fluviatile
shells, insects, or the bones of amphibious or land reptiles, point to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
same conclusion. The existence of dry land at all periods of the past
implies, as before mentioned, the partial deposition of sediment, or its
limitation to certain areas; and the next point to which I shall call
the reader's attention, is the shifting of these areas from one region to
another.</p>

<p>First, then, variations in the site of sedimentary deposition are
brought about independently of subterranean movements. There is
always a slight change from year to year, or from century to century.
The sediment of the Rhone, for example, thrown into the Lake of
Geneva, is now conveyed to a spot a mile and a half distant from that
where it accumulated in the tenth century, and six miles from the point
where the delta began originally to form. We may look forward to
the period when this lake will be filled up, and then the distribution of
the transported matter will be suddenly altered, for the mud and sand
brought down from the Alps will thenceforth, instead of being deposited
near Geneva, be carried nearly 200 miles southwards, where the Rhone
enters the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>In the deltas of large rivers, such as those of the Ganges and Indus,
the mud is first carried down for many centuries through one arm, and
on this being stopped up it is discharged by another, and may then
enter the sea at a point 50 or 100 miles distant from its first receptacle.
The direction of marine currents is also liable to be changed by various
accidents, as by the heaping up of new sand-banks, or the wearing
away of cliffs and promontories.</p>

<p>But, secondly, all these causes of fluctuation in the sedimentary areas
are entirely subordinate to those great upward or downward movements
of land which have been already described as prevailing over large
tracts of the globe. By such elevation or subsidence certain spaces are
gradually submerged, or made gradually to emerge:&mdash;in the one case
sedimentary deposition may be suddenly renewed after having been suspended
for ages, in the other as suddenly made to cease after having
continued for an indefinite period.</p>

<p><i>Causes of variation in mineral character of successive sedimentary
groups.</i>&mdash;If deposition be renewed after a long interval, the new strata
will usually differ greatly from the sedimentary rocks previously formed
in the same place, and especially if the older rocks have suffered derangement,
which implies a change in the physical geography of the
district since the previous conveyance of sediment to the same spot. It
may happen, however, that, even when the inferior group is horizontal
and conformable to the upper strata, these last may still differ entirely
in mineral character, because since the origin of the older formation the
geography of some distant country has been altered. In that country
rocks before concealed may have become exposed by denudation; volcanoes
may have burst out and covered the surface with scori&aelig; and
lava, or new lakes may have been formed by subsidence; and other fluctuations
may have occurred, by which the materials brought down from
thence by rivers to the sea have acquired a distinct mineral character.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
It is well known that the stream of the Mississippi is charged with
sediment of a different color from that of the Arkansas and Red Rivers,
which are tinged with red mud, derived from rocks of porphyry in
"the far west." The waters of the Uruguay, says Darwin, draining a
granitic country, are clear and black, those of the Parana, red.<a name="FNanchor_258" id="FNanchor_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> The
mud with which the Indus is loaded, says Burnes, is of a clayey hue,
that of the Chenab, on the other hand, is reddish, that of the Sutlej is
more pale.<a name="FNanchor_259" id="FNanchor_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> The same causes which make these several rivers, sometimes
situated at no great distance the one from the other, to differ
greatly in the character of their sediment, will make the waters draining
the same country at different epochs, especially before and after great
revolutions in physical geography, to be entirely dissimilar. It is
scarcely necessary to add, that marine currents will be affected in an
analogous manner in consequence of the formation of new shoals, the
emergence of new islands, the subsidence of others, the gradual waste
of neighboring coasts, the growth of new deltas, the increase of coral
reefs, and other changes.</p>

<p><i>Why successive sedimentary groups contain distinct fossils.</i>&mdash;If, in
the next place, we assume, for reasons before stated, a continual extinction
of species and introduction of others into the globe, it will then
follow that the fossils of strata formed at two distant periods on the
same spot, will differ even more certainly than the mineral composition
of the same. For rocks of the same kind have sometimes been reproduced
in the same district after a long interval of time, whereas there
are no facts leading to the opinion that species which have once died
out have ever been reproduced. The submergence then of land must
be often attended by the commencement of a new class of sedimentary
deposits, characterized by a new set of fossil animals and plants, while
the reconversion of the bed of the sea into land may arrest at once
and for an indefinite time the formation of geological monuments.
Should the land again sink, strata will again be formed; but one or
many entire revolutions in animal or vegetable life may have been completed
in the interval.</p>

<p><i>Conditions requisite for the original completeness of a fossiliferous
series.</i>&mdash;If we infer, for reasons before explained, that fluctuations in
the animate world are brought about by the slow and successive
removal and creation of species, we shall be convinced that a rare combination
of circumstances alone can give rise to such a series of strata
as will bear testimony to a gradual passage from one state of organic
life to another. To produce such strata nothing less will be requisite
than the fortunate coincidence of the following conditions: first, a
never-failing supply of sediment in the same region throughout a period
of vast duration; secondly, the fitness of the deposit in every part for
the permanent preservation of imbedded fossils; and, thirdly, a gradual
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
subsidence to prevent the sea or lake from being filled up and converted
into land.</p>

<p>It will appear in the chapter on coral reefs,<a name="FNanchor_260" id="FNanchor_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> that, in certain parts of
the Pacific and Indian Oceans, most of these conditions, if not all, are
complied with, and the constant growth of coral, keeping pace with the
sinking of the bottom of the sea, seems to have gone on so slowly, for
such indefinite periods, that the signs of a gradual change in organic
life might probably be detected in that quarter of the globe, if we
could explore its submarine geology. Instead of the growth of coralline
limestone, let us suppose, in some other place, the continuous deposition
of fluviatile mud and sand, such as the Ganges and Brahmapootra
have poured for thousands of years into the Bay of Bengal.
Part of this bay, although of considerable depth, might at length be
filled up before an appreciable amount of change was effected in the
fish, mollusca, and other inhabitants of the sea and neighboring land.
But, if the bottom be lowered by sinking at the same rate that it is
raised by fluviatile mud, the bay can never be turned into dry land.
In that case one new layer of matter may be superimposed upon
another for a thickness of many thousand feet, and the fossils of the
inferior beds may differ greatly from those entombed in the uppermost,
yet every intermediate gradation may be indicated in the passage from
an older to a newer assemblage of species. Granting, however, that
such an unbroken sequence of monuments may thus be elaborated in
certain parts of the sea, and that the strata happen to be all of them
well adapted to preserve the included fossils from decomposition, how
many accidents must still concur before these submarine formations will
be laid open to our investigation! The whole deposit must first be
raised several thousand feet, in order to bring into view the very foundation;
and during the process of exposure the superior beds must not
be entirely swept away by denudation.</p>

<p>In the first place, the chances are as three to one against the mere
emergence of the mass above the waters, because three-fourths of the
globe are covered by the ocean. But if it be upheaved and made to
constitute part of the dry land, it must also, before it can be available
for our instruction, become part of that area already surveyed by geologists;
and this area comprehends perhaps less than a tenth of the
whole earth. In this small fraction of land already explored, and still
very imperfectly known, we are required to find a set of strata, originally
of limited extent, and probably much lessened by subsequent
denudation.</p>

<p>Yet it is precisely because we do not encounter at every step the
evidence of such gradations from one state of the organic world to
another, that so many geologists embrace the doctrine of great and
sudden revolutions in the history of the animate world. Not content
with simply availing themselves, for the convenience of classification, of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
those gaps and chasms which here and there interrupt the continuity of
the chronological series, as at present known, they deduce, from the
frequency of these breaks in the chain of records, an irregular mode of
succession in the events themselves both in the organic and inorganic
world. But, besides that some links of the chain which once existed
are now clearly lost and others concealed from view, we have good reason
to suspect that it was never complete originally. It may undoubtedly
be said, that strata have been always forming somewhere, and
therefore at every moment of past time nature has added a page to her
archives; but, in reference to this subject, it should be remembered
that we can never hope to compile a consecutive history by gathering
together monuments which were originally detached and scattered over
the globe. For as the species of organic beings contemporaneously
inhabiting remote regions are distinct, the fossils of the first of several
periods which may be preserved in any one country, as in America,
for example, will have no connection with those of a second period
found in India, and will therefore no more enable us to trace the signs
of a gradual change in the living creation, than a fragment of Chinese
history will fill up a blank in the political annals of Europe.</p>

<p>The absence of any deposits of importance containing recent shells in
Chili, or anywhere on the western coast of South America, naturally
led Mr. Darwin to the conclusion that "where the bed of the sea is
either stationary or rising, circumstances are far less favorable than
where the level is sinking to the accumulation of conchiferous strata of
sufficient thickness and extension to resist the average vast amount of
denudation."<a name="FNanchor_261" id="FNanchor_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> An examination of the superficial clay, sand, and gravel
of the most modern date in Norway and Sweden, where the land is also
rising, would incline us to admit a similar proposition. Yet in these
cases there has been a supply of sediment from the waste of the coast
and the interior, especially in Patagonia and Chili. Nevertheless wherever
the bottom of the sea has been continually elevated, the total
thickness of sedimentary matter accumulating at depths suited to the
habitation of most of the species of shells can never be great, nor can
the deposits be thickly covered by superincumbent matter, so as to be
consolidated by pressure. When they are upheaved, therefore, the
waves on the beach will bear down and disperse the loose materials;
whereas if the bed of the sea subsides slowly, a mass of strata containing
abundance of such species as live at moderate depths may increase
in thickness to any amount, and may extend over a broad area, as the
water gradually encroaches on the land. If, then, at particular periods,
as in the Miocene epoch, for example, both in Europe and North America,
contemporaneous shelly deposits have originated, and have been
preserved at very distant points, it may arise from the prevalence at
that period of simultaneous subsidence throughout very wide areas.
The absence in the same quarters of the globe of strata marking the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
ages which immediately succeeded, may be accounted for by supposing
that the level of the bed of the sea and the adjoining land was stationary
or was undergoing slow upheaval.</p>

<p>How far some of the great violations of continuity which now exist in
the chronological table of fossiliferous rocks, will hereafter be removed
or lessened, must at present be mere matter of conjecture. The hiatus
which exists in Great Britain between the fossils of the Lias and those
of the Magnesian Limestone, is supplied in Germany by the rich fauna
and flora of the Muschelkalk, Keuper, and Bunter Sandstein, which we
know to be of a date precisely intermediate; those three formations
being interposed in Germany between others which agree perfectly in
their organic remains with our Lias and Magnesian Limestone. Until
lately the fossils of the Coal-measures were separated from those of the
antecedent Silurian group by a very abrupt and decided line of demarcation;
but recent discoveries have brought to light in Devonshire, Belgium,
the Eifel, and Westphalia, the remains of a fauna of an intervening
period. This connecting link is furnished by the fossil shells, fish, and
corals of the Devonian or Old Red Sandstone group, and some species
of this newly intercalated fauna are found to be common to it and the
subjacent Silurian rocks, while other species belong to it in common
with the Coal-measures. We have also in like manner had some success
of late years in diminishing the hiatus which still separates the Cretaceous
and Eocene periods in Europe. Still we must expect, for reasons
before stated, that some such chasms will forever continue to occur
in some parts of our sedimentary series.</p>

<p><i>Consistency of the theory of gradual change with the existence of great
breaks in the series.</i>&mdash;To return to the general argument pursued in this
chapter, it is assumed, for reasons above explained, that a slow change
of species is in simultaneous operation everywhere throughout the habitable
surface of sea and land; whereas the fossilization of plants and
animals is confined to those areas where new strata are produced.
These areas, as we have seen, are always shifting their position; so that
the fossilizing process, by means of which the commemoration of the
particular state of the organic world, at any given time, is affected, may
be said to move about, visiting and revisiting different tracts in succession.</p>

<p>To make still more clear the supposed working of this machinery, I
shall compare it to a somewhat analogous case that might be imagined
to occur in the history of human affairs. Let the mortality of the population
of a large country represent the successive extinction of species,
and the births of new individuals the introduction of new species.
While these fluctuations are gradually taking place everywhere, suppose
commissioners to be appointed to visit each province of the country
in succession, taking an exact account of the number, names, and individual
peculiarities of all the inhabitants, and leaving in each district a
register containing a record of this information. If, after the completion
of one census, another is immediately made on the same plan, and then
another, there will, at last, be a series of statistical documents in each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
province. When those belonging to any one province are arranged in
chronological order, the contents of such as stand next to each other
will differ according to the length of the intervals of time between the
taking of each census. If, for example, there are sixty provinces, and
all the registers are made in a single year, and renewed annually, the
number of births and deaths will be so small, in proportion to the whole
of the inhabitants, during the interval between the compiling of the two
consecutive documents, that the individuals described in such documents
will be nearly identical; whereas, if the survey of each of the sixty
provinces occupies all the commissioners for a whole year, so that they
are unable to revisit the same place until the expiration of sixty years,
there will then be an almost entire discordance between the persons
enumerated in two consecutive registers in the same province. There
are, undoubtedly, other causes besides the mere quantity of time, which
may augment or diminish the amount of discrepancy. Thus, at some
periods a pestilential disease may have lessened the average duration of
human life, or a variety of circumstances may have caused the births to
be unusually numerous, and the population to multiply; or, a province
may be suddenly colonized by persons migrating from surrounding districts.</p>

<p>These exceptions may be compared to the accelerated rate of fluctuation
in the fauna and flora of a particular region, in which the climate
and physical geography may be undergoing an extraordinary degree of
alteration.</p>

<p>But I must remind the reader, that the case above proposed has no
pretensions to be regarded as an exact parallel to the geological phenomena
which I desire to illustrate; for the commissioners are supposed
to visit the different provinces in rotation; whereas the commemorating
processes by which organic remains become fossilized, although they
are always shifting from one area to the other, are yet very irregular in
their movements. They may abandon and revisit many spaces again
and again before they once approach another district; and, besides this
source of irregularity, it may often happen that, while the depositing
process is suspended, denudation may take place, which may be compared
to the occasional destruction by fire or other causes of some of
the statistical documents before mentioned. It is evident that, where
such accidents occur, the want of continuity in the series may become
indefinitely great, and that the monuments which follow next in succession
will by no means be equidistant from each other in point of time.</p>

<p>If this train of reasoning be admitted, the occasional distinctness of
the fossil remains, in formations immediately in contact, would be a
necessary consequence of the existing laws of sedimentary deposition
and subterranean movement, accompanied by a constant mortality and
renovation of species.</p>

<p>As all the conclusions above insisted on are directly opposed to opinions
still popular, I shall add another comparison, in the hope of preventing
any possible misapprehension of the argument. Suppose we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
had discovered two buried cities at the foot of Vesuvius, immediately
superimposed upon each other, with a great mass of tuff and lava intervening,
just as Portici and Resina, if now covered with ashes, would
overlie Herculaneum. An antiquary might possibly be entitled to infer,
from the inscriptions on public edifices, that the inhabitants of the inferior
and older city were Greeks, and those of the modern towns Italians.
But he would reason very hastily if he also concluded from these data
that there had been a sudden change from the Greek to the Italian language
in Campania. But if he afterwards found <i>three</i> buried cities, one
above the other, the intermediate one being Roman, while, as in the
former example, the lowest was Greek and the uppermost Italian, he
would then perceive the fallacy of his former opinion, and would begin
to suspect that the catastrophes by which the cities were inhumed
might have no relation whatever to the fluctuations in the language of
the inhabitants; and that, as the Roman tongue had evidently intervened
between the Greek and Italian, so many other dialects may have been
spoken in succession, and the passage from the Greek to the Italian may
have been very gradual; some terms growing obsolete, while others
were introduced from time to time.</p>

<p>If this antiquary could have shown that the volcanic paroxysms of
Vesuvius were so governed as that cities should be buried one above the
other, just as often as any variation occurred in the language of the
inhabitants, then, indeed, the abrupt passage from a Greek to a Roman,
and from a Roman to an Italian city, would afford proof of fluctuations
no less sudden in the language of the people.</p>

<p>So, in Geology, if we could assume that it is part of the plan of
Nature to preserve, in every region of the globe, an unbroken series of
monuments to commemorate the vicissitudes of the organic creation, we
might infer the sudden extirpation of species, and the simultaneous
introduction of others, as often as two formations in contact are found to
include dissimilar organic fossils. But we must shut our eyes to the
whole economy of the existing causes, aqueous, igneous, and organic, if
we fail to perceive <i>that such in not the plan of Nature</i>.</p>

<p><i>Concluding remarks on the identity of the ancient and present system
of terrestrial changes.</i>&mdash;I shall now conclude the discussion of a question
with which we have been occupied since the beginning of the fifth
chapter; namely, whether there has been any interruption, from the
remotest periods, of one uniform system of change in the animate and
inanimate world. We were induced to enter into that inquiry by reflecting
how much the progress of opinion in Geology had been influenced
by the assumption that the analogy was slight in kind, and still more
slight in degree, between the causes which produced the former revolutions
of the globe, and those now in every-day operation. It appeared
clear that the earlier geologists had not only a scanty acquaintance with
existing changes, but were singularly unconscious of the amount of their
ignorance. With the presumption naturally inspired by this unconsciousness,
they had no hesitation in deciding at once that time could never
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
enable the existing powers of nature to work out changes of great magnitude,
still less such important revolutions as those which are brought to
light by Geology. They, therefore, felt themselves at liberty to indulge
their imaginations in guessing at what <i>might be</i>, rather than inquiring
<i>what is</i>; in other words, they employed themselves in conjecturing
what might have been the course of nature at a remote period, rather
than in the investigation of what was the course of nature in their own
times.</p>

<p>It appeared to them more philosophical to speculate on the possibilities
of the past, than patiently to explore the realities of the present;
and having invented theories under the influence of such maxims, they
were consistently unwilling to test their validity by the criterion of their
accordance with the ordinary operations of nature. On the contrary,
the claims of each new hypothesis to credibility appeared enhanced by
the great contrast, in kind or intensity, of the causes referred to, and
those now in operation.</p>

<p>Never was there a dogma more calculated to foster indolence, and
to blunt the keen edge of curiosity, than this assumption of the discordance
between the ancient and existing causes of change. It produced a
state of mind unfavorable in the highest degree to the candid reception
of the evidence of those minute but incessant alterations which every
part of the earth's surface is undergoing, and by which the condition of
its living inhabitants is continually made to vary. The student, instead
of being encouraged with the hope of interpreting the enigmas presented
to him in the earth's structure,&mdash;instead of being prompted to undertake
laborious inquiries into the natural history of the organic world, and
the complicated effects of the igneous and aqueous causes now in operation,
was taught to despond from the first. Geology, it was affirmed,
could never rise to the rank of an exact science,&mdash;the greater number of
phenomena must forever remain inexplicable, or only be partially elucidated
by ingenious conjectures. Even the mystery which invested the
subject was said to constitute one of its principal charms, affording, as it
did, full scope to the fancy to indulge in a boundless field of speculation.</p>

<p>The course directly opposed to this method of philosophizing consists
in an earnest and patient inquiry, how far geological appearances are
reconcilable with the effect of changes now in progress, or which may
be in progress in regions inaccessible to us, and of which the reality is
attested by volcanoes and subterranean movements. It also endeavors
to estimate the aggregate result of ordinary operations multiplied by
time, and cherishes a sanguine hope that the resources to be derived
from observation and experiment, or from the study of nature such as
she now is, are very far from-being exhausted. For this reason all
theories are rejected which involve the assumption of sudden and violent
catastrophes and revolutions of the whole earth, and its inhabitants,&mdash;theories
which are restrained by no reference to existing analogies, and
in which a desire is manifested to cut, rather than patiently to untie, the
Gordian knot.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
We have now, at least, the advantage of knowing, from experience,
that an opposite method has always put geologists on the road that
leads to truth,&mdash;suggesting views which, although imperfect at first,
have been found capable of improvement, until at last adopted by universal
consent; while the method of speculating on a former distinct
state of things and causes, has led invariably to a multitude of contradictory
systems, which have been overthrown one after the other,&mdash;have
been found incapable of modification,&mdash;and which have often required
to be precisely reversed.</p>

<p>The remainder of this work will be devoted to an investigation of the
changes now going on in the crust of the earth and its inhabitants.
The importance which the student will attach to such researches will
mainly depend in the degree of confidence which he feels in the principles
above expounded. If he firmly believes in the resemblance
or identity of the ancient and present system of terrestrial changes, he
will regard every fact collected respecting the causes in diurnal action
as affording him a key to the interpretation of some mystery in the
past. Events which have occurred at the most distant periods in
the animate and inanimate world, will be acknowledged to throw light
on each other, and the deficiency of our information respecting some
of the most obscure parts of the present creation will be removed. For
as, by studying the external configuration of the existing land and its
inhabitants, we may restore in imagination the appearance of the ancient
continents which have passed away, so may we obtain from the
deposits of ancient seas and lakes an insight into the nature of the subaqueous
processes now in operation, and of many forms of organic life,
which, though now existing, are veiled from sight. Rocks, also, produced
by subterranean fire in former ages, at great depths in the bowels
of the earth, present us, when upraised by gradual movements, and
exposed to the light of heaven, with an image of those changes which
the deep-seated volcano may now occasion in the nether regions.
Thus, although we are mere sojourners on the surface of the planet,
chained to a mere point in space, enduring but for a moment of time,
the human mind is not only enabled to number worlds beyond the
unassisted ken of mortal eye, but to trace the events of indefinite
ages before the creation of our race, and is not even withheld from
penetrating into the dark secrets of the ocean, or the interior of the
solid globe; free, like the spirit which the poet described as animating
the universe,</p>

<p><i>Division of the subject.</i>&mdash;Geology was defined to be the science
which investigates the former changes that have taken place in the
organic as well as in the inorganic kingdoms of nature. As vicissitudes
in the inorganic world are most apparent, and as on them all fluctuations
in the animate creation must in a great measure depend, they
may claim our first consideration. The great agents of change in the
inorganic world may be divided into two principal classes, the aqueous
and the igneous. To the aqueous belong Rain, Rivers, Torrents,
Springs, Currents, and Tides; to the igneous, Volcanoes, and Earthquakes.
Both these classes are instruments of decay as well as of
reproduction; but they may also be regarded as antagonist forces.
For the aqueous agents are incessantly laboring to reduce the inequalities
of the earth's surface to a level; while the igneous are equally
active in restoring the unevenness of the external crust, partly by heaping
up new matter in certain localities, and partly by depressing one
portion, and forcing out another, of the earth's envelope.</p>

<p>It is difficult, in a scientific arrangement, to give an accurate view
of the combined effects of so many forces in simultaneous operation;
because, when we consider them separately, we cannot easily estimate
either the extent of their efficacy, or the kind of results which they
produce. We are in danger, therefore, when we attempt to examine
the influence exerted singly by each, of overlooking the modifications
which they produce on one another; and these are so complicated,
that sometimes the igneous and aqueous forces co-operate to produce
a joint effect, to which neither of them unaided by the other could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
give rise,&mdash;as when repeated earthquakes unite with running water
to widen a valley; or when a thermal spring rises up from a great
depth, and conveys the mineral ingredients with which it is impregnated
from the interior of the earth to the surface. Sometimes the
organic combine with the inorganic causes; as when a reef, composed
of shells and corals, protects one line of coast from the destroying
power of tides or currents, and turns them against some other point;
or when drift timber, floated into a lake, fills a hollow to which the
stream would not have had sufficient velocity to convey earthy sediment.</p>

<p>It is necessary, however, to divide our observations on these various
causes, and to classify them systematically, endeavoring as much as
possible to keep in view that the effects in nature are mixed and not
simple, as they may appear in an artificial arrangement.</p>

<p>In treating, in the first place, of the aqueous causes, we may consider
them under two divisions; first, those which are connected with
the circulation of water from the land to the sea, under which are included
all the phenomena of rain, rivers, glaciers, and springs; secondly,
those which arise from the movements of water in lakes, seas, and
the ocean, wherein are comprised the phenomena of waves, tides, and
currents. In turning our attention to the former division, we find that
the effects of rivers may be subdivided into, first, those of a destroying
and transporting, and, secondly, those of a renovating nature; in the
former are included the erosion of rocks and the transportation of matter
to lower levels; in the renovating class, the formation of deltas by
the influx of sediment, and the shallowing of seas; but these processes
are so intimately related to each other, that it will not always be possible
to consider them under their separate heads.</p>

<p><i>Fall of Rain.</i>&mdash;It is well known that the capacity of the atmosphere
to absorb aqueous vapor, and hold it in suspension, increases with every
increment of temperature. This capacity is also found to augment in a
higher ratio than the augmentation of the heat. Hence, as was first
suggested by the geologist, Dr. Hutton, when two volumes of air, of
different temperatures, both saturated with moisture, mingle together,
clouds and rain are produced, for a mean degree of heat having resulted
from the union of the two moist airs, the excess of vapor previously
held in suspension by the warmer of the two is given out, and if it be in
sufficient abundance is precipitated in the form of rain.</p>

<p>As the temperature of the atmosphere diminishes gradually from the
equator towards the pole, the evaporation of water and the quantity of
rain diminish also. According to Humboldt's computation, the average
annual depth of rain at the equator is 96 inches, while in lat. 45&deg;
it is only 29 inches, and in lat. 60&deg; not more than 17 inches. But
there are so many disturbing causes, that the actual discharge, in any
given locality, may deviate very widely from this rule. In England, for
example, where the average fall at London is 24&frac12; inches, as ascertained
at the Greenwich Observatory, there is such irregularity in some districts,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
that while at Whitehaven, in Cumberland, there fell in 1849, 32
inches, the quantity of rain in Borrowdale, near Keswick (only 15 miles
to the westward), was no less than 142 inches!<a name="FNanchor_262" id="FNanchor_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> In like manner, in
India, Colonel Sykes found by observations made in 1847 and 1848,
that at places situated between 17&deg; and 18&deg; north lat., on a line drawn
across the Western Ghauts in the Deccan, the fall of rain varied from
21 to 219 inches.<a name="FNanchor_263" id="FNanchor_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> The annual average in Bengal is probably below
80 inches, yet Dr. G. Hooker witnessed at Churrapoonjee, in the year
1850, a fall of 30 inches in 24 hours, and in the same place during a
residence of six months (from June to November) 530 inches! This
occurred on the south face of the Khasia (or Garrow) mountains in
Eastern Bengal (see <a href="#f25">map</a>, Chap. XVIII.), where the depth during the
whole of the same year probably exceeded 600 inches. So extraordinary
a discharge of water, which, as we shall presently see, is very local,
may be thus accounted for. Warm, southerly winds, blowing over
the Bay of Bengal, and becoming laden with vapor during their passage,
reach the low level delta of the Ganges and Brahmapootra, where
the ordinary heat exceeds that of the sea, and where evaporation is constantly
going on from countless marshes and the arms of the great
rivers. A mingling of two masses of damp air of different temperatures
probably causes the fall of 70 or 80 inches of rain, which takes place
on the plains. The monsoon having crossed the delta, impinges on the
Khasia mountains, which rise abruptly from the plain to a mean elevation
of between 4000 and 5000 feet. Here the wind not only encounters
the cold air of the mountains, but, what is far more effective as a
refrigerating cause, the aerial current is made to flow upwards, and to
ascend to a height of several thousand feet above the sea. Both the
air and the vapor contained in it, being thus relieved of much atmospheric
pressure, expand suddenly, and are cooled by rarefaction. The
vapor is condensed, and about 500 inches of rain are thrown down annually,
nearly twenty times as much as falls in Great Britain in a year,
and almost all of it poured down in six months. The channel of every
torrent and river is swollen at this season, and much sandstone horizontally
stratified, and other rocks are reduced to sand and gravel by the
flooded streams. So great is the superficial waste (or <i>denudation</i>), that
what would otherwise be a rich and luxuriantly wooded region, is converted
into a wild and barren moorland.</p>

<p>After the current of warm air has been thus drained of a large portion
of its moisture, it still continues its northerly course to the opposite
flank of the Khasia range, only 20 miles farther north, and here the
fall of rain is reduced to 70 inches in the year. The same wind then
blows northwards across the valley of the Brahmapootra, and at length
arrives so dry and exhausted at the Bhootan Himalaya (lat. 28&deg; N.), that
those mountains, up to the height of 5000 feet, are naked and sterile,
and all their outer valleys arid and dusty. The aerial current still continuing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
its northerly course and ascending to a higher region, becomes
further cooled, condensation again ensues, and Bhootan, above 5000
feet, is densely clothed with vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_264" id="FNanchor_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<p>In another part of India, immediately to the westward, similar phenomena
are repeated. The same warm and humid winds, copiously
charged with aqueous vapor from the Bay of Bengal, hold their course
due north for 300 miles across the flat and hot plains of the Ganges,
till they encounter the lofty Sikkim mountains. (See map, Chap.
XVIII.) On the southern flank of these they discharge such a deluge
of rain that the rivers in the rainy season rise twelve feet in as many
hours. Numerous landslips, some of them extending three or four
thousand feet along the face of the mountains, composed of granite,
gneiss, and slate, descend into the beds of streams, and dam them up
for a time, causing temporary lakes, which soon burst their barriers.
"Day and night," says Dr. Hooker, "we heard the crashing of falling
trees, and the sound of boulders thrown violently against each other in
the beds of torrents. By such wear and tear rocky fragments swept
down from the hills are in part converted into sand and fine mud; and
the turbid Ganges, during its annual inundation, derives more of its
sediment from this source than from the waste of the fine clay of the
alluvial plains below.<a name="FNanchor_265" id="FNanchor_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<p>On the verge of the tropics a greater quantity of rain falls annually
than at the equator. Yet parts even of the tropical latitudes are entirely
destitute of rain: Peru, for example, which owes its vegetation
solely to rivers and nightly dews. In that country easterly winds prevail,
blowing from the Pacific, and these being intercepted by the Andes,
and cooled as they rise, are made to part with all their moisture before
reaching the low region to the leeward. The desert zone of North
Africa, between lat. 15&deg; and 30&deg; N., is another instance of a rainless
region. Five or six consecutive years may pass in Upper Egypt, Nubia,
and Dongola, or in the Desert of Sahara, without rain.</p>

<p>From the facts above mentioned, the reader will infer that in the
course of successive geological periods there will be great variations in
the quantity of rain falling in one and the same region. At one time
there may be none whatever during the whole year; at another a fall
of 100 or 500 inches; and these two last averages may occur on the
two opposite flanks of a mountain-chain, not more than 20 miles wide.
While, therefore, the valleys in one district are widened and deepened
annually, they may remain stationary in another, the superficial soil
being protected from waste by a dense covering of vegetation. This
diversity depends on many geographical circumstances, but principally
on the height of the land above the sea, the direction of the prevailing
winds, and the relative position, at the time being, of the plains, hills,
and the ocean, conditions all of which are liable in the course of ages to
undergo a complete revolution.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
<i>Recent rain-prints.</i>&mdash;When examining, in 1842, the extensive mud-flats
of Nova Scotia, which are exposed at low tide on the borders of
the Bay of Fundy, I observed not only the foot-prints of birds which
had recently passed over the mud, but also very distinct impressions of
rain-drops. A peculiar combination of circumstances renders these
mud-flats admirably fitted to receive and retain any markings which
may happen to be made on their surface. The sediment with which
the waters are charged is extremely fine, being derived from the destruction
of cliffs of red sandstone and shale, and as the tides rise fifty feet
and upwards, large areas are laid dry for nearly a fortnight between the
spring and neap tides. In this interval the mud is baked in summer
by a hot sun, so that it solidifies and becomes traversed by cracks,
caused by shrinkage. Portions of the hardened mud between these
cracks may then be taken up and removed without injury. On examining
the edges of each slab, we observe numerous layers, formed by
successive tides, each layer being usually very thin, sometimes only
one-tenth of an inch thick. When a shower of rain falls, the highest
portion of the mud-covered flat is usually too hard to receive any impressions;
while that recently uncovered by the tide near the water's
edge is too soft. Between these areas a zone occurs, almost as smooth
and even as a looking-glass, on which every drop forms a cavity of circular
or oval form, and, if the shower be transient, these pits retain
their shape permanently, being dried by the sun, and being then too
firm to be effaced by the action of the succeeding tide, which deposits
upon them a new layer of mud. Hence we often find, in splitting open
a slab an inch or more thick, on the upper surface of which the marks
of recent rain occur, that an inferior layer, deposited during some previous
rise of the tide, exhibits on its under side perfect casts of rain-prints,
which stand out in relief, the moulds of the same being seen on
the layer below. But in some cases, especially in the more sandy
layers, the markings have been somewhat blunted by the tide, and by
several rain-prints having been joined into one by a repetition of drops
falling on the same spot; in which case the casts present a very irregular
and blistered appearance.</p>

<p>The finest examples which I have seen of these rain-prints were sent
to me by Dr. Webster, from Kentville, on the borders of the Bay of
Mines, in Nova Scotia. They were made by a heavy shower which
fell on the 21st of July, 1849, when the rise and fall of the tides were
at their maximum. The impressions (see <a href="#f13">fig. 13</a>) consist of cup-shaped
or hemispherical cavities, the average size of which is from one-eighth
to one-tenth of an inch across, but the largest are fully half an inch in
diameter, and one-tenth of an inch deep. The depth is chiefly below
the general surface or plane of stratification, but the walls of the cavity
consist partly of a prominent rim of sandy mud, formed of the matter
which has been forcibly expelled from the pit. All the cavities having
an oval form are deeper at one end, where they have also a higher rim,
and all the deep ends have the same direction, showing towards which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
quarter the wind was blowing. Two or more drops are sometimes seen
to have interfered with each other; in which case it is usually possible
to determine which drop fell last, its rim being unbroken.</p>

The arrow represents the direction of the shower.</p></div>

<p>On some of the specimens the winding tubular tracks of worms are
seen, which have been bored just beneath the surface (see <a href="#f13">fig. 13</a>, <i>left
side</i>). They occasionally pass under the middle of a rain-mark, having
been formed subsequently. Sometimes the worms have dived beneath
the surface, and then reappeared. All these appearances, both of rain-prints
and worm-tracks, are of great geological interest, as their exact
counterparts are seen in rocks of various ages, even in formations of
very high antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_266" id="FNanchor_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> Small cavities, often corresponding in size to
those produced by rain, are also caused by air-bubbles rising up through
sand or mud; but these differ in character from rain-prints, being usually
deeper than they are wide, and having their sides steeper. These,
indeed, are occasionally vertical, or overarching, the opening at the
top being narrower than the pit below. In their mode, also, of mutual
interference they are unlike rain-prints.<a name="FNanchor_267" id="FNanchor_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<p>In consequence of the effects of mountains in cooling currents of moist
air, and causing the condensation of aqueous vapor in the manner above
described, it follows that in every country, as a general rule, the more
elevated regions become perpetual reservoirs of water, which descends
and irrigates the lower valleys and plains. The largest quantity of
water is first carried to the highest region, and then made to descend
by steep declivities towards the sea; so that it acquires superior velocity,
and removes more soil, than it would do if the rain had been distributed
over the plains and mountains equally in proportion to their relative
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
areas. The water is also made by these means to pass over the greatest
distances before it can regain the sea.</p>

<p>It has already been observed that in higher latitudes, where the atmosphere
being colder is capable of holding less water in suspension,
a diminished fall of rain takes place. Thus at St. Petersburg, the
amount is only 16 inches, and at Uleaborg in the Gulf of Bothnia (N.
lat. 65&deg;), only 13&frac12; inches, or less than half the average of England, and
even this small quantity descends more slowly in the temperate zone,
and is spread more equally over the year than in tropical climates. But
in reference to geological changes, frost in the colder latitude acts as a
compensating power in the disintegration of rocks, and the transportation
of stones to lower levels.</p>

<p>Water when converted into ice augments in bulk more than one-twentieth
of its volume, and owing to this property it widens the minute
crevices (or <i>joints</i>) of rocks into which it penetrates. Ice also in various
ways, as will be shown in the next chapter, gives buoyancy to mud and
sand, even to huge blocks of stone, enabling rivers of moderate size and
velocity to carry them to a great distance.</p>

<p>The mechanical force exerted by running water in undermining cliffs,
and rounding off the angles of hard rock, is mainly due to the intermixture
of foreign ingredients. Sand and pebbles, when hurried along by
the violence of the stream, are thrown against every obstacle lying in
their way, and thus a power of attrition is acquired, capable of wearing
through the hardest siliceous stones, on which water alone could make
no impression.</p>

<p><i>Newly formed valleys.</i>&mdash;When travelling in Georgia and Alabama, in
1846, I saw in both those States the commencement of hundreds of
valleys in places where the native forest had recently been removed.
One of these newly formed gulleys or ravines is represented in the annexed
woodcut (<a href="#f14">fig. 14</a>), from a drawing which I made on the spot.
It occurs three miles and a half due west of Milledgeville, the capital
of Georgia, and is situated on the farm of Pomona, on the direct road
to Macon.<a name="FNanchor_268" id="FNanchor_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>Twenty years ago, before the land was cleared, it had no existence;
but when the trees of the forest were cut down, cracks three feet deep
were caused by the sun's heat in the clay; and, during the rains, a sudden
rush of water through the principal crack deepened it at its lower
extremity, from whence the excavating power worked backwards, till,
in the course of twenty years, a chasm, measuring no less than 55 feet
in depth, 300 yards in length, and varying in width from 20 to 180
feet, was the result. The high road has been several times turned to
avoid this cavity, the enlargement of which is still proceeding, and the
old line of road may be seen to have held its course directly over what
is now the wildest part of the ravine. In the perpendicular walls of this
great chasm appear beds of clay and sand, red, white, yellow, and
green, produced by the decomposition in situ of hornblendic gneiss, with
layers and veins of quartz, which remain entire, to prove that the whole
mass was once solid and crystalline.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 14.</span><a name="f14" id="f14"></a><img src="images/f14.jpg" width="550" height="670" alt="Ravine on the farm of Pomona." title="" />

<p class="center2">Ravine on the farm of Pomona, near Milledgeville, Georgia, as it appeared January, 1846.
Excavated in twenty years, 55 feet deep, and 180 feet broad.</p></div>

<p>I infer, from the rapidity of the denudation which only began here
after the removal of the native wood, that this spot, elevated about
600 feet above the sea, has been always covered with a dense forest,
from the remote time when it first emerged from the sea. The termination
of the cavity on the right hand in the foreground is the head
or upper end of the ravine, and in almost every case, such gulleys are
lengthened by the streams cutting their way backwards. The depth
at the upper end is often, as in this case, considerable, and there is
usually at this point, during floods, a small cascade.</p>

<p><i>Sinuosities of rivers.</i>&mdash;In proportion as such valleys are widened,
sinuosities are caused by the deflection of the stream first to one side
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
and then to the other. The unequal hardness of the materials through
which the channel is eroded tends partly to give new directions to the
lateral force of excavation. When by these, or by accidental shiftings
of the alluvial matter in the channel, the current is made to cross its
general line of descent, it eats out a curve in the opposite bank, or in
the side of the hills bounding the valley, from which curve it is turned
back again at an equal angle, so that it recrosses the line of descent,
and gradually hollows out another curve lower down in the opposite
bank, till the whole sides of the valley, or river bed, present a succession
of salient and retiring angles. Among the causes of deviation
from a straight course, by which torrents and rivers tend in mountainous
regions to widen the valleys through which they flow, may be mentioned
the confluence of lateral torrents, swollen irregularly at different
seasons by partial storms, and discharging at different times unequal
quantities of sand, mud, and pebbles, into the main channel.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 15.</span><a name="f15" id="f15"></a><img src="images/f15.png" width="400" height="121"
alt="Tortuous flexures of a river." title="" />
</div>

<p>When the tortuous flexures of a river are extremely great, as often
happens in alluvial plains, the aberration from the direct line of descent
may be restored by the river cutting through the isthmus which separates
two neighboring curves. Thus in the annexed diagram, the
extreme sinuosity of the river has caused it to return for a brief space
in a contrary direction to its main course, so that a peninsula is formed,
and the isthmus (at <i>a</i>) is consumed on both sides by currents flowing in
opposite directions. In this case an island is soon formed,&mdash;on either
side of which a portion of the stream usually remains.</p>

<p><i>Transporting power of water.</i>&mdash;In regard to the transporting power
of water, we may often be surprised at the facility with which
streams of a small size, and descending a slight declivity, bear along
coarse sand and gravel; for we usually estimate the weight of rocks
in air, and do not reflect on their comparative buoyancy when submerged
in a denser fluid. The specific gravity of many rocks is not
more than twice that of water, and very rarely more than thrice, so
that almost all the fragments propelled by a stream have lost a third,
and many of them a half, of what we usually term their weight.</p>

<p>It has been proved by experiment, in contradiction to the theories
of the earlier writers on hydrostatics, to be a universal law, regulating
the motion of running water, that the velocity at the bottom of the
stream is everywhere less than in any part above it, and is greatest at
the surface. Also that the superficial particles in the middle of the
stream move swifter than those at the sides. This retardation of the
lowest and lateral currents is produced by friction; and when the
velocity is sufficiently great, the soil composing the sides and bottom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
gives way. A velocity of three inches per second at the bottom is
ascertained to be sufficient to tear up fine clay,&mdash;six inches per second,
fine sand,&mdash;twelve inches per second, fine gravel,&mdash;and three feet per
second, stones of the size of an egg.<a name="FNanchor_269" id="FNanchor_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<p>When this mechanical power of running water is considered, we are
prepared for the transportation before alluded to of large quantities of
gravel, sand, and mud, by torrents which descend from mountainous
regions. But a question naturally arises, How the more tranquil rivers
of the valleys and plains, flowing on comparatively level ground, can
remove the prodigious burden which is discharged into them by their
numerous tributaries, and by what means they are enabled to convey
the whole mass to the sea? If they had not this removing power,
their channels would be annually choked up, and the valleys of the
lower country, and plains at the base of mountain-chains, would be
continually strewed over with fragments of rock and sterile sand. But
this evil is prevented by a general law regulating the conduct of running
water,&mdash;that two equal streams do not, when united, occupy a
bed of double surface. Nay, the width of the principal river, after the
junction of a tributary, sometimes remains the same as before, or is
even lessened. The cause of this apparent paradox was long ago
explained by the Italian writers, who had studied the confluence of the
Po and its feeders in the plains of Lombardy.</p>

<p>The addition of a smaller river augments the velocity of the main
stream, often in the same proportion as it does the quantity of water.
Thus the Venetian branch of the Po swallowed up the Ferranese
branch and that of Panaro without any enlargement of its own dimensions.
The cause of the greater velocity is, first, that after the union
of two rivers the water, in place of the friction of four shores, has
only that of two to surmount; 2dly, because the main body of the
stream being farther distant from the banks, flows on with less interruption;
and lastly, because a greater quantity of water moving more
swiftly, digs deeper into the river's bed. By this beautiful adjustment,
the water which drains the interior country is made continually to
occupy less room as it approaches the sea; and thus the most valuable
part of our continents, the rich deltas and great alluvial plains, are prevented
from being constantly under water.</p>

<p><i>River floods in Scotland</i>, 1829.&mdash;Many remarkable illustrations of
the power of running water in moving stones and heavy materials were
afforded by the storm and floods which occurred on the 3d and 4th
of August, 1829, in Aberdeenshire and other counties in Scotland.
The elements during this storm assumed all the characters which mark
the tropical hurricanes; the wind blowing in sudden gusts and whirlwinds,
the lightning and thunder being such as is rarely witnessed in
our climate, and heavy rain falling without intermission. The floods
extended almost simultaneously, and with equal violence over that part
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
of the northeast of Scotland which would be cut off by two lines
drawn from the head of Lochrannoch, one towards Inverness and the
other to Stonehaven. The united line of the different rivers which
were flooded, could not be less than from five to six hundred miles in
length; and the whole of their courses were marked by the destruction
of bridges, roads, crops, and buildings. Sir T. D. Lauder has
recorded the destruction of thirty-eight bridges, and the entire obliteration
of a great number of farms and hamlets. On the Nairn, a fragment
of sandstone, fourteen feet long by three feet wide and one foot
thick, was carried above 200 yards down the river. Some new ravines
were formed on the sides of mountains where no streams had previously
flowed, and ancient river-channels, which had never been filled from
time immemorial, gave passage to a copious flood.<a name="FNanchor_270" id="FNanchor_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>The bridge over the Dee at Ballater consisted of five arches, having
upon the whole a water-way of 260 feet. The bed of the river, on which
the piers rested, was composed of rolled pieces of granite and gneiss.
The bridge was built of granite, and had stood uninjured for twenty
years; but the different parts were swept away in succession by the
flood, and the whole mass of masonry disappeared in the bed of the
river. "The river Don," observes Mr. Farquharson, in his account of
the inundations, "has upon my own premises forced a mass of four or
five hundred tons of stones, many of them two or three hundred pounds'
weight, up an inclined plane, rising six feet in eight or ten yards, and
left them in a rectangular heap, about three feet deep on a flat ground:&mdash;the
heap ends abruptly at its lower extremity."<a name="FNanchor_271" id="FNanchor_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p>The power even of a small rivulet, when swollen by rain, in removing
heavy bodies, was exemplified in August, 1827, in the College, a
small stream which flows at a slight declivity from the eastern watershed
of the Cheviot Hills. Several thousand tons' weight of gravel and
sand were transported to the plain of the Till, and a bridge, then in
progress of building, was carried away, some of the arch-stones of
which, weighing from half to three quarters of a ton each, were propelled
two miles down the rivulet. On the same occasion, the current
tore away from the abutment of a mill-dam a large block of greenstone-porphyry,
weighing nearly two tons, and transported it to the distance
of a quarter of a mile. Instances are related as occurring repeatedly,
in which from one to three thousand tons of gravel are, in like manner,
removed by this streamlet to still greater distances in one day.<a name="FNanchor_272" id="FNanchor_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

<p><i>Floods caused by landslips</i>, 1826.&mdash;The power which running water
may exert in the lapse of ages, in widening and deepening a valley,
does not so much depend on the volume and velocity of the stream
usually flowing in it, as on the number and magnitude of the obstructions
which have, at different periods, opposed its free passage. If a
torrent, however small, be effectually dammed up, the size of the valley
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
above the barrier, and its declivity below, and not the dimensions of
the torrent, will determine the violence of the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle. The most universal
source of local deluges, are landslips, slides, or avalanches, as
they are sometimes called, when great masses of rock and soil, or sometimes
ice and snow, are precipitated into the bed of a river, the boundary
cliffs of which have been thrown down by the shock of an earthquake,
or undermined by springs or other causes. Volumes might be
filled with the enumeration of instances on record of these terrific catastrophes;
I shall therefore select a few examples of recent occurrence,
the facts of which are well authenticated.</p>

<p>Two dry seasons in the White Mountains, in New Hampshire (United
States), were followed by heavy rains on the 28th August, 1826, when
from the steep and lofty declivities which rise abruptly on both sides of
the river Saco, innumerable rocks and stones, many of sufficient size to
fill a common apartment, were detached, and in their descent swept
down before them, in one promiscuous and frightful ruin, forests, shrubs,
and the earth which sustained them. Although there are numerous
indications on the steep sides of these hills of former slides of the same
kind, yet no tradition had been handed down of any similar catastrophe
within the memory of man, and the growth of the forest on the very
spots now devastated, clearly showed that for a long interval nothing
similar had occurred. One of these moving masses was afterwards
found to have slid three miles, with an average breadth of a quarter of
a mile. The natural excavations commenced generally in a trench a few
yards in depth and a few rods in width, and descended the mountains,
widening and deepening till they became vast chasms. At the base of
these hollow ravines was seen a confused mass of ruins, consisting of
transported earth, gravel, rocks, and trees. Forests of spruce-fir and
hemlock, a kind of fir somewhat resembling our yew in foliage, were
prostrated with as much ease as if they had been fields of grain; for,
where they disputed the ground, the torrent of mud and rock accumulated
behind, till it gathered sufficient force to burst the temporary barrier.</p>

<p>The valleys of the Amonoosuck and Saco presented, for many miles,
an uninterrupted scene of desolation; all the bridges being carried away,
as well as those over their tributary streams. In some places, the road
was excavated to the depth of from fifteen to twenty feet; in others, it
was covered with earth, rocks, and trees, to as great a height. The
water flowed for many weeks after the flood, as densely charged with
earth as it could be without being changed into mud, and marks were
seen in various localities of its having risen on either side of the valley to
more than twenty-five feet above its ordinary level. Many sheep and
cattle were swept away, and the Willey family, nine in number, who in
alarm had deserted their house, were destroyed on the banks of the
Saco; seven of their mangled bodies were afterwards found near the
river, buried beneath drift-wood and mountain ruins.<a name="FNanchor_273" id="FNanchor_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> Eleven years
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
after the event, the deep channels worn by the avalanches of mud and
stone, and the immense heaps of boulders and blocks of granite in the
river channel, still formed, says Professor Hubbard, a picturesque feature
in the scenery.<a name="FNanchor_274" id="FNanchor_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a></p>

<p>When I visited the country in 1845, eight years after Professor
Hubbard, I found the signs of devastation still very striking; I also particularly
remarked that although the surface of the bare granitic rocks
had been smoothed by the passage over them of so much mud and stone,
there were no continuous parallel and rectilinear furrows, nor any of the
fine scratches or stri&aelig; which characterize <i>glacial</i> action. The absence
of these is nowhere more clearly exemplified than in the bare rocks over
which passed the great "Willey slide" of 1826.<a name="FNanchor_275" id="FNanchor_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<p>But the catastrophes in the White Mountains are insignificant, when
compared to those which are occasioned by earthquakes, when the
boundary hills, for miles in length, are thrown down into the hollow of
a valley. I shall have opportunities of alluding to inundations of this
kind, when treating expressly of earthquakes, and shall content myself
at present with selecting an example of a flood due to a different cause.</p>

<p><i>Flood in the valley of Bagnes</i>, 1818.&mdash;The valley of Bagnes is one of
the largest of the lateral embranchments of the main valley of the Rhone,
above the Lake of Geneva. Its upper portion was, in 1818, converted
into a lake by the damming up of a narrow pass, by avalanches of snow
and ice, precipitated from an elevated glacier into the bed of the river
Dranse. In the winter season, during continued frost, scarcely any
water flows in the bed of this river to preserve an open channel, so that
the ice barrier remained entire until the melting of the snows in spring,
when a lake was formed above, about half a league in length, which
finally attained in some parts a depth of about two hundred feet, and a
width of about seven hundred feet. To prevent or lessen the mischief
apprehended from the sudden bursting of the barrier, an artificial gallery,
seven hundred feet in length, was cut through the ice, before the waters
had risen to a great height. When at length they accumulated and
flowed through this tunnel, they dissolved the ice, and thus deepened
their channel, until nearly half of the whole contents of the lake were
slowly drained off. But at length, on the approach of the hot season,
the central portion of the remaining mass of ice gave way with a tremendous
crash, and the residue of the lake was emptied in half an hour.
In the course of its descent, the waters encountered several narrow
gorges, and at each of these they rose to a great height, and then burst
with new violence into the next basin, sweeping along rocks, forests,
houses, bridges, and cultivated land. For the greater part of its course
the flood resembled a moving mass of rock and mud, rather than of
water. Some fragments of granitic rocks, of enormous magnitude, and
which from their dimensions, might be compared without exaggeration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
to houses, were torn out of a more ancient alluvion, and borne down
for a quarter of a mile. One of the fragments moved was sixty paces
in circumference.<a name="FNanchor_276" id="FNanchor_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> The velocity of the water, in the first part of its
course, was thirty-three feet per second, which diminished to six feet
before it reached the Lake of Geneva, where it arrived in six hours and
a half, the distance being forty-five miles.<a name="FNanchor_277" id="FNanchor_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<p>This flood left behind it, on the plains of Martigny, thousands of trees
torn up by the roots, together with the ruins of buildings. Some of the
houses in that town were filled with mud up to the second story. After
expanding in the plain of Martigny, it entered the Rhone, and did no
farther damage; but some bodies of men, who had been drowned above
Martigny, were afterwards found, at the distance of about thirty miles,
floating on the farther side of the Lake of Geneva, near Vevay.</p>

<p>The waters, on escaping from the temporary lake, intermixed with
mud and rock, swept along, for the first four miles, at the rate of above
twenty miles an hour; and M. Escher, the engineer, calculated that the
flood furnished 300,000 cubic feet of water every second&mdash;an efflux
which is five times greater than that of the Rhine below Basle. Now,
if part of the lake had not been gradually drained off, the flood would
have been nearly double, approaching in volume to some of the largest
rivers in Europe. It is evident, therefore, that when we are speculating
on the excavating force which a river may have exerted in any particular
valley, the most important question is, not the volume of the existing
stream, nor the present levels of its channel, nor even the nature of the
rocks, but the probability of a succession of floods at some period since
the time when the valley may have been first elevated above the sea.</p>

<p>For several months after the d&eacute;b&acirc;cle of 1818, the Dranse, having no
settled channel, shifted its position continually from one side to the
other of the valley, carrying away newly-erected bridges, undermining
houses, and continuing to be charged with as large a quantity of earthy
matter as the fluid could hold in suspension. I visited this valley four
months after the flood, and was witness to the sweeping away of a
bridge, and the undermining of part of a house. The greater part of
the ice-barrier was then standing, presenting vertical cliffs 150 feet high,
like ravines in the lava-currents of Etna or Auvergne, where they are
intersected by rivers.</p>

<p>Inundations, precisely similar, are recorded to have occurred at former
periods in this district, and from the same cause. In 1595, for example,
a lake burst, and the waters, descending with irresistible fury,
destroyed the town of Martigny, where from sixty to eighty persons
perished. In a similar flood, fifty years before, 140 persons were
drowned.</p>

<p><i>Flood at Tivoli</i>, 1826.&mdash;I shall conclude with one more example
derived from a land of classic recollections, the ancient Tibur, and which,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
like all the other inundations above alluded to, occurred within the
present century. The younger Pliny, it will be remembered, describes
a flood on the Anio, which destroyed woods, rocks, and houses, with
the most sumptuous villas and works of arts.<a name="FNanchor_278" id="FNanchor_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> For four or five centuries
consecutively, this "headlong stream," as Horace truly called it,
has often remained within its bounds, and then, after so long an interval
of rest, has at different periods inundated its banks again, and widened
its channel. The last of these catastrophes happened 15th Nov. 1826,
after heavy rains, such as produced the floods before alluded to in Scotland.
The waters appear also to have been impeded by an artificial
dike, by which they were separated into two parts, a short distance
above Tivoli. They broke through this dike; and leaving the left trench
dry, precipitated themselves, with their whole weight, on the right side.
Here they undermined, in the course of a few hours, a high cliff, and
widened the river's channel about fifteen paces. On this height stood
the church of St. Lucia, and about thirty-six houses of the town of
Tivoli, which were all carried away, presenting as they sank into the
roaring flood, a terrific scene of destruction to the spectators on the opposite
bank. As the foundations were gradually removed, each building,
some of them edifices of considerable height, was first traversed
with numerous rents, which soon widened into large fissures, until at
length the roofs fell in with a crash, and then the walls sunk into the
river, and were hurled down the cataract below.<a name="FNanchor_279" id="FNanchor_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<p>The destroying agency of the flood came within two hundred yards
of the precipice on which the beautiful temple of Vesta stands; but
fortunately this precious relic of antiquity was spared, while the wreck
of modern structures was hurled down the abyss. Vesta, it will be
remembered, in the heathen mythology, personified the stability of the
earth; and when the Samian astronomer, Aristarchus, first taught that
the earth revolved on its axis, and round the sun, he was publicly accused
of impiety, "for removing the everlasting Vesta from her place."
Playfair observed, that when Hutton ascribed instability to the earth's
surface, and represented the continents which we inhabit as the theatre
of incessant change and movement, his antagonists, who regarded them
as unalterable, assailed him in a similar manner with accusations founded
on religious prejudices.<a name="FNanchor_280" id="FNanchor_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> We might appeal to the excavating power of
the Anio as corroborative of one of the most controverted parts of the
Huttonian theory; and if the days of omens had not gone by, the geologists
who now worship Vesta might regard the late catastrophe as
portentous. We may, at least, recommend the modern votaries of the
goddess to lose no time in making a pilgrimage to her shrine, for the
next flood may not respect the temple.</p>

<p><i>Excavation of rocks by running water.</i>&mdash;The rapidity with which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
even the smallest streams hollow out deep channels in soft and destructible
soils is remarkably exemplified in volcanic countries, where the sand
and half-consolidated tuffs opposed but a slight resistance to the torrents
which descend the mountain-side. After the heavy rains which followed
the eruption of Vesuvius in 1824, the water flowing from the Atrio del
Cavallo cut, in three days, a new chasm through strata of tuff and
ejected volcanic matter, to the depth of twenty-five feet. I found the
old mule-road, in 1828, intersected by this new ravine.</p>

<p>The gradual erosion of deep chasms through some of the hardest rocks,
by the constant passage of running water, charged with foreign matter,
is another phenomenon of which striking examples may be adduced.
Illustrations of this excavating power are presented by many valleys in
central France where the channels of rivers have been barred up by
solid currents of lava, through which the streams have re-excavated a
passage, to the depth of from twenty to seventy feet and upwards, and
often of great width. In these cases there are decisive proofs that
neither the sea, nor any denuding wave or extraordinary body of water,
has passed over the spot since the melted lava was consolidated. Every
hypothesis of the intervention of sudden and violent agency is entirely
excluded, because the cones of <i>loose</i> scori&aelig;, out of which the lavas
flowed, are oftentimes at no great elevation above the rivers, and have
remained undisturbed during the whole period which has been sufficient
for the hollowing out of such enormous ravines.</p>

<p><i>Recent excavation by the Simeto.</i>&mdash;But I shall at present confine myself
to examples derived from events which have happened since the
time of history.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><p class="center2">Fig. 16.</p><a name="f16" id="f16"></a><img src="images/f16.png" width="550" height="211" alt="Recent excavation of lava." title="" />

<p class="center2">Recent excavation of lava at the foot of Etna by the river Simeto.</p></div>

<p>At the western base of Etna, a current of lava (<span class="smcap">A A</span>, <a href="#f16">fig. 16</a>), descending
from near the summit of the great volcano, has flowed to the
distance of five or six miles, and then reached the alluvial plain of the
Simeto, the largest of the Sicilian rivers, which skirts the base of Etna,
and falls into the sea a few miles south of Catania. The lava entered
the river about three miles above the town of Aderno, and not only occupied
its channel for some distance, but, crossing to the opposite side
of the valley, accumulated there in a rocky mass. Gemmellaro gives
the year 1603 as the date of the eruption.<a name="FNanchor_281" id="FNanchor_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> The appearance of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
current clearly proves, that it is one of the most modern of those of
Etna; for it has not been covered or crossed by subsequent streams or
ejections, and the olives which had been planted on its surface were all
of small size, when I examined the spot in 1828, yet they were older
than the natural wood on the same lava. In the course, therefore, of
about two centuries, the Simeto has eroded a passage from fifty to several
hundred feet wide, and in some parts from forty to fifty feet deep.</p>

<p>The portion of lava cut through is in no part porous or scoriaceous,
but consists of a compact homogeneous mass of hard blue rock, somewhat
inferior in weight to ordinary basalt, and containing crystals of
olivine and glassy felspar. The general declivity of this part of the bed
of the Simeto is not considerable; but, in consequence of the unequal
waste of the lava, two water-falls occur at Passo Manzanelli, each about
six feet in height. Here the chasm (<span class="smcap">B</span>, <a href="#f16">fig. 16</a>) is about forty feet deep,
and only fifty broad.</p>

<p>The sand and pebbles in the river-bed consist chiefly of a brown
quartzose sandstone, derived from the upper country; but the materials
of the volcanic rock itself must have greatly assisted the attrition. This
river, like the Caltabiano on the eastern side of Etna, has not yet cut
down to the ancient bed of which it was dispossessed, and of which
the probable position is indicated in the annexed diagram (<span class="smcap">C</span>, <a href="#f16">fig. 16</a>).</p>

<p>On entering the narrow ravine where the water foams down the two
cataracts, we are entirely shut out from all view of the surrounding
country; and a geologist who is accustomed to associate the characteristic
features of the landscape with the relative age of certain rocks, can
scarcely dissuade himself from the belief that he is contemplating a
scene in some rocky gorge of a primary district. The external forms of
the hard blue lava are as massive as any of the most ancient trap-rocks
of Scotland. The solid surface is in some parts smoothed and almost
polished by attrition, and covered in others with a white lichen, which
imparts to it an air of extreme antiquity, so as greatly to heighten the
delusion. But the moment we reascend the cliff the spell is broken;
for we scarcely recede a few paces, before the ravine and river disappear,
and we stand on the black and rugged surface of a vast current of
lava, which seems unbroken, and which we can trace up nearly to the
distant summit of that majestic cone which Pindar called "the pillar of
heaven," and which still continues to send forth a fleecy wreath of vapor,
reminding us that its fires are not extinct, and that it may again
give out a rocky stream, wherein other scenes like that now described
may present themselves to future observers.</p>

<p><i>Falls of Niagara.</i>&mdash;The falls of Niagara afford a magnificent example
of the progressive excavation of a deep valley in solid rock. That
river flows over a flat table-land, in a depression of which Lake Erie
is situated. Where it issues from the lake, it is nearly a mile in width,
and 330 feet above Lake Ontario, which is about 30 miles distant. For
the first fifteen miles below Lake Erie the surrounding country, comprising
Upper Canada on the west, and the state of New York on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
east, is almost on a level with its banks, and nowhere more than thirty
or forty feet above them.<a name="FNanchor_282" id="FNanchor_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> (See <a href="#f17">fig. 17</a>.) The river being occasionally
interspersed with low wooded islands, and having sometimes a width of
three miles, glides along at first with a clear, smooth, and tranquil current,
falling only fifteen feet in as many miles, and in this part of its
course resembling an arm of Lake Erie. But its character is afterwards
entirely changed, on approaching the Rapids, where it begins to rush
and foam over a rocky and uneven limestone bottom, for the space of
nearly a mile, till at length it is thrown down perpendicularly 165 feet
at the Falls. Here the river is divided into two sheets of water by an
island, the largest cataract being more than a third of a mile broad, the
smaller one having a breadth of six hundred feet. When the water has
precipitated itself into an unfathomable pool, it rushes with great velocity
down the sloping bottom of a narrow chasm, for a distance of
seven miles. This ravine varies from 200 to 400 yards in width from
cliff to cliff; contrasting, therefore, strongly in its breadth with that of
the river above. Its depth is from 200 to 300 feet, and it intersects
for about seven miles the table-land before described, which terminates
suddenly at Queenstown in an escarpment or long line of inland cliff
facing northwards, towards Lake Ontario. The Niagara, on reaching
the escarpment and issuing from the gorge, enters the flat country,
which is so nearly on a level with Lake Ontario, that there is only a fall
of about four feet in the seven additional miles which intervene between
Queenstown and the shores of that lake.</p>

<p>It has long been the popular belief that the Niagara once flowed in a
shallow valley across the whole platform, from the present site of the
Falls to the escarpment (called the Queenstown heights), where it is
supposed that the cataract was first situated, and that the river has
been slowly eating its way backwards through the rocks for the distance
of seven miles. This hypothesis naturally suggests itself to every
observer, who sees the narrowness of the gorge at its termination, and
throughout its whole course, as far up as the Falls, above which
point the river expands as before stated. The boundary cliffs of the
ravine are usually perpendicular, and in many places undermined on
one side by the impetuous stream. The uppermost rock of the table-land
at the Falls consists of hard limestone (a member of the Silurian
series), about ninety feet thick, beneath which lie soft shales of
equal thickness, continually undermined by the action of the spray,
which rises from the pool into which so large a body of water is projected,
and is driven violently by gusts of wind against the base of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
precipice. In consequence of this action, and that of frost, the shale
disintegrates and crumbles away, and portions of the incumbent rock
overhang 40 feet, and often when unsupported tumble down, so that
the Falls do not remain absolutely stationary at the same spot, even for
half a century. Accounts have come down to us, from the earliest period
of observation, of the frequent destruction of these rocks, and the
sudden descent of huge fragments in 1818 and 1828, are said to have
shaken the adjacent country like an earthquake. The earliest travellers,
Hennepin and Kalm, who in 1678 and 1751 visited the Falls, and
published views of them, attest the fact, that the rocks have been suffering
from dilapidation for more than a century and a half, and that
some slight changes, even in the scenery of the cataract have been
brought about within that time. The idea, therefore, of perpetual and
progressive waste is constantly present to the mind of every beholder;
and as that part of the chasm, which has been the work of the last
hundred and fifty years resembles precisely, in depth, width, and character,
the rest of the gorge which extends seven miles below, it is most
natural to infer, that the entire ravine has been hollowed out in the same
manner, by the recession of the cataract.</p>

<p>It must at least be conceded, that the river supplies an adequate
cause for executing the whole task thus assigned to it, provided we
grant sufficient time for its completion. As this part of the country
was a wilderness till near the end of the last century, we can obtain
no accurate data for estimating the exact rate at which the cataract has
been receding. Mr. Bakewell, son of the eminent geologist of that
name, who visited the Niagara in 1829, made the first attempt to calculate
from the observations of one who had lived forty years at the
Falls, and who had been the first settler there, that the cataract had
during that period gone back about a yard annually. But after the
most careful inquiries which I was able to make, during my visit to
the spot in 1841-2, I came to the conclusion that the average of one
foot a year would be a much more probable conjecture. In that case,
it would have required thirty-five thousand years for the retreat of the
Falls, from the escarpment of Queenstown to their present site. It
seems by no means improbable that such a result would be no exaggeration
of the truth, although we cannot assume that the retrograde
movement has been uniform. An examination of the geological structure
of the district, as laid open in the ravine, shows that at every step
in the process of excavation, the height of the precipice, the hardness
of the materials at its base, and the quantity of fallen matter to be
removed, must have varied. At some points it may have receded much
faster than at present, but in general its progress was probably slower,
because the cataract, when it began to recede, must have had nearly
twice its present height.</p>

<p>From observations made by me in 1841, when I had the advantage
of being accompanied by Mr. Hall, state geologist of New York, and
in 1842, when I re-examined the Niagara district, I obtained
geological<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
evidence of the former existence of an old river-bed, which, I have
no doubt, indicates the original channel through which the waters once
flowed from the Falls to Queenstown, at the height of nearly three
hundred feet above the bottom of the present gorge. The geological
monuments alluded to, consist of patches of sand and gravel, forty feet
thick, containing fluviatile shells of the genera Unio, Cyclas, Melania,
&amp;c., such as now inhabit the waters of the Niagara above the Falls.
The identity of the fossil species with the recent is unquestionable, and
these freshwater deposits occur at the edge of the cliffs bounding the
ravine, so that they prove the former extension of an elevated shallow
valley, four miles below the falls, a distinct prolongation of that now
occupied by the Niagara, in the elevated region intervening between
Lake Erie and the Falls. Whatever theory be framed for the hollowing
out of the ravine further down, or for the three miles which intervene
between the whirlpool and Queenstown, it will always be necessary
to suppose the former existence of a barrier of <i>rock</i>, not of loose and
destructible materials, such as those composing the drift in this district,
somewhere immediately below the whirlpool. By that barrier the
waters were held back for ages, when the fluviatile deposit, 40 feet in
thickness, and 250 feet above the present channel of the river, originated.
If we are led by this evidence to admit that the cataract has
cut back its way for four miles, we can have little hesitation in referring
the excavation of the remaining three miles below to a like agency, the
shape of the chasm being precisely similar.</p>

<p>There have been many speculations respecting the future recession
of the Falls, and the deluge that might be occasioned by the sudden
escape of the waters of Lake Erie, if the ravine should ever be prolonged
16 miles backwards. But a more accurate knowledge of the
geological succession of the rocks, brought to light by the State Survey,
has satisfied every geologist that the Falls would diminish gradually
in height before they travelled back two miles, and in consequence
of a gentle dip of the strata to the south, the massive limestone now at
the top would then be at their base, and would retard, and perhaps put
an effectual stop to, the excavating process.</p>

<p>The power of running water to carry sand, gravel, and fragments
of rock to considerable distances is greatly augmented in those regions
where, during some part of the year, the frost is of sufficient intensity
to convert the water, either at the surface or bottom of rivers, into ice.</p>

<p>This subject may be considered under three different heads:&mdash;first,
the effect of surface-ice and ground-ice in enabling streams to remove
gravel and stones to a distance; secondly, the action of glaciers in the
transport of boulders, and in the polishing and scratching of rocks;
thirdly, the floating off of glaciers charged with solid matter into the
sea, and the drifting of icebergs and coast-ice.</p>

<p><i>River-ice.</i>&mdash;Pebbles and small pieces of rock may be seen entangled
in ice, and floating annually down the Tay in Scotland, as far as the
mouth of that river. Similar observations might doubtless be made
respecting almost all the larger rivers of England and Scotland; but
there seems reason to suspect that the principal transfer from place
to place of pebbles and stones adhering to ice goes on unseen by us
under water. For although the specific gravity of the compound
mass may cause it to sink, it may still be very buoyant, and easily borne
along by a feeble current. The ice, moreover, melts very slowly at the
bottom of running streams in winter, as the water there is often nearly
at the freezing point, as will be seen from what will be said in the
sequel of ground-ice.</p>

<p>As we traverse Europe in the latitudes of Great Britain, we find the
winters more severe, and the rivers more regularly frozen over. M.
Lariviere relates that, being at Memel on the Baltic in 1821, when the
ice of the river Niemen broke up, he saw a mass of ice thirty feet long
which had descended the stream, and had been thrown ashore. In the
middle of it was a triangular piece of granite, about a yard in diameter,
resembling in composition the red granite of Finland.<a name="FNanchor_283" id="FNanchor_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
When rivers in the northern hemisphere flow from south to north,
the ice first breaks up in the higher part of their course, and the flooded
waters, bearing along large icy fragments, often arrive at parts of the
stream which are still firmly frozen over. Great inundations are thus
frequently occasioned by the obstructions thrown in the way of the descending
waters, as in the case of the Mackenzie in North America, and
the Irtish, Obi, Yenesei, Lena, and other rivers of Siberia. (See map,
<a href="#f1">fig. 1</a>, p. 79.) A partial stoppage of this kind lately occurred (Jan. 31,
1840) in the Vistula, about a mile and a half above the city of Dantzic,
where the river, choked up by packed ice, was made to take a new
course over its right bank, so that it hollowed out in a few days a
deep and broad channel, many leagues in length, through a tract of
sand-hills which were from 40 to 60 feet high.</p>

<p>In Canada, where the winter's cold is intense, in a latitude corresponding
to that of central France, several tributaries of the St. Lawrence
begin to thaw in their upper course, while they remain frozen
over lower down, and thus large slabs of ice are set free and thrown
upon the unbroken sheet of ice below. Then begins what is called the
packing of the drifted fragments; that is to say, one slab is made to
slide over another, until a vast pile is built up, and the whole being
frozen together, is urged onwards by the force of the dammed up
waters and drift-ice. Thus propelled, it not only forces along boulders,
but breaks off from cliffs, which border the rivers, huge pieces of
projecting rock. By this means several buttresses of solid masonry,
which, up to the year 1836, supported a wooden bridge on the St.
Maurice, which falls into the St. Lawrence, near the town of Trois
Rivi&egrave;res, lat. 46&deg; 20', were thrown down, and conveyed by the ice
into the main river; and instances have occurred at Montreal of wharfs
and stone-buildings, from 30 to 50 feet square, having been removed in
a similar manner. We learn from Captain Bayfield that anchors laid
down within high-water mark, to secure vessels hauled on shore for the
winter, must be cut out of the ice on the approach of spring, or they
would be carried away. In 1834, the Gulnare's bower-anchor, weighing
half a ton, was transported some yards by the ice, and so firmly
was it fixed, that the force of the moving ice broke a chain-cable suited
for a 10-gun brig, and which had rode the Gulnare during the heaviest
gales in the gulf. Had not this anchor been cut out of the ice, it would
have been earned into deep water and lost.<a name="FNanchor_284" id="FNanchor_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<p class="center2">BOULDERS DRIFTED BY ICE ON SHORES OF THE ST. LAWRENCE<br />
View taken by Lieut. Bowen, from the N. E., in the Spring of 1835, at Richelieu Rapid, lat. 46&deg; N.</p></div>

<p>The scene represented in the annexed plate (pl. 2), from a drawing
by Lieutenant Bowen, R. N., will enable the reader to comprehend the
incessant changes which the transport of boulders produces annually
on the low islands, shores, and bed of the St. Lawrence above Quebec.
The fundamental rocks at Richelieu Rapid, situated in lat. 46&deg; N., are
limestone and slate, which are seen at low-water to be covered with
boulders of granite. These boulders owe their spheroidal form chiefly to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
weathering, or action of frost, which causes the surface to exfoliate in
concentric plates, so that all the more prominent angles are removed.
At the point <i>a</i> is a cavity in the mud or sand of the beach, now filled
with water, which was occupied during the preceding winter (1835) by
the huge erratic <i>b</i>, a mass of granite, 70 tons' weight, found in the
spring following (1836) at a distance of several feet from its former
position. Many small islands are seen on the river, such as <i>c d</i>, which
afford still more striking proofs of the carrying and propelling power of
ice. These islets are never under water, yet every winter ice is thrown
upon them in such abundance, that it <i>packs</i> to the height of 20, and
even 30 feet, bringing with it a continual supply of large stones or
boulders, and carrying away others; the greatest number being deposited,
according to Lieutenant Bowen, on the edge of deep water. On
the island <i>d</i>, on the left of the accompanying view, a lighthouse is represented,
consisting of a square wooden building, which having no other
foundation than the boulders, requires to be taken down every winter,
and rebuilt on the reopening of the river.</p>

<p>These effects of frost, which are so striking on the St. Lawrence
above Quebec, are by no means displayed on a smaller scale below that
city, where the gulf rises and falls with the tide. On the contrary; it
is in the estuary, between the latitudes 47&deg; and 49&deg;, that the greatest
quantity of gravel and boulders of large dimensions are carried down
annually towards the sea. Here the frost is so intense, that a dense
sheet of ice is formed at low water, which, on the rise of the tide, is
lifted up, broken, and thrown in heaps on the extensive shoals which
border the estuary. When the tide recedes, this packed ice is exposed
to a temperature sometimes 30&deg; below zero, which freezes together all
the loose pieces of ice, as well as the granitic and other boulders. The
whole of these are often swept away by a high tide, or when the river
is swollen by the melting of the snow in Spring. One huge block of
granite, 15 feet long by 10 feet both in width and height, and estimated
to contain 1500 cubic feet, was conveyed in this manner to some distance
in the year 1837, its previous position being well known, as up
to that time it had been used by Captain Bayfield as a mark for the
surveying station.</p>

<p><i>Ground-ice.</i>&mdash;When a current of cold air passes over the surface of
a lake or stream it abstracts from it a quantity of heat, and the specific
gravity of the water being thereby increased, the cooled portion sinks.
This circulation may continue until the whole body of fluid has been
cooled down to the temperature of 40&deg; F., after which, if the cold increase,
the vertical movement ceases, the water which is uppermost
expands and floats over the heavier fluid below, and when it has attained
a temperature of 32&deg; Fahr. it sets into a sheet of ice. It should seem
therefore impossible, according to this law of congelation, that ice
should ever form at the bottom of a river; and yet such is the fact, and
many speculations have been hazarded to account for so singular a phenomenon.
M. Arago is of opinion that the mechanical action of a running
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
stream produces a circulation by which the entire body of water is
mixed up together, and cooled alike, and the whole being thus reduced
to the freezing point, ice begins to form at the bottom for two reasons,
first, because there is less motion there, and secondly, because the
water is in contact with solid rock or pebbles which have a cold surface.<a name="FNanchor_285" id="FNanchor_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a>
Whatever explanation we adopt, there is no doubt of the fact,
that in countries where the intensity and duration of the cold is great,
rivers and torrents acquire an increase of carrying power by the formation
of what is called ground-ice. Even in the Thames we learn from
Dr. Plott that pieces of this kind of ice, having gravel frozen on to their
under side, rise up from the bottom in winter, and float on the surface.
In the Siberian rivers, Weitz describes large stones as having been
brought up from the river's bed in the same manner, and made to
float.<a name="FNanchor_286" id="FNanchor_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<p><i>Glaciers.</i>&mdash;In the temperate zone, the snow lies for months in winter
on the summit of every high mountain, while in the arctic regions, a
long summer's day of half a year's duration is insufficient to melt the
snow, even on land just raised above the level of the sea. It is therefore
not surprising, since the atmosphere becomes colder in proportion
as we ascend in it, that there should be heights, even in tropical countries,
where the snow never melts. The lowest limit to which the perpetual
snow extends downwards, from the tops of mountains at the
equator, is an elevation of not less than 16,000 feet above the sea;
while in the Swiss Alps, in lat. 46&deg; N. it reaches as low as 8,500 feet
above the same level, the loftier peaks of the Alpine chain being from
12,000 to 15,000 feet high. The frozen mass augmenting from year to
year would add indefinitely to the altitude of alpine summits, were it
not relieved by its descent through the larger and deeper valleys to
regions far below the general snow-line. To these it slowly finds its
way in the form of rivers of ice, called glaciers, the consolidation of
which is produced by pressure, and by the congelation of water infiltered
into the porous mass, which is always undergoing partial liquefaction,
and receiving in summer occasional showers of rain on its surface.
In a day of hot sunshine, or mild rain, innumerable rills of pure and
sparkling water run in icy channels along the surface of the glaciers,
which in the night shrink, and come to nothing. They are often precipitated
in bold cascades into deep fissures in the ice, and contribute together
with springs to form torrents, which flow in tunnels at the bottom
of the glaciers for many a league, and at length issue at their
extremities, from beneath beautiful caverns or arches. The waters of
these streams are always densely charged with the finest mud, produced
by the grinding of rock and sand under the weight of the moving
mass. (See <a href="#f18">fig. 18</a>.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<p class="center2">Glacier with medial and lateral moraines and with terminal cave</p></div>

<p>The length of the Swiss glaciers is sometimes twenty miles, their
width in the middle portion, where they are broadest, occasionally two
or three miles; their depth or thickness sometimes more than 600 feet.
When they descend steep slopes, and precipices, or are forced through
narrow gorges, the ice is broken up, and assumes the most fantastic and
picturesque forms, with lofty peaks and pinnacles, projecting above the
general level. These snow-white masses are often relieved by a dark
background of pines, as in the valley of Chamouni; and are not only
surrounded with abundance of the wild rhododendron in full flower,
but encroach still lower into the region of cultivation, and trespass on
fields where the tobacco-plant is flourishing by the side of the peasant's
hut.</p>

<p>The cause of glacier motion has of late been a subject of careful
investigation and much keen controversy. Although a question of
physics, rather than of geology, it is too interesting to allow me to pass
it by without some brief mention. De Saussure, whose travels in the
Alps are full of original observations, as well as sound and comprehensive
general views, conceived that the weight of the ice might be sufficient
to urge it down the slope of the valley, if the sliding motion were
aided by the water flowing at the bottom. For this "gravitation
theory" Charpentier, followed by Agassiz, substituted the hypothesis of
dilatation. The most solid ice is always permeable to water, and penetrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
by innumerable fissures and capillary tubes, often extremely
minute. These tubes imbibe the aqueous fluid during the day, which
freezes, it is said, in the cold of the night, and expands while in the act
of congelation. The distension of the whole mass exerts an immense
force, tending to propel the glacier in the direction of least resistance&mdash;"in
other words, down the valley." This theory was opposed by
Mr. Hopkins on mathematical and mechanical grounds, in several able
papers. Among other objections, he pointed out that the friction of
so enormous a body as a glacier on its bed is so great, that the vertical
direction would always be that of least resistance, and if a considerable
distension of the mass should take place, by the action of freezing, it
would tend to increase its thickness, rather than accelerate its downward
progress. He also contended (and his arguments were illustrated
by many ingenious experiments), that a glacier can move along an
extremely slight slope, solely by the influence of gravitation, owing to
the constant dissolution of ice in contact with the rocky bottom, and
the number of separate fragments into which the glacier is divided by
fissures, so that freedom of motion is imparted to its several parts
somewhat resembling that of an imperfect fluid. To this view Professor
James Forbes objected, that gravitation would not supply an adequate
cause for the sliding of solid ice down slopes having an inclination
of no more than four or five degrees, still less would it explain
how the glacier advances where the channel expands and contracts.
The Mer de Glace in Chamouni, for example, after being 2000 yards
wide, passes through a strait only 900 yards in width. Such a gorge,
it is contended, would be choked up by the advance of any solid
mass, even if it be broken up into numerous fragments. The same
acute observer remarked, that water in the fissures and pores of glaciers
cannot, and does not part with its latent heat, so as to freeze
every night to a great depth, or far in the interior of the mass. Had
the dilatation theory been true, the chief motion of the glacier would
have occurred about sunset, when the freezing of the water must be
greatest, and it had, in fact, been at first assumed by those who favored
that hypothesis, that the mass moved faster at the sides, where the
melting of ice was promoted by the sun's heat, reflected from boundary
precipices.</p>

<p>Agassiz appears to have been the first to commence, in 1841, aided
by a skilful engineer, M. Escher de la Linth, a series of exact measurements
to ascertain the laws of glacier motion, and he soon discovered,
contrary to his preconceived notions, that the stream of ice moved more
slowly at the sides than at the centre, and faster in the middle region
of the glacier than at its extremity.<a name="FNanchor_287" id="FNanchor_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> Professor James Forbes, who
had joined Mr. Agassiz during his earlier investigations in the Alps,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
undertook himself an independent series of experiments, which he followed
up with great perseverance, to determine the laws of glacier
motion. These he found to agree very closely with the laws governing
the course of rivers, their progress being greater in the centre than
at the sides, and more rapid at the surface than at the bottom. This
fact was verified by carefully fixing a great number of marks in the
ice, arranged in a straight line, which gradually assumed a beautiful
curve, the middle part pointing down the glacier, and showing a velocity
there, double or treble that of the lateral parts.<a name="FNanchor_288" id="FNanchor_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> He ascertained
that the rate of advance by night was nearly the same as by day, and
that even the hourly march of the icy stream could be detected, although
the progress might not amount to more than six or seven inches
in twelve hours. By the incessant though invisible advance of the
marks placed on the ice, "time," says Mr. Forbes, "was marked out
as by a shadow on a dial, and the unequivocal evidence which I obtained,
that even while walking on a glacier we are, day by day, and
hour by hour, imperceptibly carried on by the resistless flow of the icy
stream, filled me with admiration." (Travels in the Alps, p. 133.) In
order to explain this remarkable regularity of motion, and its obedience
to laws so strictly analogous to those of fluids, the same writer proposed
the theory that the ice, instead of being solid and compact, is a
viscous or plastic body, capable of yielding to great pressure, and the
more so in proportion as its temperature is higher, and as it approaches
more nearly to the melting point. He endeavors to show that this
hypothesis will account for many complicated phenomena, especially
for a ribboned or veined structure which is everywhere observable
in the ice, and might be produced by lines of discontinuity, arising
from the different rates at which the various portions of the semi-rigid
glacier advance and pass each other. Many examples are adduced to
prove that a glacier can model itself to the form of the ground over
which it is forced, exactly as would happen if it possessed a certain
ductility, and this power of yielding under intense pressure, is shown
not to be irreconcilable with the idea of the ice being sufficiently compact
to break into fragments, when the strain upon its parts is excessive;
as where the glacier turns a sharp angle, or descends upon a
rapid or convex slope. The increased velocity in summer is attributed
partly to the greater plasticity of the ice, when not exposed to intense
cold, and partly to the hydrostatic pressure of the water in the
capillary tubes, which imbibe more of this liquid in the hot season.</p>

<p>On the assumption of the ice being a rigid mass, Mr. Hopkins attributed
the more rapid motions in the centre to the unequal rate at which
the broad stripes of ice, intervening between longitudinal fissures, advance;
but besides that there are parts of the glacier where no such
fissures exist, such a mode of progression, says Mr. Forbes, would cause
the borders of large transverse rents or "crevasses," to be jagged like a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
saw, instead of being perfectly even and straight-edged.<a name="FNanchor_289" id="FNanchor_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> An experiment
recently made by Mr. Christie, secretary to the Royal Society, appears
to demonstrate that ice, under great pressure, possesses a sufficient degree
of moulding and self-adapting power to allow it to be acted upon,
as if it were a pasty substance. A hollow shell of iron an inch and a
half thick, the interior being ten inches in diameter, was filled with water,
in the course of a severe winter, and exposed to the frost, with the fuze-hole
uppermost. A portion of the water expanded in freezing, so as to
protrude a cylinder of ice from the fuze-hole; and this cylinder continued
to grow inch by inch in proportion as the central nucleus of water
froze. As we cannot doubt that an outer shell of ice is first formed,
and then another within, the continued rise of the column through the
fuze-hole must proceed from the squeezing of successive shells of ice
concentrically formed, through the narrow orifice; and yet the protruded
cylinder consisted of entire, and not fragmentary ice.<a name="FNanchor_290" id="FNanchor_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<p>The agency of glaciers in producing permanent geological changes consists
partly in their power of transporting gravel, sand, and huge stones
to great distances, and partly in the smoothing, polishing, and scoring
of their rocky channels, and the boundary walls of the valleys through
which they pass. At the foot of every steep cliff or precipice in high
Alpine regions, a talus is seen of rocky fragments detached by the alternate
action of frost and thaw. If these loose masses, instead of accumulating
on a stationary base, happen to fall upon a glacier, they will
move along with it, and, in place of a single heap, they will form in the
course of years a long stream of blocks. If a glacier be 20 miles long,
and its annual progression about 500 feet, it will require about two centuries
for a block thus lodged upon its surface to travel down from the
higher to the lower regions, or to the extremity of the icy mass. This
terminal point remains usually unchanged from year to year, although
every part of the ice is in motion, because the liquefaction by heat is just
sufficient to balance the onward movement of the glacier, which may be
compared to an endless file of soldiers, pouring into a breach, and shot
down as fast as they advance.</p>

<p>The stones carried along on the ice are called in Switzerland the
"moraines" of the glacier. There is always one line of blocks on each
side or edge of the icy stream, and often several in the middle, where they
are arranged in long ridges or mounds, often several yards high. (See
<a href="#f18">fig. 18</a>, p. 223.) The cause of these "medial moraines" was first explained
by Agassiz, who referred them to the confluence of tributary
glaciers.<a name="FNanchor_291" id="FNanchor_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Upon the union of two streams of ice, the right lateral moraine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
of one of the streams comes in contact with the left lateral moraine of
the other, and they afterwards move on together, in the centre, if the
confluent glaciers are equal in size, or nearer to one side if unequal.</p>

<p>All sand and fragments of soft stone which fall through fissures and
reach the bottom of the glaciers, or which are interposed between the
glacier and the steep sides of the valley, are pushed along, and ground
down into mud, while the larger and harder fragments have their angles
worn off. At the same time the fundamental and boundary rocks are
smoothed and polished, and often scored with parallel furrows, or with
lines and scratches produced by hard minerals, such as crystals of quartz,
which act like the diamond upon glass.<a name="FNanchor_292" id="FNanchor_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> This effect is perfectly different
from that caused by the action of water, or a muddy torrent forcing
along heavy fragments; for when stones are fixed firmly in the ice, and
pushed along by it under great pressure, in straight lines, they scoop out
long rectilinear furrows or grooves parallel to each other.<a name="FNanchor_293" id="FNanchor_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> The discovery
of such markings at various heights far above the surface of the
existing glaciers and for miles beyond their present terminations, affords
geological evidence of the former extension of the ice beyond its present
limits in Switzerland and other countries.</p>

<p>The moraine of the glacier, observes Charpentier, is entirely devoid of
stratification, for there has been no sorting of the materials, as in the case
of sand, mud, and pebbles, when deposited by running water. The ice
transports indifferently, and to the same spots, the heaviest blocks and
the finest particles, mingling all together, and leaving them in one confused
and promiscuous heap wherever it melts.<a name="FNanchor_294" id="FNanchor_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>

<p><i>Icebergs.</i>&mdash;In countries situated in high northern latitudes, like Spitzbergen,
between 70&deg; and 80&deg; N., glaciers, loaded with mud and rock,
descend to the sea, and there huge fragments of them float off and become
icebergs. Scoresby counted 500 of these bergs drifting along
in latitudes 69&deg; and 70&deg; N., which rose above the surface from the
height of 100 to 200 feet, and measured from a few yards to a mile in
circumference.<a name="FNanchor_295" id="FNanchor_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> Many of them were loaded with beds of earth and rock
of such thickness, that the weight was conjectured to be from 50,000 to
100,000 tons. Specimens of the rocks were obtained, and among them
were granite, gneiss, mica-schist, clay-slate, granular felspar, and greenstone.
Such bergs must be of great magnitude; because the mass of
ice below the level of the water is about eight times greater than that
above. Wherever they are dissolved, it is evident that the "moraine"
will fall to the bottom of the sea. In this manner may submarine valleys,
mountains, and platforms become strewed over with gravel, sand,
mud, and scattered blocks of foreign rock, of a nature perfectly dissimilar
from all in the vicinity, and which may have been transported across
unfathomable abysses. If the bergs happen to melt in still water, so
that the earthy and stony materials may fall tranquilly to the bottom,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
the deposit will probably be unstratified, like the terminal moraine of a
glacier; but whenever the materials are under the influence of a current
of water as they fall, they will be sorted and arranged according to their
relative weight and size, and therefore more or less perfectly stratified.</p>

<p>In a former chapter it was stated that some ice islands have been
known to drift from Baffin's Bay to the Azores, and from the South Pole
to the immediate neighborhood of the Cape of Good Hope, so that the
area over which the effects of moving ice may be experienced, comprehends
a large portion of the globe.</p>

<p>We learn from Von Buch that the most southern point on the continent
of Europe at which a glacier comes down to the sea is in Norway,
in lat. 67&deg; N.<a name="FNanchor_296" id="FNanchor_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> But Mr. Darwin has shown, that they extend to the
sea, in South America, in latitudes more than 20&deg; nearer the equator
than in Europe; as, for example, in Chili, where, in the Gulf of Penas,
lat. 46&deg; 40' S., or the latitude of central France; and in Sir George
Eyre's Sound, in the latitude of Paris, they give origin to icebergs, which
were seen in 1834 carrying angular pieces of granite, and stranding them
in fiords, where the shores were composed of clay-slate.<a name="FNanchor_297" id="FNanchor_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> A large proportion,
however, of the ice-islands seen floating both in the northern
and southern hemispheres, are probably not generated by glaciers, but
rather by the accumulation of coast ice. When the sea freezes at the
base of a lofty precipice, the sheet of ice is prevented from adhering to
the land by the rise and fall of the tide. Nevertheless, it often continues
on the shore at the foot of the cliff, and receives accessions of
drift snow blown from the land. Under the weight of this snow the ice
sinks slowly if the water be deep, and the snow is gradually converted
into ice by partial liquefaction and re-congelation. In this manner, islands
of ice of great thickness and many leagues in length, originate, and are
eventually blown out to sea by off-shore winds. In their interior are inclosed
many fragments of stone which had fallen upon them from overhanging
cliffs during their formation. Such floating icebergs are commonly
flat-topped, but their lower portions are liable to melt in latitudes
where the ocean at a moderate depth is usually warmer than the surface
water and the air. Hence their centre of gravity changes continually,
and they turn over and assume very irregular shapes.</p>

<p>In a voyage of discovery made in the antarctic regions in 1839, a dark-colored
angular mass of rock was seen imbedded in an iceberg, drifting
along in mid-ocean in lat. 61&deg; S. That part of the rock which was visible
was about 12 feet in height, and from 5 to 6 in width, but the dark
color of the surrounding ice indicated that much more of the stone was
concealed. A sketch made by Mr. Macnab, when the vessel was within
a quarter of a mile of it, is now published.<a name="FNanchor_298" id="FNanchor_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> This iceberg, one of many
observed at sea on the same day, was between 250 and 300 feet high,
and was no less than 1400 miles from any certainly known land. It is
exceedingly improbable, says Mr. Darwin, in his notice of this phenomenon,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
that any land will hereafter be discovered within 100 miles of the
spot, and it must be remembered that the erratic was still firmly fixed
in the ice, and may have sailed for many a league farther before it
dropped to the bottom.<a name="FNanchor_299" id="FNanchor_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p>Captain Sir James Ross, in his antarctic voyage in 1841, 42, and 43,
saw multitudes of icebergs transporting stones and rocks of various
sizes, with frozen mud, in high southern latitudes. His companion,
Dr. J. Hooker, informs me that he came to the conclusion that most
of the southern icebergs have stones in them, although they are usually
concealed from view by the quantity of snow which falls upon them.</p>

<p>In the account given by Messrs. Dease and Simpson, of their recent
arctic discoveries, we learn that in lat. 71&deg; N., long. 156&deg; W., they
found "a long low spit, named Point Barrow, composed of gravel and
coarse sand, in some parts more than a quarter of a mile broad, which
the pressure of the ice had forced up into numerous mounds, that,
viewed from a distance, assumed the appearance of huge boulder
rocks."<a name="FNanchor_300" id="FNanchor_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p>This fact is important, as showing how masses of drift ice, when
stranding on submarine banks, may exert a lateral pressure capable of
bending and dislocating any yielding strata of gravel, sand, or mud.
The banks on which icebergs occasionally run aground between Baffin's
Bay and Newfoundland, are many hundred feet under water, and the
force with which they are struck will depend not so much on the velocity
as the momentum of the floating ice-islands. The same berg is
often carried away by a change of wind, and then driven back again
upon the same bank, or it is made to rise and fall by the waves of the
ocean, so that it may alternately strike the bottom with its whole
weight, and then be lifted up again until it has deranged the superficial
beds over a wide area. In this manner the geologist may account, perhaps,
for the circumstance that in Scandinavia, Scotland, and other
countries where erratics are met with, the beds of sand, loam, and
gravel are often vertical, bent, and contorted into the most complicated
folds, while the underlying strata, although composed of equally pliant
materials, are horizontal. But some of these curvatures of loose strata
may also have been due to repeated alternations of layers of gravel and
sand, ice and snow, the melting of the latter having caused the intercalated
beds of indestructible matter to assume their present anomalous
position.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that icebergs must often break off the peaks
and projecting points of submarine mountains, and must grate upon and
polish their surface, furrowing or scratching them in precisely the same
way as we have seen that glaciers act on the solid rocks over which
they are propelled.<a name="FNanchor_301" id="FNanchor_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
To conclude: it appears that large stones, mud, and gravel are carried
down by the ice of rivers, estuaries, and glaciers, into the sea,
where the tides and currents of the ocean, aided by the wind, cause
them to drift for hundreds of miles from the place of their origin. Although
it will belong more properly to the seventh and eighth chapters
to treat of the transportation of solid matter by the movements of the
ocean, I shall add here what I have farther to say on this subject in
connection with ice.</p>

<p>The saline matter which sea-water holds in solution, prevents its congelation,
except where the most intense cold prevails. But the drifting
of the snow from the land often renders the surface-water brackish near
the coast, so that a sheet of ice is readily formed there, and by this
means a large quantity of gravel is frequently conveyed from place to
place, and heavy boulders also, when the coast-ice is packed into dense
masses. Both the large and small stones thus conveyed usually travel
in one direction like shingle-beaches, and this was observed to take
place on the coast of Labrador and Gulf of St. Lawrence, between the
latitudes 50&deg; and 60&deg; N., by Capt. Bayfield, during his late survey.
The line of coast alluded to is strewed over for a distance of 700 miles
with ice-borne boulders, often 6 feet in diameter, which are for the most
part on their way from north to south, or in the direction of the prevailing
current. Some points on this coast have been observed to be occasionally
deserted, and then again at another season thickly bestrewed
with erratics.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 19.</span><a name="f19" id="f19"></a><img src="images/f19.jpg" width="500" height="417" alt="Boulders, chiefly of granite, stranded by ice." title="" />

<p class="center2">Boulders, chiefly of granite, stranded by ice on the coast of Labrador, between lat. 50&deg; and 60&deg; N.
(Lieut. Bowen, R. N.)</p></div>

<p>The accompanying drawing (<a href="#f19">fig. 19</a>), for which I am indebted to
Lieut. Bowen, R. N., represents the ordinary appearance of the Labrador
coast, between the latitudes of 50&deg; and 60&deg; N. Countless blocks, chiefly
granitic, and of various sizes, are seen lying between high and low-water
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
mark. Capt. Bayfield saw similar masses carried by ice through the
Straits of Belle Isle, between Newfoundland and the American continent,
which he conceives may have travelled in the course of years
from Baffin's Bay, a distance which may be compared in our hemisphere
to the drifting of erratics from Lapland and Iceland as far south as Germany,
France, and England.</p>

<p>It may be asked in what manner have these blocks been originally
detached? We may answer that some have fallen from precipitous
cliffs, others have been lifted up from the bottom of the sea, adhering
by their tops to the ice, while others have been brought down by rivers
and glaciers.</p>

<p>The erratics of North America are sometimes angular, but most of
them have been rounded either by friction or decomposition. The
granite of Canada, as before remarked (p. 221 ), has a tendency to concentric
exfoliation, and scales off in spheroidal coats when exposed to
the spray of the sea during severe frosts. The range of the thermometer
in that country usually exceeds, in the course of the year, 100&deg;, and
sometimes 120&deg; F.; and, to prevent the granite used in the buildings
of Quebec from peeling off in winter, it is necessary to oil and paint the
squared stones.</p>

<p>In parts of the Baltic, such as the Gulf of Bothnia, where the quantity
of salt in the water amounts in general to one fourth only of that in
the ocean, the entire surface freezes over in winter to the depth of 5 or
6 feet. Stones are thus frozen in, and afterwards lifted up about 3 feet
perpendicularly on the melting of the snow in summer, and then carried
by floating ice-islands to great distances. Professor Von Baer states, in
a communication on this subject to the Academy of St. Petersburg, that
a block of granite, weighing a million of pounds, was carried by ice during
the winter of 1837-8 from Finland to the island of Hockland, and
two other huge blocks were transported about the years 1806 and 1814
by packed ice on the south coast of Finland, according to the testimony
of the pilots and inhabitants, one block having travelled about a quarter
of a mile, and lying about 18 feet above the level of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_302" id="FNanchor_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<p>More recently Dr. Forchhammer has shown that in the Sound, the
Great Belt, and other places near the entrance of the Baltic, ground-ice
forms plentifully at the bottom and then rises to the surface, charged
with sand and gravel, stones and sea-weed. Sheets of ice, also, with
included boulders, are driven up on the coast during storms, and "packed"
to a height of 50 feet. To the motion of such masses, but still
more to that of the ground-ice, the Danish professor attributes the striation
of rocky surfaces, forming the shores and bed of the sea, and he relates
a striking fact to prove that large quantities of rocky fragments
are annually carried by ice out of the Baltic. "In the year 1807," he
says, "at the time of the bombardment of the Danish fleet, an English
sloop-of-war, riding at anchor in the roads at Copenhagen, blew up. In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
1844, or thirty-seven years afterwards, one of our divers, known to be a
trustworthy man, went down to save whatever might yet remain in the
shipwrecked vessel. He found the space between decks entire, but
covered with blocks from 6 to 8 cubic feet in size, and some of them
heaped one upon the other. He also affirmed, that all the sunk ships
which he had visited in the Sound, were in like manner strewed over
with blocks."</p>

<p>Dr. Forchhammer also informs us, that during an intense frost in
February, 1844, the Sound was suddenly frozen over, and sheets of ice,
driven by a storm, were heaped up at the bottom of the Bay of T&auml;arbeijk,
threatening to destroy a fishing-village on the shore. The whole
was soon frozen together into one mass, and forced up on the beach,
forming a mound more than 16 feet high, which threw down the walls
of several buildings. "When I visited the spot next day, I saw ridges
of ice, sand, and pebbles, not only on the shore, but extending far out
into the bottom of the sea, showing how greatly its bed had been changed,
and how easily, where it is composed of rock, it may be furrowed and
streaked by stones firmly fixed in the moving ice."<a name="FNanchor_303" id="FNanchor_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<p><i>Origin of springs.</i>&mdash;The action of running water on the surface of the
land having been considered, we may next turn our attention to what
may be termed "the subterranean drainage," or the phenomena of
springs. Every one is familiar with the fact, that certain porous soils,
such as loose sand and gravel, absorb water with rapidity, and that the
ground composed of them soon dries up after heavy showers. If a well
be sunk in such soils, we often penetrate to considerable depths before
we meet with water; but this is usually found on our approaching the
lower parts of the formation, where it rests on some impervious bed; for
here the water, unable to make its way downwards in a direct line,
accumulates as in a reservoir, and is ready to ooze out into any opening
which may be made, in the same manner as we see the salt water flow
into, and fill, any hollow which we dig in the sands of the shore at low tide.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
The facility with which water can percolate loose and gravelly soils
is clearly illustrated by the effect of the tides in the Thames between
Richmond and London. The river, in this part of its course, flows
through a bed of gravel overlying clay, and the porous superstratum
is alternately saturated by the water of the Thames as the tide rises,
and then drained again to the distance of several hundred feet from the
banks when the tide falls, so that the wells in this tract regularly ebb
and flow.</p>

<p>If the transmission of water through a porous medium be so rapid,
we cannot be surprised that springs should be thrown out on the side
of a hill, where the upper set of strata consist of chalk, sand, or other
permeable substances, while the subjacent are composed of clay or
other retentive soils. The only difficulty, indeed, is to explain why the
water does not ooze out everywhere along the line of junction of the
two formations, so as to form one continuous land-soak, instead of a
few springs only, and these far distant from each other. The principal
cause of this concentration of the waters at a few points is, first, the
frequency of rents and fissures, which act as natural drains; secondly,
the existence of inequalities in the upper surface of the impermeable
stratum, which lead the water, as valleys do on the external surface of
a country, into certain low levels and channels.</p>

<p>That the generality of springs owe their supply to the atmosphere is
evident from this, that they become languid, or entirely cease to flow,
after long droughts, and are again replenished after a continuance of
rain. Many of them are probably indebted for the constancy and uniformity
of their volume to the great extent of the subterranean reservoirs
with which they communicate, and the time required for these to
empty themselves by percolation. Such a gradual and regulated discharge
is exhibited, though in a less perfect degree, in every great lake
which is not sensibly affected in its level by sudden showers, but only
slightly raised; so that its channel of efflux, instead of being swollen
suddenly like the bed of a torrent, is enabled to carry off the surplus
water gradually.</p>

<p>Much light has been thrown, of late years, on the theory of springs,
by the boring of what are called by the French "Artesian wells," because
the method has long been known and practised in Artois; and it
is now demonstrated that there are sheets, and in some places currents
of fresh water, at various depths in the earth. The instrument employed
in excavating these wells is a large augur, and the cavity bored
is usually from three to four inches in diameter. If a hard rock is met
with, it is first triturated by an iron rod, and the materials being thus
reduced to small fragments or powder, are readily extracted. To hinder
the sides of the well from falling in, as also to prevent the spreading of
the ascending water in the surrounding soil, a jointed pipe is introduced,
formed of wood in Artois, but in other countries more commonly of
metal. It frequently happens that, after passing through hundreds of
feet of retentive soils, a water-bearing stratum is at length pierced,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
when the fluid immediately ascends to the surface, and flows over.
The first rush of the water up the tube is often violent, so that for a time
the water plays like a fountain, and then, sinking, continues to flow over
tranquilly, or sometimes remains stationary at a certain depth below the
orifice of the well. This spouting of the water in the first instance is
probably owing to the disengagement of air and carbonic acid gas, for
both of these have been seen to bubble up with the water.<a name="FNanchor_304" id="FNanchor_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></p>

<p>At Sheerness, at the mouth of the Thames, a well was bored on a
low tongue of land near the sea, through 300 feet of the blue clay of
London, below which a bed of sand and pebbles was entered, belonging,
doubtless, to the plastic clay formation; when this stratum was pierced,
the water burst up with impetuosity, and filled the well. By another
perforation at the same place, the water was found at the depth of 328
feet below the surface clay; it first rose rapidly to the height of 189 feet,
and then, in the course of a few hours, ascended to an elevation of
eight feet above the level of the ground. In 1824 a well was dug at
Fulham, near the Thames, at the Bishop of London's, to the depth of
317 feet, which, after traversing the tertiary strata, was continued
through 67 feet of chalk. The water immediately rose to the surface,
and the discharge was about 50 gallons per minute. In the garden of
the Horticultural Society at Chiswick, the borings passed through 19
feet of gravel, 242&frac12; feet of clay and loam, and 67&frac12; feet of chalk, and
the water then rose to the surface from a depth of 329 feet.<a name="FNanchor_305" id="FNanchor_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> At the
Duke of Northumberland's, above Chiswick, the borings were carried to
the extraordinary depth of 620 feet, so as to enter the chalk, when a
considerable volume of water was obtained, which rose four feet above
the surface of the ground. In a well of Mr. Brooks, at Hammersmith,
the rush of water from a depth of 360 feet was so great, as to inundate
several buildings and do considerable damage; and at Tooting, a sufficient
stream was obtained to turn a wheel, and raise the water to the
upper stories of the houses.<a name="FNanchor_306" id="FNanchor_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> In 1838, the total supply obtained from
the chalk near London was estimated at six million gallons a day, and,
in 1851, at nearly double that amount, the increase being accompanied
by an average fall of no less than two feet a year in the level to which
the water rose. The water stood commonly, in 1822, at high-water
mark, and had sunk in 1851 to 45, and in some wells to 65 feet below
high-water mark.<a name="FNanchor_307" id="FNanchor_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> This fact shows the limited capacity of the subterranean
reservoir. In the last of three wells bored through the chalk
at Tours, to the depth of several hundred feet, the water rose 32 feet
above the level of the soil, and the discharge amounted to 300 cubic
yards of water every twenty-four hours.<a name="FNanchor_308" id="FNanchor_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></p>

<p>By way of experiment, the sinking of a well was commenced at Paris
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
in 1834, which had reached, in November, 1839, a depth of more than
1600 English feet, and yet no water ascended to the surface. The
government were persuaded by M. Arago to persevere, if necessary, to
the depth of more than 2000 feet; but when they had descended
above 1800 English feet below the surface, the water rose through
the tube (which was about ten inches in diameter), so as to discharge
half a million of gallons of limpid water every twenty-four hours. The
temperature of the water increased at the rate of 1&middot;8&deg; F. for every 101
English feet, as they went down, the result agreeing very closely with
the anticipations of the scientific advisers of this most spirited undertaking.</p>

<p>Mr. Briggs, the British consul in Egypt, obtained water between
Cairo and Suez, in a calcareous sand, at the depth of thirty feet; but
it did not rise in the well.<a name="FNanchor_309" id="FNanchor_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> But other borings in the same desert, of
variable depth, between 50 and 300 feet, and which passed through
alternations of sand, clay, and siliceous rock, yielded water at the
surface.<a name="FNanchor_310" id="FNanchor_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></p>

<p>The rise and overflow of the water in Artesian wells is generally
referred, and apparently with reason, to the same principle as the play
of an artificial fountain. Let the porous stratum or set of strata, <i>a</i> <i>a</i>,
rest on the impermeable rock <i>d</i>, and be covered by another mass of an
impermeable nature. The whole mass <i>a</i> <i>a</i> may easily, in such a position,
become saturated with water, which may descend from its higher
and exposed parts&mdash;a hilly region to which clouds are attracted, and
where rain falls in abundance. Suppose that at some point, as at <i>b</i>,
an opening be made, which gives a free passage upwards to the waters
confined in <i>a</i> <i>a</i>, at so low a level that they are subjected to the pressure
of a considerable column of water collected in the more elevated
portion of the same stratum. The water will then rush out, just as the
liquid from a large barrel which is tapped, and it will rise to a height
corresponding to the level of its point of departure, or, rather, to a
height which balances the pressure previously exerted by the confined
waters against the roof and sides of the stratum or reservoir <i>a</i> <i>a</i>. In
like manner, if there happen to be a natural fissure <i>c</i>, a spring will be
produced at the surface on precisely the same principle.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 20.</span><a name="f20" id="f20"></a><img src="images/f20.png" width="500" height="177"
alt="Artesian wells." title="" /></div>

<p>Among the causes of the failure of Artesian wells, we may mention
those numerous rents and faults which abound in some rocks, and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
deep ravines and valleys by which many countries are traversed; for,
when these natural lines of drainage exist, there remains a small quantity
only of water to escape by artificial issues. We are also liable to
be baffled by the great thickness either of porous or impervious strata,
or by the dip of the beds, which may carry off the waters from the adjoining
high lands to some trough in an opposite direction, as when the
borings are made at the foot of an escarpment where the strata incline
inwards, or in a direction opposite to the face of the cliffs.</p>

<p>The mere distance of hills or mountains need not discourage us from
making trials; for the waters which fall on these higher lands readily
penetrate to great depths through highly inclined or vertical strata, or
through the fissures of shattered rocks, and after flowing for a great
distance, must often reascend and be brought up again by other fissures,
so as to approach the surface in the lower country. Here they may
be concealed beneath the covering of undisturbed horizontal beds, which
it may be necessary to pierce in order to reach them. It should be
remembered, that the course of waters flowing under ground bears
but a remote resemblance to that of rivers on the surface, there being,
in the one case, a constant descent from a higher to a lower level from
the source of the stream to the sea; whereas, in the other, the water
may at one time sink far below the level of the ocean, and afterwards
rise again high above it.</p>

<p>Among other curious facts ascertained by aid of the borer, it is
proved that in strata of different ages and compositions, there are often
open passages by which the subterranean waters circulate. Thus, at
St. Ouen, in France, five distinct sheets of water were intersected in a
well, and from each of these a supply obtained. In the third waterbearing
stratum, at the depth of 150 feet, a cavity was found in which
the borer fell suddenly about a foot, and thence the water ascended in
great volume.<a name="FNanchor_311" id="FNanchor_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> The same falling of the instrument, as in a hollow
space, has been remarked in England and other countries. At Tours,
in 1830, a well was perforated quite through the chalk, when the
water suddenly brought up, from a depth of 364 feet, a great quantity
of fine sand, with much vegetable matter and shells. Branches of a
thorn several inches long, much blackened by their stay in the water,
were recognized, as also the stems of marsh plants, and some of their
roots, which were still white, together with the seeds of the same in a
state of preservation, which showed that they had not remained more
than three or four months in the water. Among the seeds were those
of the marsh plant <i>Galium uliginosum</i>; and among the shells, a freshwater
species (<i>Planorbis marginatus</i>), and some land species, as <i>Helix
rotundata</i>, and <i>H. striata</i>. M. Dujardin, who, with others, observed
this phenomenon, supposes that the waters had flowed from some valleys
of Auvergne or the Vivarais since the preceding autumn.<a name="FNanchor_312" id="FNanchor_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p>An analogous phenomenon is recorded at Reimke, near Bochum in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
Westphalia, where the water of an Artesian well brought up, from a
depth of 156 feet, several small fish, three or four inches long, the
nearest streams in the country being at a distance of some leagues.<a name="FNanchor_313" id="FNanchor_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>In both cases it is evident that water had penetrated to great
depths, not simply by filtering through a porous mass, for then it
would have left behind the shells, fish, and fragments of plants, but by
flowing through some open channels in the earth. Such examples
may suggest the idea that the leaky beds of rivers are often the feeders
of springs.</p>

<h5>MINERAL AND THERMAL SPRINGS.</h5>

<p>Almost all springs, even those which we consider the purest, are
impregnated with some foreign ingredients, which, being in a state of
chemical solution, are so intimately blended with the water as not to
affect its clearness, while they render it, in general, more agreeable to
our taste, and more nutritious than simple rain-water. But the springs
called mineral contain an unusual abundance of earthy matter in solution,
and the substances with which they are impregnated correspond remarkably
with those evolved in a gaseous form by volcanoes. Many of these
springs are thermal, <i>i. e.</i>, their temperature is above the mean temperature
of the place, and they rise up through all kinds of rock; as, for
example, through granite, gneiss, limestone, or lava, but are most frequent
in volcanic regions, or where violent earthquakes have occurred
at eras comparatively modern.</p>

<p>The water given out by hot springs is generally more voluminous and
less variable in quantity at different seasons than that proceeding from
any others. In many volcanic regions, jets of steam, called by the
Italians "stufas," issue from fissures, at a temperature high above the
boiling point, as in the neighborhood of Naples, and in the Lipari Isles,
and are disengaged unceasingly for ages. Now, if such columns of
steam, which are often mixed with other gases, should be condensed
before reaching the surface by coming in contact with strata filled with
cold water, they may give rise to thermal and mineral springs of every
degree of temperature. It is, indeed, by this means only, and not by
hydrostatic pressure, that we can account for the rise of such bodies of
water from great depths; nor can we hesitate to admit the adequacy of
the cause, if we suppose the expansion of the same elastic fluids to be
sufficient to raise columns of lava to the lofty summits of volcanic mountains.
Several gases, the carbonic acid in particular, are disengaged in
a free state from the soil in many districts, especially in the regions of
active or extinct volcanoes; and the same are found more or less intimately
combined with the waters of all mineral springs, both cold and
thermal. Dr. Daubeny and other writers have remarked, not only that
these springs are most abundant in volcanic regions, but that when
remote from them, their site usually coincides with the position of some
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
great derangement in the strata; a fault, for example, or great fissure,
indicating that a channel of communication has been opened with the
interior of the earth at some former period of local convulsion. It is
also ascertained that at great heights in the Pyrenees and Himalaya
mountains hot springs burst out from granitic rocks, and they are abundant
in the Alps also, these chains having all been disturbed and dislocated
at times comparatively modern, as can be shown by independent
geological evidence.</p>

<p>The small area of volcanic regions may appear, at first view, to present
an objection to these views, but not so when we include earthquakes
among the effects of igneous agency. A large proportion of
the land hitherto explored by geologists can be shown to have been
rent or shaken by subterranean movements since the oldest tertiary
strata were formed. It will also be seen, in the sequel, that new
springs have burst out, and others have had the volume of their waters
augmented, and their temperature suddenly raised after earthquakes, so
that the description of these springs might almost with equal propriety
have been given under the head of "igneous causes," as they are agents
of a mixed nature, being at once igneous and aqueous.</p>

<p>But how, it will be asked, can the regions of volcanic heat send forth
such inexhaustible supplies of water? The difficulty of solving this
problem would, in truth, be insurmountable, if we believed that all the
atmospheric waters found their way into the basin of the ocean; but in
boring near the shore we often meet with streams of fresh water at the
depth of several hundred feet below the sea level; and these probably
descend, in many cases, far beneath the bottom of the sea, when not
artificially intercepted in their course. Yet, how much greater may be
the quantity of salt water which sinks beneath the floor of the ocean,
through the porous strata of which it is often composed, or through
fissures rent in it by earthquakes. After penetrating to a considerable
depth, this water may encounter a heat of sufficient intensity to convert
it into vapor, even under the high pressure to which it would then be
subjected. This heat would probably be nearest the surface in volcanic
countries, and farthest from it in those districts which have been longest
free from eruptions or earthquakes.</p>

<p>It would follow from the views above explained, that there must be
a twofold circulation of terrestrial waters; one caused by solar heat,
and the other by heat generated in the interior of our planet. We
know that the land would be unfit for vegetation, if deprived of the
waters raised into the atmosphere by the sun; but it is also true that
mineral springs are powerful instruments in rendering the surface subservient
to the support of animal and vegetable life. Their heat is said
to promote the development of the aquatic tribes in many parts of the
ocean, and the substances which they carry up from the bowels of the
earth to the habitable surface, are of a nature and in a form which
adapts them peculiarly for the nutrition of animals and plants.</p>

<p>As these springs derive their chief importance to the geologist from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
the quantity and quality of the earthy materials which, like volcanoes,
they convey from below upwards, they may properly be considered in
reference to the ingredients which they hold in solution. These consist
of a great variety of substances; but chiefly salts with bases of lime,
magnesia, alumine, and iron, combined with carbonic, sulphuric, and muriatic
acids. Muriate of soda, silica, and free carbonic acid are frequently
present; also springs of petroleum, or liquid bitumen, and of naphtha.</p>

<p><i>Calcareous springs.</i>&mdash;Our first attention is naturally directed to springs
which are highly charged with calcareous matter, for these produce a
variety of phenomena of much interest in geology. It is known that
rain-water collecting carbonic acid from the atmosphere has the property
of dissolving the calcareous rocks over which it flows, and thus, in the
smallest ponds and rivulets, matter is often supplied for the earthy secretions
of testacea, and for the growth of certain plants on which they
feed. But many springs hold so much carbonic acid in solution, that
they are enabled to dissolve a much larger quantity of calcareous matter
than rain-water; and when the acid is dissipated in the atmosphere, the
mineral ingredients are thrown down, in the form of porous tufa or of
more compact travertin.<a name="FNanchor_314" id="FNanchor_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p><i>Auvergne.</i>&mdash;Calcareous springs, although most abundant in limestone
districts, are by no means confined to them, but flow out indiscriminately
from all rock formations. In central France, a district where the primary
rocks are unusually destitute of limestone, springs copiously
charged with carbonate of lime rise up through the granite and gneiss.
Some of these are thermal, and probably derive their origin from the
deep source of volcanic heat, once so active in that region. One of these
springs, at the northern base of the hill upon which Claremont is built,
issues from volcanic peperino, which rests on granite. It has formed,
by its incrustations, an elevated mound of travertin, or white concretionary
limestone, 240 feet in length, and, at its termination, sixteen feet
high and twelve wide. Another encrusting spring in the same department,
situated at Chaluzet, near Pont Gibaud, rises in a gneiss country,
at the foot of a regular volcanic cone, at least twenty miles from any
calcareous rock. Some masses of tufaceous deposit, produced by this
spring, have an oolitic texture.</p>

<p><i>Valley of the Elsa.</i>&mdash;If we pass from the volcanic district of France
to that which skirts the Apennines in the Italian peninsula, we meet
with innumerable springs which have precipitated so much calcareous
matter, that the whole ground in some parts of Tuscany is coated over
with tufa and travertin, and sounds hollow beneath the foot.</p>

<p>In other places in the same country, compact rocks are seen descending
the slanting sides of hills, very much in the manner of lava currents,
except that they are of a white color and terminate abruptly when they
reach the course of a river. These consist of a calcareous precipitate
from springs, some of which are still flowing, while others have disappeared
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
or changed their position. Such masses are frequent on the
slope of the hills which bound the valley of the Elsa, one of the tributaries
of the Arno, which flows near Colle, through a valley several hundred
feet deep, shaped out of a lacustrine formation, containing fossil
shells of existing species. I observed here that the travertin was unconformable
to the lacustrine beds, its inclination according with the
slope of the sides of the valley. One of the finest examples which I
saw was at the Molino delle Caldane, near Colle. The Sen&agrave;, and several
other small rivulets which feed the Elsa, have the property of encrusting
wood and herbs with calcareous stone. In the bed of the Elsa itself,
aquatic plants, such as Char&aelig;, which absorb large quantities of carbonate
of lime, are very abundant.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 21.</span><a name="f21" id="f21"></a><img src="images/f21.png" width="500" height="272" alt="Section of travertin, San Vignone." title="" />

<p class="center2">Section of travertin, San Vignone.</p></div>

<p><i>Baths of San Vignone.</i>&mdash;Those persons who have merely seen the
action of petrifying waters in England, will not easily form an adequate
conception of the scale on which the same process is exhibited in those
regions which lie nearer to the active centres of volcanic disturbance.
One of the most striking examples of the rapid precipitation of carbonate
of lime from thermal waters, occurs in the hill of San Vignone in Tuscany,
at a short distance from Radicofani, and only a few hundred yards
from the high road between Sienna and Rome. The spring issues from
near the summit of a rocky hill, about 100 feet in height. The top of
the hill stretches in a gently inclined platform to the foot of Mount
Amiata, a lofty eminence, which consists in great part of volcanic products.
The fundamental rock, from which the spring issues, is a black
slate, with serpentine (<i>b</i> <i>b</i>, <a href="#f21">fig. 21</a>), belonging to the older Apennine formation.
The water is hot, has a strong taste, and, when not in very
small quantity, is of a bright green color. So rapid is the deposition
near the source, that in the bottom of a conduit-pipe for carrying off
the water to the baths, and which is inclined at an angle of 30&deg;, half a
foot of solid travertin is formed every year. A more compact rock is
produced where the water flows slowly; and the precipitation in winter,
when there is least evaporation, is said to be more solid, but less in
quantity by one-fourth, than in summer. The rock is generally white;
some parts of it are compact, and ring to the hammer; others are cellular,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
and with such cavities as are seen in the carious part of bone or
the siliceous millstone of the Paris basin. A portion of it also below
the village of San Vignone consists of incrustations of long vegetable
tubes, and may be called tufa. Sometimes the travertin assumes precisely
the botryoidal and mammillary forms, common to similar deposits
in Auvergne, of a much older date; and, like them, it often scales off
in thin, slightly undulating layers.</p>

<p>A large mass of travertin (<i>c</i>, <a href="#f21">fig. 21</a>) descends the hill from the
point where the spring issues, and reaches to the distance of about half
a mile east of San Vignone. The beds take the slope of the hill at
about an angle of 6&deg;, and the planes of stratification are perfectly parallel.
One stratum, composed of many layers, is of a compact nature,
and fifteen feet thick; it serves as an excellent building stone, and a
mass of fifteen feet in length was, in 1828, cut out for the new bridge
over the Orcia. Another branch of it (<i>a</i>, <a href="#f21">fig. 21</a>) descends to the west,
for 250 feet in length, of varying thickness, but sometimes 200 feet
deep; it is then cut off by the small river Orcia, as some glaciers in
Switzerland descend into a valley till their progress is suddenly arrested
by a transverse stream of water.</p>

<p>The abrupt termination of the mass of rock at the river, where its
thickness is undiminished, clearly shows that it would proceed much
farther if not arrested by the stream, over which it impends slightly.
But it cannot encroach upon the channel of the Orcia, being constantly
undermined, so that its solid fragments are seen strewed amongst the
alluvial gravel. However enormous, therefore, the mass of solid rock
may appear which has been given out by this single spring, we may
feel assured that it is insignificant in volume when compared to that
which has been carried to the sea since the time when it began to flow.
What may have been the length of that period of time we have no
data for conjecturing. In quarrying the travertin, Roman tiles have
been sometimes found at the depth of five or six feet.</p>

<p><i>Baths of San Filippo.</i>&mdash;On another hill, not many miles from that
last mentioned, and also connected with Mount Amiata, the summit of
which is about three miles distant, are the celebrated baths of San
Filippo. The subjacent rocks consist of alternations of black slate, limestone,
and serpentine. There are three warm springs containing carbonate
and sulphate of lime, and sulphate of magnesia. The water
which supplies the baths falls into a pond, where it has been known to
deposit a solid mass <i>thirty feet thick</i> in about <i>twenty years</i>.<a name="FNanchor_315" id="FNanchor_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> A manufactory
of medallions in basso-relievo is carried on at these baths. The
water is conducted by canals into several pits, in which it deposits travertin
and crystals of sulphate of lime. After being thus freed from its
grosser parts, it is conveyed by a tube to the summit of a small chamber,
and made to fall through a space of ten or twelve feet. The current
is broken in its descent by numerous crossed sticks, by which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
spray is dispersed around upon certain moulds, which are rubbed
lightly over with a solution of soap, and a deposition of solid matter
like marble is the result, yielding a beautiful cast of the figures formed
in the mould. The geologist may derive from these experiments considerable
light, in regard to the high slope of the strata at which some
semi-crystalline precipitations can be formed; for some of the moulds
are disposed almost perpendicularly, yet the deposition is nearly equal
in all parts.</p>

<p>A hard stratum of stone, about a foot in thickness, is obtained from
the waters of San Filippo in four months; and, as the springs are
powerful, and almost uniform in the quantity given out, we are at no
loss to comprehend the magnitude of the mass which descends the
hill, which is a mile and a quarter in length and the third of a mile in
breadth, in some places attaining a thickness of 250 feet at least. To
what length it might have reached it is impossible to conjecture, as it is
cut off, like the travertin of San Vignone, by a small stream, where it
terminates abruptly. The remainder of the matter held in solution is
carried on probably to the sea.</p>

<p><i>Spheroidal structure in travertin.</i>&mdash;But what renders this recent
limestone of peculiar interest to the geologist, is the spheroidal form
which it assumes, analogous to that of the cascade of Tivoli, afterwards
to be described. (See <a href="#f22">fig. 22</a>, p. 244.) The lamination of some of the
concentric masses is so minute that sixty may be counted in the thickness
of an inch, yet, notwithstanding these marks of gradual and successive
deposition, sections are sometimes exhibited of what might seem
to be perfect spheres. This tendency to a mammillary and globular
structure arises from the facility with which the calcareous matter is
precipitated in nearly equal quantities on all sides of any fragment of
shell or wood or any inequality of the surface over which the mineral
water flows, the form of the nucleus being readily transmitted through
any number of successive envelopes. But these masses can never be
perfect spheres, although they often appear such when a transverse
section is made in any line not in the direction of the point of attachment.
There are, indeed, occasionally seen small oolitic and pisolitic
grains, of which the form is globular; for the nucleus, having been for
a time in motion in the water, has received fresh accessions of matter on
all sides.</p>

<p>In the same manner I have seen, on the vertical walls of large steam-boilers,
the heads of nails or rivets covered by a series of enveloping
crusts of calcareous matter, usually sulphate of lime; so that a concretionary
nodule is formed, preserving a nearly globular shape, when increased
to a mass several inches in diameter. In these, as in many travertins,
there is often a combination of the concentric and radiated structure.</p>

<p><i>Campagna di Roma.</i>&mdash;The country around Rome, like many parts of
the Tuscan States already referred to, has been at some former period
the site of numerous volcanic eruptions; and the springs are still
copiously impregnated with lime, carbonic acid, and sulphuretted hydrogen.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
A hot spring was discovered about 1827, near Civita Vecchia,
by Signor Riccioli, which deposits alternate beds of a yellowish travertin,
and a white granular rock, not distinguishable, in hand specimens,
either in grain, color, or composition, from statuary marble. There
is a passage between this and ordinary travertin. The mass accumulated
near the spring is in some places about six feet thick.</p>

<p><i>Lake of the Solfatara.</i>&mdash;In the Campagna, between Rome and Tivoli,
is the Lake of the Solfatara, called also Lago di Zolfo (lacus albula),
into which flows continually a stream of tepid water from a smaller
lake, situated a few yards above it. The water is a saturated solution
of carbonic acid gas, which escapes from it in such quantities in some
parts of its surface, that it has the appearance of being actually in ebullition.
"I have found by experiment," says Sir Humphry Davy, "that
the water taken from the most tranquil part of the lake, even after being
agitated and exposed to the air, contained in solution more than its
own volume of carbonic acid gas, with a very small quantity of sulphuretted
hydrogen. Its high temperature, which is pretty constant at 80&deg;
of Fahr., and the quantity of carbonic acid that it contains, render it
peculiarly fitted to afford nourishment to vegetable life. The banks of
travertin are everywhere covered with reeds, lichen, conferv&aelig;, and
various kinds of aquatic vegetables; and at the same time that the process
of vegetable life is going on, the crystallizations of the calcareous
matter, which is everywhere deposited, in consequence of the escape
of carbonic acid, likewise proceed. There is, I believe, no place in the
world where there is a more striking example of the opposition or contrast
of the laws of animate and inanimate nature, of the forces of inorganic
chemical affinity, and those of the powers of life."<a name="FNanchor_316" id="FNanchor_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

<p>The same observer informs us that he fixed a stick in a mass of
travertin covered by the water in the month of May, and in April following
he had some difficulty in breaking, with a sharp-pointed hammer,
the mass which adhered to the stick, and which was several inches in
thickness. The upper part was a mixture of light tufa and the leaves
of conferv&aelig;; below this was a darker and more solid travertin, containing
black and decomposed masses of conferv&aelig;; in the inferior part the
travertin was more solid, and of a gray color, but with cavities probably
produced by the decomposition of vegetable matter.<a name="FNanchor_317" id="FNanchor_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<p>The stream which flows out of this lake fills a canal about nine feet
broad and four deep, and is conspicuous in the landscape by a line of
vapor which rises from it. It deposits calcareous tufa in this channel,
and the Tiber probably receives from it, as well as from numerous other
streams, much carbonate of lime in solution, which may contribute to
the rapid growth of its delta. A large proportion of the most splendid
edifices of ancient and modern Rome are built of travertin, derived from
the quarries of Ponte Lucano, where there has evidently been a lake at
a remote period, on the same plain as that already described.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 22.</span><a name="f22" id="f22"></a><img src="images/f22.png" width="550" height="766"

<p class="center2">Section of spheroidal concretionary Travertin under the Cascade of Tivoli.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
<i>Travertin of Tivoli.</i>&mdash;In the same neighborhood the calcareous
waters of the Anio incrust the reeds which grow on its banks, and the
foam of the cataract of Tivoli forms beautiful pendant stalactites. On
the sides of the deep chasm into which the cascade throws itself, there
is seen an extraordinary accumulation of horizontal beds of tufa and
travertin, from four to five hundred feet in thickness. The section
immediately under the temples of Vesta and the Sibyl, displays, in a
precipice about four hundred feet high, some spheroids which are from
<i>six to eight feet in diameter</i>, each concentric layer being about the eighth
of an inch in thickness. The preceding diagram exhibits about fourteen
feet of this immense mass, as seen in the path cut out of the rock in descending
from the temple of Vesta to the Grotto di Nettuno. I have
not attempted to express in this drawing the innumerable thin layers of
which these magnificent spheroids are composed, but the lines given
mark some of the natural divisions into which they are separated by
minute variations in the size or color of the lamin&aelig;. The undulations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
also are much smaller in proportion to the whole circumference than in
the drawing. The beds (<i>a</i> <i>a</i>) are of hard travertin and soft tufa; below
them is a pisolite (<i>b</i>), the globules being of different sizes: underneath
this appears a mass of concretionary travertin (<i>c</i> <i>c</i>), some of the
spheroids being of the above-mentioned extraordinary size. In some
places (as at <i>d</i>) there is a mass of amorphous limestone, or tufa, surrounded
by concentric layers. At the bottom is another bed of
pisolite (<i>b</i>), in which the small nodules are about the size and shape
of beans, and some of them of filberts, intermixed with some smaller
oolitic grains. In the tufaceous strata, wood is seen converted into a
light tufa.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that the whole of this deposit was formed
in an extensive lake which existed when the external configuration of
this country varied greatly from that now observed. The Anio throws
itself into a ravine excavated in the ancient travertin, and its waters
give rise to masses of calcareous stone, scarcely if at all distinguishable
from the older rock. I was shown, in 1828, in the upper part of the
travertin, the hollow left by a cart-wheel, in which the outer circle and
the spokes had been decomposed, and the spaces which they filled left
void. It seemed to me at the time impossible to explain the position
of this mould without supposing that the wheel was imbedded before
the lake was drained; but Sir R. Murchison suggests that it may have
been washed down by a flood into the gorge in modern times, and then
incrusted with calcareous tufa in the same manner as the wooden beam
of the church of St. Lucia was swept down in 1826, and stuck fast in
the Grotto of the Syren, where it still remains, and will eventually be
quite imbedded in travertin.</p>

<p>I have already endeavored to explain (p. 241), when speaking of
the travertin of San Filippo, how the spheroidal masses represented in
figure 22 may have been formed.</p>

<p><i>Sulphureous and gypseus springs.</i>&mdash;The quantity of other mineral
ingredients wherewith springs in general are impregnated, is insignificant
in comparison to lime, and this earth is most frequently combined
with carbonic acid. But as sulphuric acid, and sulphuretted hydrogen
are very frequently supplied by springs, gypsum may, perhaps, be deposited
largely in certain seas and lakes. Among other gypseous
precipitates at present known on the land, I may mention those of
Baden, near Vienna, which feed the public bath. Some of these supply
singly from 600 to 1000 cubic feet of water per hour, and deposit
a fine powder, composed of a mixture of sulphate of lime with sulphur
and muriate of lime.<a name="FNanchor_318" id="FNanchor_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> The thermal waters of Aix, in Savoy, in passing
through strata of Jurassic limestone, turn them into gypsum or sulphate
of lime. In the Andes, at the Puenta del Inca, Lieutenant Brand
found a thermal spring at the temperature of 91&deg; Fahr., containing a
large proportion of gypsum with carbonate of lime and other ingredients.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
<a name="FNanchor_319" id="FNanchor_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a>
Many of the mineral springs of Iceland, says Mr. R. Bunsen,
deposit gypsum.<a name="FNanchor_320" id="FNanchor_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> and sulphureous acid gas escapes plentifully from
them as from the volcanoes of the same island. It may, indeed, be laid
down as a general rule, that the mineral substances dissolved in hot
springs agree very closely with those which are disengaged in a gaseous
form from the craters of active volcanoes.</p>

<p><i>Siliceous springs.&mdash;Azores.</i>&mdash;In order that water should hold a very
large quantity of silica in solution, it seems necessary that it should be
raised to a high temperature.<a name="FNanchor_321" id="FNanchor_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> The hot springs of the Valle das
Fernas, in the island of St. Michael, rising through volcanic rocks, precipitate
vast quantities of siliceous sinter. Around the circular basin of
the largest spring, which is between twenty and thirty feet in diameter,
alternate layers are seen of a coarser variety of sinter mixed with clay,
including grass, ferns, and reeds, in different states of petrifaction. In
some instances, alumina, which is likewise deposited from the hot
waters, is the mineralizing material. Branches of the same ferns which
now flourish in the island are found completely petrified, preserving the
same appearance as when vegetating, except that they acquire an ash-gray
color. Fragments of wood, and one entire bed from three to five
feet in depth, composed of reeds now common in the island, have become
completely mineralized.</p>

<p>The most abundant variety of siliceous sinter occurs in layers, from a
quarter to half an inch in thickness, accumulated on each other often
to the height of a foot and upwards, and constituting parallel, and for
the most part horizontal, strata many yards in extent. This sinter has
often a beautiful semi-opalescent lustre. A recent breccia is also in
the act of forming, composed of obsidian, pumice, and scori&aelig;, cemented
by siliceous sinter.<a name="FNanchor_322" id="FNanchor_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<p><i>Geysers of Iceland.</i>&mdash;But the hot springs in various parts of Iceland,
particularly the celebrated geysers, afford the most remarkable example
of the deposition of silex.<a name="FNanchor_323" id="FNanchor_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> The circular reservoirs into which the geysers
fall, are lined in the interior with a variety of opal, and round the
edges with sinter. The plants incrusted with the latter substance have
much the same appearance as those incrusted with calcareous tufa in
our own country. They consist of various grasses, the horse-tail
(<i>Equisetum</i>), and leaves of the birch-tree, which are the most common
of all, though no trees of this species now exist in the surrounding
country. The petrified stems also of the birch occur in a state much
resembling agatized wood.<a name="FNanchor_324" id="FNanchor_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<p>By analysis of the water, Mr. Faraday has ascertained that the solution
of the silex is promoted by the presence of the alkali, soda. He
suggests that the deposition of silica in an insoluble state takes place
partly because the water when cooled by exposure to the air is unable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
to retain as much silica as when it issues from the earth at a temperature
of 180&deg; or 190&deg; Fahr.; and partly because the evaporation of the
water decomposes the compound of silica and soda which previously
existed. This last change is probably hastened by the carbonic acid
of the atmosphere uniting with the soda. The alkali, when disunited
from the silica, would readily be dissolved in and removed by running
water.<a name="FNanchor_325" id="FNanchor_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>Mineral waters, even when charged with a small proportion of silica,
as those of Ischia, may supply certain species of corals, sponges, and infusoria,
with matter for their siliceous secretions; but there is little doubt
that rivers obtain silex in solution from another and far more general
source, namely, the decomposition of felspar. When this mineral,
which is so abundant an ingredient in the hypogene and trappean rocks,
has disintegrated, it is found that the residue, called porcelain clay, contains
a small proportion only of the silica which existed in the original
felspar, the other part having been dissolved and removed by water.<a name="FNanchor_326" id="FNanchor_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a></p>

<p><i>Ferruginous springs.</i>&mdash;The waters of almost all springs contain some
iron in solution; and it is a fact familiar to all, that many of them are
so copiously impregnated with this metal, as to stain the rocks or herbage
through which they pass, and to bind together sand and gravel into
solid masses. We may naturally, then, conclude that this iron, which
is constantly conveyed from the interior of the earth into lakes and seas,
and which does not escape again from them into the atmosphere by
evaporation, must act as a coloring and cementing principle in the subaqueous
deposits now in progress. Geologists are aware that many
ancient sandstones and conglomerates are bound together or colored
by iron.</p>

<p><i>Brine springs.</i>&mdash;So great is the quantity of muriate of soda in some
springs, that they yield one-fourth of their weight in salt. They are
rarely, however, so saturated, and generally contain, intermixed with
salt, carbonate and sulphate of lime, magnesia, and other mineral ingredients.
The brine springs of Cheshire are the richest in our country;
those of Northwich being almost saturated. Those of Barton also, in
Lancashire, and Droitwich in Worcestershire, are extremely rich.<a name="FNanchor_327" id="FNanchor_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> They
are known to have flowed for more than 1000 years, and the quantity
of salt which they have carried into the Severn and Mersey must be
enormous. These brine springs rise up through strata of sandstone and
red marl, which contain large beds of rock salt. The origin of the brine,
therefore, may be derived in this and many other instances from beds of
fossil salt; but as muriate of soda is one of the products of volcanic
emanations and of springs in volcanic regions, the original source of salt
may be as deep seated as that of lava.</p>

<p>Many springs in Sicily contain muriate of soda, and the "fiume salso,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
in particular, is impregnated with so large a quantity, that cattle refuse
to drink of it. A hot spring, rising through granite, at Saint Nectaire,
in Auvergne, may be mentioned as one of many, containing a large proportion
of muriate of soda, together with magnesia and other ingredients.<a name="FNanchor_328" id="FNanchor_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p><i>Carbonated springs.&mdash;Auvergne.</i>&mdash;Carbonic acid gas is very plentifully
disengaged from springs in almost all countries, but particularly near
active or extinct volcanoes. This elastic fluid has the property of decomposing
many of the hardest rocks with which it comes in contact, particularly
that numerous class in whose composition felspar is an ingredient.
It renders the oxide of iron soluble in water, and contributes, as was
before stated, to the solution of calcareous matter. In volcanic districts
these gaseous emanations are not confined to springs, but rise up in the
state of pure gas from the soil in various places. The Grotto del Cane,
near Naples, affords an example, and prodigious quantities are now
annually disengaged from every part of the Limagne d'Auvergne, where
it appears to have been developed in equal quantity from time immemorial.
As the acid is invisible, it is not observed, except an excavation
be made, wherein it immediately accumulates, so that it will extinguish
a candle. There are some springs in this district, where the water is
seen bubbling and boiling up with much noise, in consequence of the
abundant disengagement of this gas. In the environs of Pont-Gibaud,
not far from Clermont, a rock belonging to the gneiss formation, in which
lead-mines are worked, has been found to be quite saturated with carbonic
acid gas, which is constantly disengaged. The carbonates of iron,
lime, and manganese are so dissolved, that the rock is rendered soft, and
the quartz alone remains unattacked.<a name="FNanchor_329" id="FNanchor_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> Not far off is the small volcanic
cone of Chaluzet, which once broke up through the gneiss, and sent
forth a lava stream.</p>

<p><i>Supposed atmosphere of carbonic acid.</i>&mdash;Prof. Bischoff in his history
of volcanoes,<a name="FNanchor_330" id="FNanchor_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> has shown what enormous quantities of carbonic acid gas
are exhaled in the vicinity of the extinct craters of the Rhine (in the
neighborhood of the Laacher-see, for example, and the Eifel), and also
in the mineral springs of Nassau and other countries, where there are no
immediate traces of volcanic action. It would be easy to calculate in
how short a period the solid carbon, thus emitted from the interior of the
earth in an invisible form, would amount to a quantity as great as could
be obtained from the trees of a large forest, and how many thousand
years would be required to supply the materials of a dense seam of pure
coal from the same source. Geologists who favor the doctrine of the
former existence of an atmosphere highly charged with carbonic acid, at
the period of the ancient coal-plants, have not sufficiently reflected on
the continual disengagement of carbon, which is taking place in a gaseous
form from springs, as also in a free state from the ground and from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
volcanic craters into the air. We know that all plants are now engaged
in secreting carbon, and many thousands of large trees are annually
floated down by great rivers, and buried in their alluvial deposits; but
before we can assume that the quantity of carbon which becomes permanently
locked up in the earth by such agency will bring about an
essential change in the chemical composition of the atmosphere, we must
be sure that the trees annually buried contain more carbon than is given
out from the interior of the earth in the same lapse of time. Every large
area covered by a dense mass of peat, bears ample testimony to the fact,
that several million tons of carbon have been taken from the air, by the
powers of vegetable life, and stored up in the earth's crust, a large
quantity of oxygen having been at the same time set free; but we cannot
infer from these circumstances, that the constitution of the atmosphere
has been materially deranged, until we have data for estimating
the rate at which dead animal and vegetable substances are daily putrefying,&mdash;organic
remains and various calcareous rocks decomposing, and
volcanic regions emitting fresh volumes of carbonic acid gas. That the
ancient carboniferous period was one of vast duration all geologists are
agreed; instead, therefore, of supposing an excess of carbonic acid in
the air at that epoch, for the support of a peculiar flora, we may imagine
Time to have multiplied the quantity of carbon given out annually by
mineral springs, volcanic craters, and other sources, until the component
elements of any given number of coal-seams had been evolved from below,
without any variation taking place in the constitution of the atmosphere.
It has been too common, in reasoning on this question, to compute
the loss of carbon by the volume of coal stored up in the ancient
strata, and to take no account of the annual gain, by the restoration of
carbonic acid to the atmosphere, through the machinery above alluded to.<a name="FNanchor_331" id="FNanchor_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<p><i>Disintegrating effects of carbonic acid.</i>&mdash;The disintegration of granite
is a striking feature of large districts in Auvergne, especially in the
neighborhood of Clermont. This decay was called by Dolomieu, "la
maladie du granite;" and the rock may with propriety be said to have
<i>the rot</i>, for it crumbles to pieces in the hand. The phenomenon may,
without doubt, be ascribed to the continual disengagement of carbonic
acid gas from numerous fissures.</p>

<p>In the plains of the Po, between Verona and Parma, especially at
Villa Franca, south of Mantua, I observed great beds of alluvium, consisting
chiefly of primary pebbles, percolated by spring-water, charged
with carbonate of lime and carbonic acid in great abundance. They are
for the most part incrusted with calc-sinter; and the rounded blocks of
gneiss, which have all the outward appearance of solidity, have been so
disintegrated by the carbonic acid as readily to fall to pieces.</p>

<p>The subtraction of many of the elements of rocks by the solvent power
of carbonic acid, ascending both in a gaseous state and mixed with
spring-water in the crevices of rocks, must be one of the most powerful
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
sources of those internal changes and rearrangements of particles so
often observed in strata of every age. The calcareous matter, for example,
of shells, is often entirely removed and replaced by carbonate of
iron, pyrites, silex, or some other ingredient, such as mineral waters
usually contain in solution. It rarely happens, except in limestone
rocks, that the carbonic acid can dissolve all the constituent parts of the
mass; and for this reason, probably, calcareous rocks are almost the
only ones in which great caverns and long winding passages are found.</p>

<p><i>Petroleum springs.</i>&mdash;Springs of which the waters contain a mixture
of petroleum and the various minerals allied to it, as bitumen, naphtha,
asphaltum, and pitch, are very numerous, and are, in many cases, undoubtedly
connected with subterranean fires, which raise or sublime the
more subtle parts of the bituminous matters contained in rocks. Many
springs in the territory of Modena and Parma, in Italy, produce petroleum
in abundance; but the most powerful, perhaps, yet known, are
those on the Irawadi, in the Burman empire. In one locality there are
said to be 520 wells, which yield annually 400,000 hogsheads of petroleum.<a name="FNanchor_332" id="FNanchor_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p><i>Pitch lake of Trinidad.</i>&mdash;Fluid bitumen is seen to ooze from the
bottom of the sea, on both sides of the island of Trinidad, and to rise
up to the surface of the water. Near Cape La Braye there is a vortex
which, in stormy weather, according to Captain Mallet, gushes out,
raising the water five or six feet, and covers the surface for a considerable
space with petroleum, or tar; and the same author quotes Gumilla,
as stating, in his "Description of the Orinoco," that about seventy years
ago, a spot of land on the western coast of Trinidad, near half-way between
the capital and an Indian village, sank suddenly, and was immediately
replaced by a small lake of pitch, to the great terror of the
inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_333" id="FNanchor_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<p>It is probable that the great pitch lake of Trinidad owes its origin to
a similar cause; and Dr. Nugent has justly remarked, that in that district
all the circumstances are now combined from which deposits of
pitch may have originated. The Orinoco has for ages been rolling
down great quantities of woody and vegetable bodies into the surrounding
sea, where, by the influence of currents and eddies, they may be
arrested and accumulated in particular places. The frequent occurrence
of earthquakes and other indications of volcanic action in those parts
lend countenance to the opinion, that these vegetable substances may
have undergone, by the agency of subterranean fire, those transformations
and chemical changes which produce petroleum; and this may,
by the same causes, be forced up to the surface, where, by exposure to
the air, it becomes inspissated, and forms the different varieties of pure
and earthy pitch, or asphaltum, so abundant in the island.<a name="FNanchor_334" id="FNanchor_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
It may be stated generally, that a large portion of the finer particles
and the more crystalline substances, found in sedimentary rocks of different
ages, are composed of the same elements as are now held in solution
by springs, while the coarser materials bear an equally strong
resemblance to the pebbles and sedimentary matter carried down by
torrents and rivers. It should also be remembered, that it is not only
during inundations, when the muddy sediment is apparent, that rivers
are busy in conveying solid matter to the sea, but that even when their
waters are perfectly transparent, they are annually bearing along vast
masses of carbon, lime, and silica to the ocean.</p>

<h6>DELTAS IN LAKES.</h6>

<p>I have already spoken in the 14th chapter of the action of running
water, and of the denuding power of rivers, but we can only form a
just conception of the excavating and removing force exerted by such
bodies of water, when we have the advantage of examining the reproductive
effects of the same agents: in other words, of beholding in a
palpable form the aggregate amount of matter, which they have thrown
down at certain points in their alluvial plains, or in the basins of lakes
and seas. Yet it will appear, when we consider the action of currents,
that the growth of deltas affords a very inadequate standard by which
to measure the entire carrying power of running water, since a considerable
portion of fluviatile sediment is swept far out to sea.</p>

<p>Deltas may be divided into, first, those which are formed in lakes;
secondly, those in island seas, where the tides are almost imperceptible;
and, thirdly, those on the borders of the ocean. The most characteristic
distinction between the lacustrine and marine deltas consists in
the nature of the organic remains which become imbedded in their
deposits; for, in the case of a lake, it is obvious that these must
consist exclusively of such genera of animals as inhabit the land or
the waters of a river or a lake; whereas, in the other case, there will
be an admixture, and most frequently a predominance, of animals which
inhabit salt water. In regard, however, to the distribution of inorganic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
matter, the deposits of lakes and seas are formed under very analogous
circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Lake of Geneva.</i>&mdash;Lakes exemplify the first reproductive operations
in which rivers are engaged when they convey the detritus of rocks
and the ingredients of mineral springs from mountainous regions. The
accession of new land at the mouth of the Rhone, at the upper end of
the Lake of Geneva, or the Leman Lake, presents us with an example
of a considerable thickness of strata which have accumulated since the
historical era. This sheet of water is about thirty-seven miles long, and
its breadth is from two to eight miles. The shape of the bottom is
very irregular, the depth having been found by late measurements to
vary from 20 to 160 fathoms.<a name="FNanchor_335" id="FNanchor_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> The Rhone, where it enters at the upper
end, is turbid and discolored; but its waters, where it issues at the
town of Geneva, are beautifully clear and transparent. An ancient
town, called Port Vallais (Portus Valesi&aelig; of the Romans), once situated
at the water's edge, at the upper end, is now more than a mile and a
half inland&mdash;this intervening alluvial tract having been acquired in
about eight centuries. The remainder of the delta consists of a flat
alluvial plain, about five or six miles in length, composed of sand and
mud, a little raised above the level of the river, and full of marshes.</p>

<p>Sir Henry De la Beche found, after numerous soundings in all parts
of the lake, that there was a pretty uniform depth of from 120 to 160
fathoms throughout the central region, and on approaching the delta,
the shallowing of the bottom began to be very sensible at a distance
of about a mile and three quarters from the mouth of the Rhone;
for a line drawn from St. Gingoulph to Vevey gives a mean depth
of somewhat less than 600 feet, and from that part of the Rhone,
the fluviatile mud is always found along the bottom.<a name="FNanchor_336" id="FNanchor_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> We may state,
therefore, that the new strata annually produced are thrown down
upon a slope about two miles in length; so that, notwithstanding the
great depth of the lake, the new deposits are inclined at so slight an
angle, that the dip of the beds would be termed, in ordinary geological
language, horizontal.</p>

<p>The strata probably consist of alternations of finer and coarser particles;
for, during the hotter months from April to August, when the
snows melt, the volume and velocity of the river are greatest, and large
quantities of sand, mud, vegetable matter, and drift-wood are introduced;
but during the rest of the year, the influx is comparatively
feeble, so much so, that the whole lake, according to Saussure, stands
six feet lower. If, then, we could obtain a section of the accumulation
formed in the last eight centuries, we should see a great series of
strata, probably from 600 to 900 feet thick (the supposed original
depth of the head of the lake), and nearly two miles in length, inclined
at a very slight angle. In the mean time, a great number of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
smaller deltas are growing around the borders of the lake, at the
mouths of rapid torrents, which pour in large masses of sand and pebbles.
The body of water in these torrents is too small to enable them
to spread out the transported matter over so extensive an area as the
Rhone does. Thus, for example, there is a depth of eighty fathoms
within half a mile of the shore, immediately opposite the great torrent
which enters east of Ripaille, so that the dip of the strata in that minor
delta must be about four times as great as those deposited by the main
river at the upper extremity of the lake.<a name="FNanchor_337" id="FNanchor_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p><i>Chronological computations of the age of deltas.</i>&mdash;The capacity of this
basin being now ascertained, it would be an interesting subject of inquiry,
to determine in what number of years the Leman Lake will be
converted into dry land. It would not be very difficult to obtain the
elements for such a calculation, so as to approximate at least to the
quantity of time required for the accomplishment of the result. The
number of cubic feet of water annually discharged by the river into the
lake being estimated, experiments might be made in the winter and
summer months, to determine the proportion of matter held in suspension
or in chemical solution by the Rhone. It would be also necessary
to allow for the heavier matter drifted along at the bottom, which
might be estimated on hydrostatical principles, when the average size of
the gravel and the volume and velocity of the stream at different seasons
were known. Supposing all these observations to have been made, it
would be more easy to calculate the future than the former progress of
the delta, because it would be a laborious task to ascertain, with any
degree of precision, the original depth and extent of that part of the
lake which is already filled up. Even if this information were actually
obtained by borings, it would only enable us to approximate within a
certain number of centuries to the time when the Rhone began to form
its present delta; but this would not give us the date of the origin of
the Leman Lake in its present form, because the river may have flowed
into it for thousands of years, without importing any sediment whatever.
Such would have been the case, if the waters had first passed through a
chain of upper lakes; and that this was actually the fact, seems indicated
by the course of the Rhone between Martigny and the Lake of Geneva,
and, still more decidedly, by the channels of many of its principal feeders.</p>

<p>If we ascend, for example, the valley through which the Dranse flows,
we find that it consists of a succession of basins, one above the other, in
each of which there is a wide expanse of flat alluvial lands, separated
from the next basin by a rocky gorge, once perhaps the barrier of a lake.
The river seems to have filled these lakes, one after the other, and to
have partially cut through the barriers, some of which it is still gradually
eroding to a greater depth. Before, therefore, we can pretend even
to hazard a conjecture as to the era at which the principal delta of Lake
Leman or any other delta commenced, we must be thoroughly acquainted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
with the geographical features and geological history of the whole
system of higher valleys which communicate with the main stream, and
all the changes which they have undergone since the last series of convulsions
which agitated and altered the face of the country.</p>

<p><i>Lake Superior.</i>&mdash;Lake Superior is the largest body of freshwater in
the world, being above 1700 geographical miles in circumference when
we follow the sinuosities of its coasts, and its length, on a curved line
drawn through its centre, being more than 400, and its extreme breadth
above 150 geographical miles. Its surface is nearly as large as the
whole of England. Its average depth varies from 80 to 150 fathoms;
but, according to Captain Bayfield, there is reason to think that its
greatest depth would not be overrated at 200 fathoms, so that its bottom
is, in some parts, nearly 600 feet below the level of the Atlantic, its surface
being about as much above it. There are appearances in different
parts of this, as of the other Canadian lakes, leading us to infer that its
waters formerly occupied a higher level than they reach at present; for
at a considerable distance from the present shores, parallel lines of rolled
stones and shells are seen rising one above the other, like the seats of
an amphitheatre. These ancient lines of shingle are exactly similar to
the present beaches in most bays, and they often attain an elevation of
40 or 50 feet above the present level. As the heaviest gales of wind
do not raise the waters more than three or four feet, the elevated beaches
have by some been referred to the subsidence of the lake at former periods,
in consequence of the wearing down of its barrier; by others to
the upraising of the shores by earthquakes, like those which have produced
similar phenomena on the coast of Chili.</p>

<p>The streams which discharge their waters into Lake Superior are several
hundred in number, without reckoning those of smaller size; and
the quantity of water supplied by them is many times greater than that
discharged at the Falls of St. Mary, the only outlet. The evaporation,
therefore, is very great, and such as might be expected from so vast an
extent of surface. On the northern side, which is encircled by primary
mountains, the rivers sweep in many large boulders with smaller gravel
and sand, chiefly composed of granitic and trap rocks. There are also
currents in the lake in various directions, caused by the continued prevalence
of strong winds, and to their influence we may attribute the diffusion
of finer mud far and wide over great areas; for by numerous
soundings made during Captain Bayfield's survey, it was ascertained
that the bottom consists generally of a very adhesive clay, containing
shells of the species at present existing in the lake. When exposed to
the air, this clay immediately becomes indurated in so great a degree, as
to require a smart blow to break it. It effervesces slightly with diluted
nitric acid, and is of different colors in different parts of the lake; in one
district blue, in another red, and in a third white, hardening into a substance
resembling pipeclay.<a name="FNanchor_338" id="FNanchor_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> From these statements, the geologist will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
not fail to remark how closely these recent lacustrine formations in
America resemble the tertiary argillaceous and calcareous marls of lacustrine
origin in Central France. In both cases many of the genera of
shells most abundant, as Limnea and Planorbis, are the same; and in
regard to other classes of organic remains there must be the closest
analogy, as I shall endeavor more fully to explain when speaking of the
imbedding of plants and animals in recent deposits.</p>

<h5>DELTAS OF INLAND SEAS.</h5>

<p>Having thus briefly considered some of the lacustrine deltas now in
progress, we may next turn our attention to those of inland seas.</p>

<p><i>Course of the Po.</i>&mdash;The Po affords an instructive example of the
manner in which a great river bears down to the sea the matter poured
into it by a multitude of tributaries descending from lofty chains of
mountains. The changes gradually effected in the great plain of Northern
Italy, since the time of the Roman republic, are considerable. Extensive
lakes and marshes have been gradually filled up, as those near
Placentia, Parma, and Cremona, and many have been drained naturally
by the deepening of the beds of rivers. Deserted river-courses are not
unfrequent, as that of the Serio Morto, which formerly fell into the
Adda, in Lombardy. The Po also itself has often deviated from its
course, having after the year 1390 deserted part of the territory of
Cremona, and invaded that of Parma; its old channel being still recognizable,
and bearing the name of Po Morto. There is also an old channel
of the Po in the territory of Parma, called Po Vecchio, which was
abandoned in the twelfth century, when a great number of towns were
destroyed.</p>

<p><i>Artificial embankments of Italian rivers.</i>&mdash;To check these and similar
aberrations, a general system of embankment has been adopted; and
the Po, Adige, and almost all their tributaries, are now confined between
high artificial banks. The increased velocity acquired by streams thus
closed in, enables them to convey a much larger portion of foreign matter
to the sea; and, consequently, the deltas of the Po and Adige have
gained far more rapidly on the Adriatic since the practice of embankment
became almost universal. But, although more sediment is borne
to the sea, part of the sand and mud, which in the natural state of
things would be spread out by annual inundations over the plain, now
subsides in the bottom of the river-channels; and their capacity being
thereby diminished, it is necessary, in order to prevent inundations in
the following spring, to extract matter from the bed, and to add it to
the banks of the river. Hence it happens that these streams now traverse
the plain on the top of high mounds, like the waters of aqueducts,
and at Ferrara the surface of the Po has become more elevated than
the roofs of the houses.<a name="FNanchor_339" id="FNanchor_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> The magnitude of these barriers is a subject
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
of increasing expense and anxiety, it having been sometimes found necessary
to give an additional height of nearly one foot to the banks of the
Adige and Po in a single season.</p>

<p>The practice of embankment was adopted on some of the Italian
rivers as early as the thirteenth century; and Dante, writing in the
beginning of the fourteenth, describes, in the seventh circle of hell, a
rivulet of tears separated from a burning sandy desert by embankments
"like those which, between Ghent and Bruges, were raised against the
ocean, or those which the Paduans had erected along the Brenta to
defend their villas on the melting of the Alpine snows."</p>

</div>

<p><br />In the Adriatic, from the northern part of the Gulf of Trieste, where
the Isonzo enters, down to the south of Ravenna, there is an uninterrupted
series of recent accessions of land, more than 100 miles in length,
which, within the last 2000 years, have increased from <i>two to twenty
miles in breadth</i>. A line of sand-bars of great length has been formed
nearly all along the western coast of this gulf, inside of which are
lagunes, such as those of Venice, and the large lagune of Comacchio,
20 miles in diameter. Newly deposited mud brought down by the
streams is continually lessening the depth of the lagunes, and converting
part of them into meadows.<a name="FNanchor_340" id="FNanchor_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> The Isonzo, Tagliamento, Piave, Brenta,
Adige, and Po, besides many other inferior rivers, contribute to this
advance of the coast-line and to the shallowing of the lagunes and the
gulf.</p>

<p><i>Delta of the Po.</i>&mdash;The Po and the Adige may now be considered as
entering by one common delta, for two branches of the Adige are connected
with arms of the Po, and thus the principal delta has been
pushed out beyond those bars which separate the lagunes from the sea.
The rate of the advance of this new land has been accelerated, as before
stated, since the system of embanking the rivers became general, especially
at that point where the Po and Adige enter. The waters are no
longer permitted to spread themselves far and wide over the plains, and
to leave behind them the larger portion of their sediment. Mountain
torrents also have become more turbid since the clearing away of forests,
which once clothed the southern flanks of the Alps. It is calculated
that the mean rate of advance of the delta of the Po on the
Adriatic between the years 1200 and 1600 was 25 yards or metres a
year, whereas the mean annual gain from 1600 to 1804 was 70 metres.<a name="FNanchor_341" id="FNanchor_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>Adria was a seaport in the time of Augustus, and had, in ancient
times, given its name to the gulf; it is now about twenty Italian miles
inland. Ravenna was also a seaport, and is now about four miles from
the main sea. Yet even before the practice of embankment was introduced,
the alluvium of the Po advanced with rapidity on the Adriatic;
for Spina, a very ancient city, originally built in the district of Ravenna,
at the mouth of a great arm of the Po, was, so early as the commencement
of our era, eleven miles distant from the sea.<a name="FNanchor_342" id="FNanchor_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></p>

<p>But although so many rivers are rapidly converting the Adriatic into
land, it appears, by the observations of M. Morlot, that since the time
of the Romans, there has been a general subsidence of the coast and
bed of this sea in the same region to the amount of five feet, so that
the advance of the new-made land has not been so fast as it would have
been had the level of the coast remained unaltered. The signs of a
much greater depression anterior to the historical period have also been
brought to light by an Artesian well, bored in 1847, to the depth of
more than 400 feet, which still failed to penetrate through the modern
fluviatile deposit. The auger passed chiefly through beds of sand and
clay, but at four several depths, one of them very near the bottom of
the excavation, it pierced beds of turf, or accumulations of vegetable
matter, precisely similar to those now formed superficially on the extreme
borders of the Adriatic. Hence we learn that a considerable
area of what was once land has sunk down 400 feet in the course of
ages.<a name="FNanchor_343" id="FNanchor_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<p>The greatest depth of the Adriatic, between Dalmatia and the mouths
of the Po, is twenty-two fathoms; but a large part of the Gulf of Trieste
and the Adriatic, opposite Venice, is less than twelve fathoms deep.
Farther to the south, where it is less affected by the influx of great
rivers, the gulf deepens considerably. Donati, after dredging the bottom,
discovered the new deposits to consist partly of mud and partly of rock,
the rock being formed of calcareous matter, incrusting shells. He also
ascertained, that particular species of testacea were grouped together in
certain places, and were becoming slowly incorporated with the mud or
calcareous precipitates.<a name="FNanchor_344" id="FNanchor_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> Olivi, also, found some deposits of sand, and
others of mud, extending half way across the gulf; and he states that
their distribution along the bottom was evidently determined by the
prevailing current.<a name="FNanchor_345" id="FNanchor_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> It is probable, therefore, that the finer sediment
of all the rivers at the head of the Adriatic may be intermingled by the
influence of the current; and all the central parts of the gulf may be
considered as slowly filling up with horizontal deposits, similar to those
of the Subapennine hills, and containing many of the same species of
shells. The Po merely introduces at present fine sand and mud, for it
carries no pebbles farther than the spot where it joins the Trebia, west
of Piacenza. Near the northern borders of the basin, the Isonzo,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
Tagliamento, and many other streams, are forming immense beds of
sand and some conglomerate; for here some high mountains of Alpine
limestone approach within a few miles of the sea.</p>

<p>In the time of the Romans, the hot-baths of Monfalcone were on one
of several islands of Alpine limestone, between which and the mainland,
on the north, was a channel of the sea, about a mile broad. This channel
is now converted into a grassy plain, which surrounds the islands on
all sides. Among the numerous changes on this coast, we find that the
present channel of the Isonzo is several miles to the west of its ancient
bed, in part of which, at Ronchi, the old Roman bridge which crossed
the Via Appia was lately found buried in fluviatile silt.</p>

<p><i>Marine delta of the Rhone.</i>&mdash;The lacustrine delta of the Rhone in
Switzerland has already been considered (p. 251), its contemporaneous
marine delta may now be described. Scarcely has the river passed out
of the Lake of Geneva before its pure waters are again filled with sand
and sediment by the impetuous Arve, descending from the highest Alps,
and bearing along in its current the granitic detritus annually brought
down by the glaciers of Mont Blanc. The Rhone afterwards receives
vast contributions of transported matter from the Alps of Dauphiny,
and the primary and volcanic mountains of Central France; and when
at length it enters the Mediterranean, it discolors the blue waters of
that sea with a whitish sediment, for the distance of between six and
seven miles, throughout which space the current of fresh water is perceptible.</p>

<p>Strabo's description of the delta is so inapplicable to its present configuration,
as to attest a complete alteration in the physical features of
the country since the Augustan age. It appears, however, that the
head of the delta, or the point at which it begins to ramify, has remained
unaltered since the time of Pliny, for he states that the Rhone
divided itself at Arles into two arms. This is the case at present; one
of the branches, the western, being now called Le Petit Rh&ocirc;ne, which
is again subdivided before entering the Mediterranean. The advance of
the base of the delta, in the last eighteen centuries, is demonstrated by
many curious antiquarian monuments. The most striking of these is the
great and unnatural d&eacute;tour of the old Roman road from Ugernum to
Beziers (<i>B&oelig;terr&aelig;</i>) which went round by Nismes (<i>Nemausus</i>). It is
clear that, when this was first constructed, it was impossible to pass in
a direct line, as now, across the delta, and that either the sea or marshes
intervened in a tract now consisting of terra firma.<a name="FNanchor_346" id="FNanchor_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> Astruc also
remarks, that all the places on low lands, lying to the north of the old
Roman road between Nismes and Beziers, have names of Celtic origin,
evidently given to them by the first inhabitants of the country; whereas,
the places lying south of that road, towards the sea, have names of
Latin derivation, and were clearly founded after the Roman language
had been introduced.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
Another proof, also, of the great extent of land which has come into
existence since the Romans conquered and colonized Gaul, is derived
from the fact, that the Roman writers never mention the thermal
waters of Balaruc in the delta, although they were well acquainted with
those of Aix, and others still more distant, and attached great importance
to them, as they invariably did to all hot springs. The waters of
Balaruc, therefore, must have formerly issued under the sea&mdash;a common
phenomenon on the borders of the Mediterranean; and on the
advance of the delta they continued to flow out through the new
deposits.</p>

<p>Among the more direct proofs of the increase of land, we find that
Mese, described under the appellation of Mesua Collis by Pomponius
Mela,<a name="FNanchor_347" id="FNanchor_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> and stated by him to be nearly an island, is now far inland.
Notre Dame des Ports, also, was a harbor in 898, but is now a league
from the shore. Psalmodi was an island in 815, and is now two
leagues from the sea. Several old lines of towers and sea-marks occur
at different distances from the present coast, all indicating the successive
retreat of the sea, for each line has in its turn become useless to
mariners; which may well be conceived, when we state that the Tower
of Tignaux, erected on the shore so late as the year 1737, is already a
mile remote from it.<a name="FNanchor_348" id="FNanchor_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<p>By the confluence of the Rhone and the currents of the Mediterranean,
driven by winds from the south, sand-bars are often formed across
the mouths of the river; by these means considerable spaces become
divided off from the sea, and subsequently from the river also, when it
shifts its channels of efflux. As some of these lagoons are subject to
the occasional ingress of the river when flooded, and of the sea during
storms, they are alternately salt and fresh. Others, after being filled
with salt water, are often lowered by evaporation till they become
more salt than the sea; and it has happened, occasionally, that a considerable
precipitate of muriate of soda has taken place in these natural
salterns. During the latter part of Napoleon's career, when the excise
laws were enforced with extreme rigor, the police was employed to
prevent such salt from being used. The fluviatile and marine shells
inclosed in these small lakes often live together in brackish water; but
the uncongenial nature of the fluid usually produces a dwarfish size,
and sometimes gives rise to strange varieties in form and color.</p>

<p>Captain Smyth in his survey of the coast of the Mediterranean,
found the sea opposite the mouth of the Rhone, to deepen gradually
from four to forty fathoms, within a distance of six or seven miles,
over which the discolored fresh water extends; so that the inclination
of the new deposits must be too slight to be appreciable in such an
extent of section as a geologist usually obtains in examining ancient
formations. When the wind blew from the southwest, the ships employed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
in the survey were obliged to quit their moorings; and when
they returned, the new sand-banks in the delta were found covered
over with a great abundance of marine shells. By this means, we learn
how occasional beds of drifted marine shells may become interstratified
with freshwater strata at a river's mouth.</p>

<p><i>Stony nature of its deposits.</i>&mdash;That a great proportion, at least,
of the new deposit in the delta of the Rhone consists of <i>rock</i>, and not
of loose incoherent matter, is perfectly ascertained. In the Museum at
Montpelier is a cannon taken up from the sea near the mouth of the
river, imbedded in a crystalline calcareous rock. Large masses, also,
are continually taken up of an arenaceous rock, cemented by calcareous
matter, including multitudes of broken shells of recent species. The
observations lately made on this subject corroborate the former statement
of Marsilli, that the earthy deposits of the coast of Languedoc form
a stony substance, for which reason he ascribes a certain bituminous,
saline, and glutinous nature to the substances brought down with sand
by the Rhone.<a name="FNanchor_349" id="FNanchor_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a> If the number of mineral springs charged with carbonate
of lime which fall into the Rhone and its feeders in different
parts of France be considered, we shall feel no surprise at the lapidification
of the newly deposited sediment in this delta. It should be
remembered, that the fresh water introduced by rivers being lighter
than the water of the sea, floats over the latter, and remains upon the
surface for a considerable distance. Consequently it is exposed to
as much evaporation as the waters of a lake; and the area over which
the river-water is spread, at the junction of great rivers and the sea,
may well be compared, in point of extent, to that of considerable lakes.</p>

<p>Now, it is well known, that so great is the quantity of water carried
off by evaporation in some lakes, that it is nearly equal to the water
flowing in; and in some inland seas, as the Caspian, it is quite equal.
We may, therefore, well suppose that, in cases where a strong current
does not interfere, the greater portion not only of the matter held mechanically
in suspension, but of that also which is in chemical solution, may
be precipitated at no great distance from the shore. When these finer
ingredients are extremely small in quantity, they may only suffice to
supply crustaceous animals, corals, and marine plants, with the earthy
particles necessary for their secretions; but whenever it is in excess
(as generally happens if the basin of a river lie partly in a district of
active or extinct volcanoes), then will solid deposits be formed, and the
shells will at once be included in a rocky mass.</p>

<p><i>Coast of Asia Minor.</i>&mdash;Examples of the advance of the land upon
the sea are afforded by the southern coast of Asia Minor. Admiral
Sir F. Beaufort has pointed out in his survey the great alterations
effected since the time of Strabo, where havens are filled up, islands
joined to the mainland, and where the whole continent has increased
many miles in extent. Strabo himself, on comparing the outline of the
coast in his time with its ancient state, was convinced, like our countryman,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
that it had gained very considerably upon the sea. The new-formed
strata of Asia Minor consist <i>of stone</i>, not of loose incoherent
materials. Almost all the streamlets and rivers, like many of those in
Tuscany and the south of Italy, hold abundance of carbonate of lime
in solution, and precipitate travertin, or sometimes bind together the
sand and gravel into solid sandstones and conglomerates; every delta
and sand-bar thus acquires solidity, which often prevents streams from
forcing their way through them, so that their mouths are constantly
changing their position.<a name="FNanchor_350" id="FNanchor_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a></p>

<p><i>Delta of the Nile.</i>&mdash;That Egypt was "the gift of the Nile," was the
opinion of her priests before the time of Herodotus; and Rennell observes,
that the "configuration and composition of the low lands leave
no room for doubt that the sea once washed the base of the rocks on
which the pyramids of Memphis stand, the <i>present</i> base of which is
washed by the inundation of the Nile, at an elevation of 70 or 80 feet
above the Mediterranean. But when we attempt to carry back our ideas
to the remote period when the foundation of the delta was first laid, we
are lost in the contemplation of so vast an interval of time."<a name="FNanchor_351" id="FNanchor_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> Herodotus
observes, "that the country round Memphis seemed formerly to
have been an arm of the sea gradually filled by the Nile, in the same
manner as the Meander, Achelous, and other streams, had formed deltas.
Egypt, therefore, he says, like the Red Sea, was once a long narrow bay,
and both gulfs were separated by a small neck of land. If the Nile,
he adds, should by any means have an issue into the Arabian Gulf, it
might choke it up with earth in 20,000 or even, perhaps, in 10,000
years; and why may not the Nile have filled a still greater gulf with
mud in the space of time which has passed before our age?"<a name="FNanchor_352" id="FNanchor_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></p>

<p>The distance between Memphis and the most prominent part of the
delta in a straight line north and south, is about 100 geographical miles;
the length of the base of the delta is more than 200 miles if we follow
the coast between the ancient extreme eastern and western arms; but as
these are now blocked up, that part only of Lower Egypt which intervenes
between the Rosetta and Damietta branches, is usually called the
delta, the coast line of which is about 90 miles in length. The bed of
the river itself, says Sir J. G. Wilkinson, undergoes a gradual increase
of elevation varying in different places, and always lessening in proportion
as the river approaches the sea. "This increase of elevation in
perpendicular height is much smaller in Lower than in Upper Egypt,
and in the delta it diminishes still more; so that, according to an approximate
calculation, the land about Elephantine, or the first cataract,
lat. 24&deg; 5', has been raised nine feet in 1700 years; at Thebes, lat. 25&deg;
43', about seven feet; and at Heliopolis and Cairo, lat. 30&deg;, about five
feet ten inches. At Rosetta and the mouths of the Nile, lat. 31&deg; 30',
the diminution in the perpendicular thickness of the deposit is lessened
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
in a much greater decreasing ratio than in the straitened valley of Central
and Upper Egypt, owing to the great extent, east and west, over
which the inundation spreads."<a name="FNanchor_353" id="FNanchor_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<p>For this reason the alluvial deposit does not cause the delta to protrude
rapidly into the sea, although some ancient cities are now a mile or more
inland, and the mouths of the Nile, mentioned by the earlier geographers,
have been many of them silted up, and the outline of the coast entirely
changed.</p>

<p>The bed of the Nile always keeps pace with the general elevation of
the soil, and the banks of this river, like those of the Mississippi and its
tributaries (see p. <a href="#Page_265">265</a>, are much higher than the flat land at a distance,
so that they are seldom covered during the highest inundations. In
consequence of the gradual rise of the river's bed, the annual flood is
constantly spreading over a wider area, and the alluvial soil encroaches
on the desert, covering, to the depth of six or seven feet, the base of
statues and temples which the waters never reached 3000 years ago.
Although the sands of the Libyan deserts have in some places been
drifted into the valley of the Nile, yet these aggressions, says Wilkinson,
are far more than counterbalanced by the fertilizing effect of the water
which now reaches farther inland towards the desert, so that the number
of square miles of arable soil is greater at present than at any previous
period.</p>

<p><i>Mud of the Nile.</i>&mdash;On comparing the different analyses which have
been published of this mud, it will be found that it contains a large
quantity of argillaceous matter, with much peroxide of iron, some carbonate
of lime, and a small proportion of carbonate of magnesia. The
latest and most careful analysis by M. Lassaigne shows a singularly close
resemblance in the proportions of the ingredients of silica, alumina, iron,
carbon, lime, and magnesia, and those observed in ordinary mica;<a name="FNanchor_354" id="FNanchor_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a> but
a much larger quantity of calcareous matter is sometimes present.</p>

<p>In many places, as at Cairo, where artificial excavations have been
made, or where the river has undermined its banks, the mud is seen to
be thinly stratified, the upper part of each annual layer consisting of
earth of a lighter color than the lower, and the whole separating easily
from the deposit of the succeeding year. These annual layers are variable
in thickness; but, according to the calculations of Girard and Wilkinson,
the mean annual thickness of a layer at Cairo cannot exceed that
of a sheet of thin pasteboard, and a stratum of two or three feet must
represent the accumulation of a thousand years.</p>

<p>The depth of the Mediterranean is about twelve fathoms at a small
distance from the shore of the delta; it afterwards increases gradually to
50, and then suddenly descends to 380 fathoms, which is, perhaps, the
original depth of the sea where it has not been rendered shallower by
fluviatile matter. We learn from Lieut. Newbold that nothing but the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
finest and lightest ingredients reach the Mediterranean, where he has
observed the sea discolored by them to the distance of 40 miles from
the shore.<a name="FNanchor_355" id="FNanchor_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> The small progress of the delta in the last 2000 years affords,
perhaps, no measure for estimating its rate of growth when it was an
inland bay, and had not yet protruded itself beyond the coast-line of
the Mediterranean. A powerful current now sweeps along the shores
of Africa, from the Straits of Gibraltar to the prominent convexity of
Egypt, the western side of which is continually the prey of the waves;
so that not only are fresh accessions of land checked, but ancient parts
of the delta are carried away. By this cause, Canopus and some other
towns have been overwhelmed; but to this subject I shall again refer
when speaking of tides and currents.</p>

<p>In the last chapter several examples were given of the deltas of inland
seas, where the influence of the tides is almost imperceptible. We
may next consider those marine or oceanic deltas, where the tides play
an important part in the dispersion of fluviatile sediment, as in the Gulf
of Mexico, where they exert a moderate degree of force, and then in the
Bay of Bengal, where they are extremely powerful. In regard to
estuaries, which Rennel termed "negative deltas," they will be treated
of more properly when our attention is specially turned to the operations
of tides and currents (chapters 20, 21, and 22). In this case,
instead of the land gaining on the sea at the river's mouth, the tides
penetrate far inland beyond the general coast-line.</p>

<h6>BASIN AND DELTA OF THE MISSISSIPPI.</h6>

<p><i>Alluvial plain.</i>&mdash;The hydrographical basin of the Mississippi displays,
on the grandest scale, the action of running water on the surface of a
vast continent. This magnificent river rises nearly in the forty-ninth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
parallel of north latitude, and flows to the Gulf of Mexico in the twenty-ninth&mdash;a
course, including its meanders, of more than three thousand
miles. It passes from a cold climate, where the hunter obtains his furs
and peltries, traverses the temperate latitudes, and discharges its waters
into the sea in the region of rice, the cotton plant, and the sugar-cane.
From near its mouth at the Balize a steamboat may ascend for 2000
miles with scarcely any perceptible difference in the width of the river.
Several of its tributaries, the Red River, the Arkansas, the Missouri, the
Ohio, and others, would be regarded elsewhere as of the first importance,
and, taken together, are navigable for a distance many times exceeding
that of the main stream. No river affords a more striking illustration
of the law before mentioned, that an augmentation of volume does not
occasion a proportional increase of surface, nay, is even sometimes attended
with a narrowing of the channel. The Mississippi is half a mile
wide at its junction with the Missouri, the latter being also of equal
width; yet the united waters have only, from their confluence to the
mouth of the Ohio, a medial width of about half a mile. The junction
of the Ohio seems also to produce no increase, but rather a decrease,
of surface.<a name="FNanchor_356" id="FNanchor_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> The St. Francis, White, Arkansas, and Red rivers are
also absorbed by the main stream with scarcely any apparent increase
of its width, although here and there it expands to a breadth of 1&frac12;, or
even to 2 miles. On arriving at New Orleans, it is somewhat less than
half a mile wide. Its depth there is very variable, the greatest at high
water being 168 feet. The mean rate at which the whole body of
water flows is variously estimated; according to Mr. Forshey the mean
velocity of the current at the surface, somewhat exceeds 2-1/4 miles an
hour when the water is at a mean height. For 300 miles above New
Orleans the distance measured by the winding river is about twice as
great as the distance in a right line. For the first 100 miles from the
mouth the rate of fall is 1&middot;80 inch per mile, for the second hundred 2
inches, for the third 2&middot;30, for the fourth 2&middot;57.</p>

<p>The alluvial plain of the Mississippi begins to be of great width below
Cape Girardeau, 50 miles above the junction of the Ohio. At this
junction it is about 50 miles broad, south of which it contracts to about
30 miles at Memphis, expands again to 80 miles at the mouth of the
White River, and then, after various contractions and expansions, protrudes
beyond the general coast-line, in a large delta, about 90 miles in
width, from N. E. to S. W. Mr. Forshey estimates the area of the
great plain as above defined at 31,200 square miles, with a circumference
of about 3000 miles, exceeding the area of Ireland. If that part
of this plain which lies below, or to the south of the branching off of
the highest arm, called the Atchafalaya, be termed the delta, it constitutes
less than half of the whole, being 14,000 square British miles in
area. The delta may be said to be bounded on the east, west, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
south by the sea; on the north chiefly by the broad valley-plain which
entirely resembles it in character as in origin. The east and west
boundaries of the alluvial region above the head of the delta consists of
cliffs or bluffs, which on the east side of the Mississippi are very abrupt,
and are undermined by the river at many points. They consist, from
Baton Rouge in Louisiana, where they commence, as far north as the
borders of Kentucky, of geological formations newer than the cretaceous,
the lowest being Eocene, and the uppermost consisting of loam, resembling
the loess of the Rhine, and containing freshwater and land
shells almost all of existing species. (See <a href="#f23">fig. 23</a>.) These recent shells
are associated with the bones of the mastodon, elephant, tapir, mylodon,
horse, ox, and other quadrupeds, most of them of extinct species.</p>

<p>I have endeavored to show in my Second Visit to the United States,
that this extensive formation of loam is either an ancient alluvial plain
or a delta of the great river, formed originally at a lower level, and
since upheaved, and partially denuded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 23.<br />
<span class="smcap">Valley of the Mississippi.</span></span><a name="f23" id="f23"></a><img src="images/f23.png" width="550" height="132" alt="Modern alluvium of Mississippi." title="" />

<p class="center2">1. Modern alluvium of Mississippi.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Loam or Loess.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.<i>f</i>. Eocene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4. Cretaceous.</p></div>

<p>The Mississippi in that part of its course which is below the mouth
of the Ohio, frequently washes the eastern bluffs, but never once comes
in contact with the western. These are composed of similar formations;
but I learn from Mr. Forshey that they rise up more gently
from the alluvial plain (as at <i>a</i>, <a href="#f23">fig. 23</a>). It is supposed that the
waters are thrown to the eastern side, because all the large tributary
rivers entering from the west have filled that side of the great valley
with their deltas, or with a sloping mass of clay and sand; so that the
opposite bluffs are undermined, and the Mississippi is slowly but incessantly
advancing eastward.<a name="FNanchor_357" id="FNanchor_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a></p>

<p><i>Curves of the Mississippi.</i>&mdash;The river traverses the plain in a meandering
course, describing immense curves. After sweeping round the
half of a circle, it is carried in a rapid current diagonally across the
ordinary direction of its channel, to another curve of similar shape.
Opposite to each of these, there is always a sand-bar, answering, in the
convexity of its form, to the concavity of "the bend," as it is called.<a name="FNanchor_358" id="FNanchor_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>
The river, by continually wearing these curves deep, returns, like many
other streams before described, on its own track, so that a vessel in
some places, after sailing for twenty-five or thirty miles, is brought
round again to within a mile of the place whence it started. When the
waters approach so near to each other, it often happens at high floods
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
that they burst through the small tongue of land, and insulate a portion,
rushing through what is called the "cut-off," so that vessels may pass
from one point to another in half a mile to a distance which it previously
required a voyage of twenty miles to reach. As soon as the river
has excavated the new passage, bars of sand and mud are formed at
the two points of junction with the old bend, which is soon entirely
separated from the main river by a continuous mud-bank covered with
wood. The old bend then becomes a semicircular lake of clear water,
inhabited by large gar-fish, alligators, and wild fowl, which the steamboats
have nearly driven away from the main river. A multitude of
such crescent-shaped lakes, scattered far and wide over the alluvial
plain, the greater number of them to the west, but some of them also
eastward of the Mississippi, bear testimony of the extensive wanderings
of the great stream in former ages. For the last two hundred miles
above its mouth the course of the river is much less winding than
above, there being only in the whole of that distance one great curve,
that called the "English Turn." This great straightness of the stream
is ascribed by Mr. Forshey to the superior tenacity of the banks, which
are more clayey in this region.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><p class="center2">Fig. 24.</p><a name="f24" id="f24"></a><img src="images/f24.png" width="550" height="156" alt="Section of channel, bank, levees." title="" />

<p class="center2">Section of channel, bank, levees (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), and swamps of Mississippi river.</p></div>

<p>The Mississippi has been incorrectly described by some of the earlier
geographers, as a river running along the top of a long hill, or mound
in a plain. In reality it runs in a valley, from 100 to 200 or more feet
in depth, as <i>a</i>, <i>c</i>, <i>b</i>, <a href="#f24">fig. 24</a>, its banks forming long strips of land parallel
to the course of the main stream, and to the swamps <i>g</i>, <i>f</i>, and <i>d</i>, <i>e</i>,
lying on each side. These extensive morasses, which are commonly well-wooded,
though often submerged for months continuously, are rarely
more than fifteen feet below the summit level of the banks. The banks
themselves are occasionally overflowed, but are usually above water for
a breadth of about two miles. They follow all the curves of the great
river, and near New Orleans are raised artificially by embankments (or
levees), <i>a b</i>, <a href="#f24">fig. 24</a>, through which the river when swollen sometimes
cuts a deep channel (or crevasse), inundating the adjoining low lands
and swamps, and not sparing the lower streets of the great city.</p>

<p>The cause of the uniform upward slope of the river-bank above the
adjoining alluvial plain is this: when the waters charged with sediment
pass over the banks in the flood season, their velocity is checked among
the herbage and reeds, and they throw down at once the coarser and
more sandy matter with which they are charged. But the fine particles
of mud are carried farther on, so that at the distance of about two
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
miles, a thin film of fine clay only subsides, forming a stiff unctuous
black soil, which gradually envelops the base of trees growing on the
borders of the swamps.</p>

<p><i>Waste of the banks.</i>&mdash;It has been said of a mountain torrent, that "it
lays down what it will remove, and removes what it has laid down;"
and in like manner the Mississippi, by the continual shifting of its course,
sweeps away, during a great portion of the year, considerable tracts of
alluvium, which were gradually accumulated by the overflow of former
years, and the matter now left during the spring-floods will be at some
future time removed. After the flood season, when the river subsides
within its channel, it acts with destructive force upon the alluvial banks,
softened and diluted by the recent overflow. Several acres at a time,
thickly covered with wood, are precipitated into the stream; and large
portions of the islands are frequently swept away.</p>

<p>"Some years ago," observes Captain Hall, "when the Mississippi was
regularly surveyed, all its islands were numbered, from the confluence
of the Missouri to the sea; but every season makes such revolutions,
not only in the number, but in the magnitude and situation of these
islands, that this enumeration is now almost obsolete. Sometimes large
islands are entirely melted away; at other places they have attached
themselves to the main shore, or, which is the more correct statement,
the interval has been filled up by myriads of logs cemented together by
mud and rubbish."<a name="FNanchor_359" id="FNanchor_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p><i>Rafts.</i>&mdash;One of the most interesting features in the great rivers of this
part of America is the frequent accumulation of what are termed "rafts,"
or masses of floating trees, which have been arrested in their progress
by snags, islands, shoals, or other obstructions, and made to accumulate,
so as to form natural bridges, reaching entirely across the stream. One
of the largest of these was called the raft of the Atchafalaya, an arm of
the Mississippi, which was certainly at some former time the channel of
the Red River, when the latter found its way to the Gulf of Mexico by
a separate course. The Atchafalaya being in a direct line with the
general direction of the Mississippi, catches a large portion of the timber
annually brought down from the north; and the drift-trees collected in
about thirty-eight years previous to 1816 formed a continuous raft, no
less than ten miles in length, 220 yards wide, and eight feet deep. The
whole rose and fell with the water, yet was covered with green bushes
and trees, and its surface enlivened in the autumn by a variety of beautiful
flowers. It went on increasing till about 1835, when some of the
trees upon it had grown to the height of about sixty feet. Steps were
then taken by the State of Louisiana to clear away the whole raft, and
open the navigation, which was effected, not without great labor, in the
space of four years.</p>

<p>The rafts on Red River are equally remarkable: in some parts of its
course, cedar-trees are heaped up by themselves, and in other places,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
pines. On the rise of the waters in summer hundreds of these are seen,
some with their green leaves still upon them, just as they have fallen
from a neighboring bank, others leafless, broken and worn in their passage
from a far distant tributary: wherever they accumulate on the
edge of a sand-bar they arrest the current, and soon become covered
with sediment. On this mud the young willows and the poplars called
cotton-wood spring up, their boughs still farther retarding the stream,
and as the inundation rises, accelerating the deposition of new soil. The
bank continuing to enlarge, the channel at length becomes so narrow
that a single long tree may reach from side to side, and the remaining
space is then soon choked up by a quantity of other timber.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately for the navigation of the Mississippi," observes Captain
Hall, "some of the largest trunks, after being cast down from the
position on which they grew, get their roots entangled with the bottom
of the river, where they remain anchored, as it were, in the mud. The
force of the current naturally gives their tops a tendency downwards,
and, by its flowing past, soon strips them of their leaves and branches.
These fixtures, called snags, or planters, are extremely dangerous to the
steam-vessels proceeding up the stream, in which they lie like a lance
in rest, concealed beneath the water, with their sharp ends pointed
directly against the bows of the vessels coming up. For the most part
these formidable snags remain so still that they can be detected only by
a slight ripple above them, not perceptible to inexperienced eyes. Sometimes,
however, they vibrate up and down, alternately showing their
heads above the surface and bathing them beneath it."<a name="FNanchor_360" id="FNanchor_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> So imminent,
until lately, was the danger caused by these obstructions, that almost
all the boats on the Mississippi were constructed on a particular plan,
to guard against fatal accidents; but in the last ten years, by the aid
of the power of steam and the machinery of a snag-boat, as it is called,
the greater number of these trunks of trees have been drawn out of the
mud.<a name="FNanchor_361" id="FNanchor_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a></p>

<p>The prodigious quantity of wood annually drifted down by the Mississippi
and its tributaries, is a subject of geological interest, not merely
as illustrating the manner in which abundance of vegetable matter becomes,
in the ordinary course of nature, imbedded in submarine and estuary
deposits, but as attesting the constant destruction of soil and
transportation of matter to lower levels by the tendency of rivers to
shift their courses. Each of these trees must have required many years,
some of them centuries, to attain their full size; the soil, therefore,
whereon they grew, after remaining undisturbed for long periods, is
ultimately torn up and swept away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
It is also found in excavating at New Orleans, even at the depth of
several yards below the level of the sea, that the soil of the delta contains
innumerable trunks of trees, layer above layer, some prostrate, as
if drifted, others broken off near the bottom, but remaining still erect,
and with their roots spreading on all sides, as if in their natural position.
In such situations they appeared to me to indicate a sinking of the
ground, as the trees must formerly have grown in marshes above the
sea-level. In the higher parts of the alluvial plain, for many hundred
miles above the head of the delta, similar stools and roots of trees are
also seen buried in stiff clay at different levels, one above the other, and
exposed to view in the banks at low water. They point clearly to the
successive growth of forests in the extensive swamps of the plain, where
the ground was slowly raised, year after year, by the mud thrown down
during inundations. These roots and stools belong chiefly to the deciduous
cypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>), and other swamp-trees, and they
bear testimony to the constant shifting of the course of the great river,
which is always excavating land originally formed at some distance from
its banks.</p>

<p><i>Formation of lakes in Louisiana.</i>.&mdash;Another striking feature in the
basin of the Mississippi, illustrative of the changes now in progress, is
the formation by natural causes of great lakes, and the drainage of others.
These are especially frequent in the basin of the Red River in Louisiana,
where the largest of them, called Bistineau, is more than <i>thirty miles</i>
long, and has a medium depth of from <i>fifteen</i> to <i>twenty</i> feet. In the
deepest parts are seen numerous cypress-trees, of all sizes, now dead,
and most of them with their tops broken by the wind, yet standing
erect under water. This tree resists the action of air and water longer
than any other, and, if not submerged throughout the whole year, will
retain life for an extraordinary period. Lake Bistineau, as well as Black
Lake, Cado Lake, Spanish Lake, Natchitoches Lake, and many others,
have been formed, according to Darby, by the gradual elevation of the
bed of Red River, in which the alluvial accumulations have been so great
as to raise its channel, and cause its waters, during the flood season, to
flow up the mouths of many tributaries, and to convert parts of their
courses into lakes. In the autumn, when the level of Red River is again
depressed, the waters rush back, and some lakes become grassy meadows,
with streams meandering through them.<a name="FNanchor_362" id="FNanchor_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> Thus, there is a periodical
flux and reflux between Red River and some of these basins, which are
merely reservoirs, alternately emptied and filled, like our tide estuaries&mdash;with
this difference, that in the one case the land is submerged for several
months continuously, and in the other twice in every twenty-four
hours. It has happened, in several cases, that a raft of timber or a bar
has been thrown by Red River across some of the openings of these
channels, and then the lakes become, like Bistineau, constant repositories
of water. But, even in these cases, their level is liable to annual elevation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
and depression, because the flood of the main river, when at its
height, passes over the bar; just as, where sand-hills close the entrance
of an estuary on the Norfolk or Suffolk coast, the sea, during some high
tide or storm, has often breached the barrier and inundated again the
interior.</p>

<p>I am informed by Mr. Featherstonhaugh that the plains of the Red
River and the Arkansas are so low and flat, that whenever the Mississippi
rises thirty feet above its ordinary level, those great tributaries are
made to flow back, and inundate a region of vast extent. Both the
streams alluded to contain red sediment, derived from the decomposition
of red porphyry; and since 1833, when there was a great inundation in
the Arkansas, an immense swamp has been formed near the Mammelle
mountain, comprising 30,000 acres, with here and there large lagoons,
where the old bed of the river was situated; in which innumerable trees,
for the most part dead, are seen standing, of cypress, cotton-wood, or
poplar, the triple-thorned acacia, and others, which are of great size.
Their trunks appear as if painted red for about fifteen feet from the
ground; at which height a perfectly level line extends through the
whole forest, marking the rise of the waters during the last
flood.<a name="FNanchor_363" id="FNanchor_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a></p>

<p>But most probably the causes above assigned for the recent origin of
these lakes are not the only ones. Subterranean movements have altered,
so lately as the years 1811-12, the relative levels of various parts of
the basin of the Mississippi, situated 300 miles northeast of Lake Bistineau.
In those years the great valley, from the mouth of the Ohio to
that of the St. Francis, including a tract 300 miles in length, and exceeding
in area the whole basin of the Thames, was convulsed to such a degree,
as to create new islands in the river, and lakes in the alluvial plain.
Some of these were on the left or east bank of the Mississippi, and were
twenty miles in extent; as, for example, those named Reelfoot and Obion
in Tennessee, formed in the channels or valleys of small streams bearing
the same names.<a name="FNanchor_364" id="FNanchor_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a></p>

<p>But the largest area affected by the great convulsion lies eight or ten
miles to the westward of the Mississippi, and inland from the town of
New Madrid, in Missouri. It is called "the sunk country," and is said
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
to extend along the course of the White Water and its tributaries, for a
distance of between seventy and eighty miles north and south, and thirty
miles or more east and west. Throughout this area, innumerable submerged
trees, some standing leafless, others prostrate, are seen; and so
great is the extent of lake and marsh, that an active trade in the skins
of muskrats, mink, otters, and other wild animals, is now carried on
there. In March, 1846, I skirted the borders of the "sunk country"
nearest to New Madrid, passing along the Bayou St. John and Little
Prairie, where dead trees of various kinds, some erect in the water, others
fallen, and strewed in dense masses over the bottom, in the shallows, and
near the shore, were conspicuous. I also beheld countless rents in the
adjoining dry alluvial plains, caused by the movements of the soil in 1811-12,
and still open, though the rains, frost, and river inundations, have
greatly diminished their original depth. I observed, moreover, numerous
circular cavities, called "sunk holes," from ten to thirty yards wide,
and twenty feet or more in depth, which interrupt the general level of
the plain. These were formed by the spouting out of large quantities
of sand and mud during the earthquakes.<a name="FNanchor_365" id="FNanchor_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a></p>

<p>That the prevailing changes of level in the delta and alluvial plain of
the Mississippi have been caused by the subsidence, rather than the upheaval
of land, appears to me established by the fact, that there are no
protuberances of upraised alluvial soil, projecting above the level surface
of the great plain. It is true that the gradual elevation of that plain,
by new accessions of matter, would tend to efface every inequality derived
from this source, but we might certainly have expected to find
more broken ground between the opposite bluffs, had local upthrows of
alluvial strata been of repeated occurrence.</p>

<p><i>Antiquity of the delta.</i>&mdash;The vast size of the alluvial plain both above
and below the head of the delta, or the branching off of the uppermost
arm of the Atchafalaya, has been already alluded to. Its superficial
dimensions, according to Mr. Forshey, exceed 30,000 square miles,
nearly half of which belong to the true delta. The deposits consist
partly of sand originally formed upon or near the banks of the river, and
its tributaries, partly of gravel, swept down the main channel, of which
the position has continually shifted, and partly of fine mud slowly accumulated
in the swamps. The farther we descend the river towards
its mouth, the finer becomes the texture of the sediment. The whole
alluvial formation, from the base of the delta upwards, slopes with a
very gentle inclination, rising about three inches in a mile from the level
of the sea at the Balize, to the height of about 200 feet in a distance of
about 800 miles.</p>

<p>That a large portion of this fluviatile deposit, together with the fluvio-marine
strata now in progress near the Balize, consists of mud and sand
with much vegetable matter intermixed, may be inferred from what has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
been said of the abundance of drift trees floated down every summer.
These are seen matted together into a net-work around the extensive
mud banks at the extreme mouths of the river. Every one acquainted
with the geography of Louisiana is aware that the most southern part
of the delta forms a long narrow tongue of land protruding for 50 miles
into the Gulf of Mexico, at the end of which are numerous channels of
discharge. This singular promontory consists simply of the river and
its two low, flat banks, covered with reeds, young willows, and poplars.
Its appearance answers precisely to that of the banks far in the interior,
when nothing appears above water during inundations but the higher
part of the sloping glacis or bank. In the one case we have the swamps
or an expanse of freshwater with the tops of trees appearing above, in
the other the bluish green surface of the Gulf of Mexico. An opinion has
very commonly prevailed that this narrow promontory, the newest product
of the river, has gained very rapidly upon the sea, since the foundation
of New Orleans; but after visiting the Balize in 1846, in company
with Dr. Carpenter, and making many inquiries of the pilots, and comparing
the present outline of the coast with the excellent Spanish chart,
published by Charlevoix 120 years before, we came to a different conclusion.
The rate of permanent advance of the new land has been very
slow, not exceeding perhaps one mile in a century. The gain may have
been somewhat more rapid in former years, when the new strip of soil
projected less far into the gulf, since it is now much more exposed to
the action of a strong marine current. The tides also, when the waters
of the river are low, enter into each opening, and scour them out, destroying
the banks of mud and the sand-bars newly formed during the
flood season.</p>

<p>An observation of Darby, in regard to the strata composing part of
this delta, deserves attention. In the steep banks of the Atchafalaya,
before alluded to, the following section, he says, is observable at low
water:&mdash;first an upper stratum, consisting invariably of bluish clay,
common to the banks of the Mississippi; below this a stratum of red
ochreous earth, peculiar to Red River, under which the blue clay of the
Mississippi again appears; and this arrangement is constant, proving, as
that geographer remarks, that the waters of the Mississippi and the Red
River occupied alternately, at some former periods, considerable tracts
below their present point of union.<a name="FNanchor_366" id="FNanchor_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> Such alternations are probably
common in submarine spaces situated between two converging deltas;
for, before the two rivers unite, there must almost always be a certain
period when an intermediate tract will by turns be occupied and abandoned
by the waters of each stream; since it can rarely happen that
the season of highest flood will precisely correspond in each. In the
case of the Red River and Mississippi, which carry off the waters from
countries placed under widely distant latitudes, an exact coincidence in
the time of greatest inundation is very improbable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
The antiquity of the delta, or length of the period which has been
occupied in the deposition of so vast a mass of alluvial matter, is a
question which may well excite the curiosity of every geologist. Sufficient
data have not yet been obtained to afford a full and satisfactory
answer to the inquiry, but some approximation may already be made to
the minimum of time required.</p>

<p>When I visited New Orleans, in February, 1846, I found that Dr.
Riddell had made numerous experiments to ascertain the proportion of
sediment contained in the waters of the Mississippi; and he concluded
that the mean annual amount of solid matter was to the water as 1/1245
in weight, or about 1/3000 in volume.<a name="FNanchor_367" id="FNanchor_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> From the observations of the
same gentleman, and those of Dr. Carpenter and Mr. Forshey, an eminent
engineer, to whom I have before alluded, the average width, depth,
and velocity of the Mississippi, and thence the mean annual discharge
of water were deduced. I assumed 528 feet, or the tenth of a mile,
as the probable thickness of the deposit of mud and sand in the delta;
founding my conjecture chiefly on the depth of the Gulf of Mexico,
between the southern point of Florida and the Balize, which equals on
an average 100 fathoms, and partly on some borings 600 feet deep in
the delta, near Lake Pontchartrain, north of New Orleans, in which the
bottom of the alluvial matter is said not to have been reached. The
area of the delta being about 13,600 square statute miles, and the quantity
of solid matter annually brought down by the river 3,702,758,400
cubic feet, it must have taken 67,000 years for the formation of
the whole; and if the alluvial matter of the plain above be 264 feet
deep, or half that of the delta,<a name="FNanchor_368" id="FNanchor_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a> it must have required 33,500 more
years for its accumulation, even if its area be estimated as only equal
to that of the delta, whereas it is in fact larger. If some deduction be
made from the time here stated, in consequence of the effect of the
drift-wood, which must have aided in filling up more rapidly the space
above alluded to, a far more important allowance must be made on the
other hand, for the loss of matter, owing to the finer particles of mud
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
not settling at the mouths of the river, but being swept out far to sea
during the predominant action of the tides, and the waves in the winter
months, when the current of fresh water is feeble. Yet however vast
the time during which the Mississippi has been transporting its earthy
burden to the ocean, the whole period, though far exceeding, perhaps,
100,000 years, must be insignificant in a geological point of view, since
the bluffs or cliffs, bounding the great valley, and therefore older in
date, and which are from 50 to 250 feet in perpendicular height, consist
in great part of loam containing land, fluviatile, and lacustrine shells
of species still inhabiting the same country. (See <a href="#f23">fig. 23</a>, p. 265.)</p>

<p>Before we take leave of the great delta, we may derive an instructive
lesson from the reflection that the new deposits already formed, or
now accumulating, whether marine or freshwater, must greatly resemble
in composition, and the general character of their organic remains,
many ancient strata, which enter largely into the earth's structure.
Yet there is no sudden revolution in progress, whether on the land or
in the waters, whether in the animate or the inanimate world. Notwithstanding
the excessive destruction of soil and uprooting of trees,
the region which yields a never-failing supply of drift-wood is densely
clothed with noble forests, and is almost unrivalled in its power of supporting
animal and vegetable life. In spite of the undermining of many
a lofty bluff, and the encroachments of the delta on the sea&mdash;in spite
of the earthquake, which rends and fissures the soil, or causes areas
more than sixty miles in length to sink down several yards in a few
months, the general features of the district remain unaltered, or are
merely undergoing a slow and insensible change. Herds of wild deer
graze on the pastures, or browse upon the trees; and if they diminish
in number, it is only where they give way to man and the domestic
animals which follow in his train. The bear, the wolf, the fox, the
panther, and the wild-cat, still maintain themselves in the fastnesses of
the forests of cypress and gum-tree. The racoon and the opossum
are everywhere abundant, while the musk-rat, otter, and mink still
frequent the rivers and lakes, and a few beavers and buffaloes have not
yet been driven from their ancient haunts. The waters teem with aligators,
tortoises, and fish, and their surface is covered with millions of
migratory waterfowl, which perform their annual voyage between the
Canadian lakes and the shores of the Mexican Gulf. The power of
man begins to be sensibly felt, and many parts of the wilderness to be
replaced by towns, orchards, and gardens. The gilded steamboats, like
moving palaces, stem the force of the current, or shoot rapidly down
the descending stream, through the solitudes of the forests and prairies.
Already does the flourishing population of the great valley far
exceed that of the thirteen United States when first they declared their
independence. Such is the state of a continent where trees and stones
are hurried annually by a thousand torrents, from the mountains to the
plains, and where sand and finer matter are swept down by a vast current
to the sea, together with the wreck of countless forests and the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
bones of animals which perish in the inundations. When these materials
reach the gulf, they do not render the waters unfit for aquatic animals;
but on the contrary, the ocean here swarms with life, as it generally
does where the influx of a great river furnishes a copious supply
of organic and mineral matter. Yet many geologists, when they behold
the spoils of the land heaped in successive strata, and blended confusedly
with the remains of fishes, or interspersed with broken shells and
corals; when they see portions of erect trunks of trees with their roots
still retaining their natural position, and one tier of these preserved
in a fossil state above another, imagine that they are viewing the signs
of a turbulent instead of a tranquil and settled state of the planet.
They read in such phenomena the proof of chaotic disorder and reiterated
catastrophes, instead of indications of a surface as habitable as the
most delicious and fertile districts now tenanted by man.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><p class="center2">Fig. 25.<br /><br /></p><a name="f25" id="f25"></a><img src="images/f25.png" width="600" height="464" alt="Map of the Delta of the Ganges." title="" />

<p class="center2"><span class="smcap">Map of the Delta of the Ganges and Brahmapootra.</span></p></div>

<p>As an example of a still larger delta advancing upon the sea in opposition
to more powerful tides, I shall next describe that of the Ganges
and Brahmapootra (or Burrampooter). These, the two principal rivers
of India, descend from the highest mountains in the world, and partially
mingle their waters in the low plains of Hindostan, before reaching
the head of the Bay of Bengal. The Brahmapootra, somewhat the
larger of the two, formerly passed to the east of Dacca, even so lately
as the beginning of the present century, pouring most of its waters into
one of the numerous channels in the delta called "the Megna." By
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
that name the main stream was always spoken of by Rennell and others
in their memoirs on this region. But the main trunk now unites with
an arm of the Ganges considerably higher up, at a point about 100
miles distant from the sea; and it is constantly, according to Dr. Hooker,
working its way westward, having formerly, as may be seen by
ancient maps, moved eastward for a long period.</p>

<p>The area of the delta of the combined rivers, for it is impossible now
to distinguish what belongs to each, is considerably more than double
that of the Nile, even if we exclude from the delta a large extent of
low, flat, alluvial plain, doubtless of fluviatile origin, which stretches
more than 100 miles to the hills west of Calcutta (see map, <a href="#f25">fig. 25</a>),
and much farther in a northerly direction beyond the head of the great
delta. The head of a delta is that point where the first arm is given off.
Above that point a river receives the waters of tributaries flowing from
higher levels; below it, on the contrary, it gives out portions of its
waters to lower levels, through channels which flow into adjoining
swamps, or which run directly to the sea. The Mississippi, as before
described, has a single head, which originated at an unknown period
when the Red River joined it. In the great delta of Bengal there may
be said to be two heads nearly equidistant from the sea, that of the
Ganges (<span class="smcap">G</span>, map, <a href="#f25">fig. 25</a>), about 30 miles below Rajmahal, or 216 statute
miles in a direct line from the sea, and that of the Brahmapootra
(<span class="smcap">B</span>), below Chirapoonjee, where the river issues from the Khasia mountains,
a distance of 224 miles from the Bay of Bengal.</p>

<p>It will appear, by reference to the map, that the great body of fresh
water derived from the two rivers enters the bay on its eastern side;
and that a large part of the delta bordering on the sea is composed of
a labyrinth of rivers and creeks, all filled with salt water, except those
immediately communicating with the Hoogly, or principal arm of the
Ganges. This tract alone, known by the name of the Woods, or Sunderbunds
(more properly Soonderbuns), a wilderness infested by tigers
and crocodiles, is, according to Rennell, equal in extent to the whole
principality of Wales.<a name="FNanchor_369" id="FNanchor_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a></p>

<p>On the sea-coast there are eight great openings, each of which has
evidently, at some ancient period, served in its turn as the principal
channel of discharge. Although the flux and reflux of the tide extend
even to the heads of the delta when the rivers are low, yet, when they
are periodically swollen by tropical rains, their volume and velocity
counteract the tidal current, so that, except very near the sea, the ebb
and flow become insensible. During the flood season, therefore, the
Ganges and Brahmapootra almost assume in their delta, the character of
rivers entering an inland sea; the movements of the ocean being then
subordinate to the force of the rivers, and only slightly disturbing their
operations. The great gain of the delta in height and area takes place
during the inundations; and, during other seasons of the year, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
ocean makes reprisals, scouring out the channels, and sometimes devouring
rich alluvial plains.</p>

<p><i>Islands formed and destroyed.</i>&mdash;Major R. H. Colebrooke, in his
account of the course of the Ganges, relates examples of the rapid
filling up of some of its branches, and the excavation of new channels,
where the number of square miles of soil removed in a short time (the
column of earth being 114 feet high) was truly astonishing. Forty
square miles, or 25,600 acres, are mentioned as having been carried
away, in one place, in the course of a few years.<a name="FNanchor_370" id="FNanchor_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> The immense transportation
of earthy matter by the Ganges and Brahmapootra is proved
by the great magnitude of the islands formed in their channels during
a period far short of that of a man's life. Some of these, many miles
in extent, have originated in large sand-banks thrown up round the
points at the angular turning of the rivers, and afterwards insulated
by breaches of the streams. Others, formed in the main channel,
are caused by some obstruction at the bottom. A large tree, or a
sunken boat, is sometimes sufficient to check the current, and cause a
deposit of sand, which accumulates till it usurps a considerable portion
of the channel. The river then undermines its banks on each side, to
supply the deficiency in its bed, and the island is afterwards raised by
fresh deposits during every flood. In the great gulf below Luckipour,
formed by the united waters of the Ganges and Megna, some of the
islands, says Rennell, rival in size and fertility the Isle of Wight.
While the river is forming new islands in one part, it is sweeping away
old ones in others. Those newly formed are soon overrun with reeds,
long grass, the Tamarix Indica, and other shrubs, forming impenetrable
thickets, where the tiger, the rhinoceros, the buffalo, deer, and other
wild animals, take shelter. It is easy, therefore, to perceive, that both
animal and vegetable remains may occasionally be precipitated into the
flood, and become imbedded in the sediment which subsides in the delta.</p>

<p>Three or four species of crocodile, of two distinct sub-genera, abound
in the Ganges, and its tributary and contiguous waters; and Mr. H. T.
Colebrooke informed me, that he had seen both forms in places far
inland, many hundred miles from the sea. The Gangetic crocodile, or
Gavial (in correct orthography, Garial), is confined to the fresh water,
living exclusively on fish, but the commoner kinds, called Koomiah and
Muggar, frequent both fresh and salt, being much larger and fiercer in
salt and brackish water.<a name="FNanchor_371" id="FNanchor_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a> These animals swarm in the brackish water
along the line of sand-banks, where the advance of the delta is most
rapid. Hundreds of them are seen together in the creeks of the delta,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
or basking in the sun on the shoals without. They will attack men
and cattle, destroying the natives when bathing, and tame and wild
animals which come to drink. "I have not unfrequently," says Mr.
Colebrooke, "been witness to the horrid spectacle of a floating corpse
seized by a crocodile with such avidity, that he half emerged above the
water with his prey in his mouth." The geologist will not fail to observe
how peculiarly the habits and distribution of these saurians expose
them to become imbedded in the horizontal strata of fine mud, which
are annually deposited over many hundred square miles in the Bay of
Bengal. The inhabitants of the land, which happen to be drowned or
thrown into the water, are usually devoured by these voracious reptiles;
but we may suppose the remains of the saurians themselves to be continually
entombed in the new formations. The number, also, of bodies
of the poorer class of Hindoos thrown annually into the Ganges is so
great, that some of their bones or skeletons can hardly fail to be occasionally
enveloped in fluviatile mud.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, at the season when the periodical flood is at
its height, that a strong gale of wind, conspiring with a high springtide,
checks the descending current of the river, and gives rise to most
destructive inundations. From this cause, in 1763, the waters at Luckipour
rose six feet above their ordinary level, and the inhabitants of a considerable
district, with their houses and cattle, were totally swept away.</p>

<p>The population of all oceanic deltas are particularly exposed to suffer
by such catastrophes, recurring at considerable intervals of time; and
we may safely assume that such tragical events have happened again
and again since the Gangetic delta was inhabited by man. If human
experience and forethought cannot always guard against these calamities,
still less can the inferior animals avoid them; and the monuments
of such disastrous inundations must be looked for in great abundance in
strata of all ages, if the surface of our planet has always been governed
by the same laws. When we reflect on the general order and tranquillity
that reigns in the rich and populous delta of Bengal, notwithstanding
the havoc occasionally committed by the depredations of the ocean,
we perceive how unnecessary it is to attribute the imbedding of successive
races of animals in older strata to extraordinary energy in the
causes of decay and reproduction in the infancy of our planet, or to those
general catastrophes and sudden revolutions so often resorted to.</p>

<p><i>Deposits in the delta.</i>&mdash;The quantity of mud held in suspension by
the waters of the Ganges and Brahmapootra is found, as might be expected,
to exceed that of any of the rivers alluded to in this or the preceding
chapters; for, in the first place, their feeders flow from mountains
of unrivalled altitude, and do not clear themselves in any lakes,
as does the Rhine in the Lake of Constance, or the Rhone in that of Geneva.
And, secondly, their whole course is nearer the equator than that
of the Mississippi, or any great river, respecting which careful experiments
have been made, to determine the quantity of its water and
earthy contents. The fall of rain, moreover, as we have before seen, is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
excessive on the southern flanks of the first range of mountains which
rise from the plains of Hindostan, and still more remarkable is the quantity
sometimes poured down in one day. (See above, p. 200.) The
sea, where the Ganges and Brahmapootra discharge their main stream at
the flood season, only recovers its transparency at the distance of from
60 to 100 miles from the delta; and we may take for granted that the
current continues to transport the finer particles much farther south
than where the surface water first becomes clear. The general slope,
therefore, of the new strata must be extremely gentle. According to
the best charts, there is a gradual deepening from four to about sixty
fathoms, as we proceed from the base of the delta to the distance of
about one hundred miles into the Bay of Bengal. At some few points
seventy, or even one hundred, fathoms are obtained at that distance.</p>

<p>One remarkable exception, however, occurs to the regularity of the
shape of the bottom. Opposite the middle of the delta, at the distance
of thirty or forty miles from the coast, a deep submarine valley occurs,
called the "swatch of no ground," about fifteen miles in diameter,
where soundings of 180, and even 300, fathoms fail to reach the
bottom. (See map, p. 275.) This phenomenon is the more extraordinary,
since the depression runs north to within five miles of the line of
shoals; and not only do the waters charged with sediment pass over
it continually, but, during the monsoons, the sea, loaded with mud and
sand, is beaten back in that direction towards the delta. As the mud
is known to extend for eighty miles farther into the gulf, an enormous
thickness of matter must have been deposited in "the swatch." We
may conclude, therefore, either that the original depth of this part of
the Bay of Bengal was excessive, or that subsidences have occurred in
modern times. The latter conjecture is the less improbable, as the
whole area of the delta has been convulsed in the historical era by
earthquakes, and actual subsidences have taken place in the neighboring
coast of Chittagong, while "the swatch" lies not far from the volcanic
band which connects Sumatra, Barren Island, and Ramree.<a name="FNanchor_372" id="FNanchor_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a></p>

<p>Opposite the mouth of the Hoogly river, and immediately south of
Saugor Island, four miles from the nearest land of the delta, a new islet
was formed about twenty years ago, called Edmonstone Island, on the
centre of which a beacon was erected as a landmark in 1817. In 1818
the island had become two miles long and half a mile broad, and was
covered with vegetation and shrubs. Some houses were then built upon
it, and in 1820 it was used as a pilot station. The severe gale of 1823
divided it into two parts, and so reduced its size as to leave the beacon
standing out in the sea, where, after remaining seven years, it was washed
away. The islet in 1836 had been converted by successive storms into
a sand-bank, half a mile long, on which a sea-mark was placed.</p>

<p>Although there is evidence of gain at some points, the general progress
of the coast is very slow; for the tides, when the river water is
low, are actively employed in removing alluvial matter. In the Sunderbunds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
the usual rise and fall of the tides is no more than eight feet,
but, on the east side of the delta, Dr. Hooker observed, in the winter of
1851, a rise of from sixty to eighty feet, producing among the islands at
the mouths of the Megna and Fenny rivers, a lofty wave or "bore" as
they ascend, and causing the river water to be ponded back, and then
to sweep down with great violence when the tide ebbs. The bay for
forty miles south of Chittagong is so fresh that neither alg&aelig; nor mangroves
will grow in it. We may, therefore, conceive how effective may
be the current formed by so great a volume of water in dispersing fine
mud over a wide area. Its power is sometimes augmented by the
agitation of the bay during hurricanes in the month of May. The new
superficial strata consists entirely of fine sand and mud; such, at least,
are the only materials which are exposed to view in regular beds on the
banks of the numerous creeks. Neither here or higher up the Ganges,
could Dr. Hooker discover any land or freshwater shells in sections of
the banks, which in the plains higher up sometimes form cliffs eighty
feet in height at low water. In like manner I have stated<a name="FNanchor_373" id="FNanchor_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a> that I was
unable to find any buried shells in the delta or modern river cliffs of
the Mississippi.</p>

<p>No substance so coarse as gravel occurs in any part of the delta of
the Ganges and Brahmapootra, nor nearer the sea than 400 miles. Yet
it is remarkable that the boring of an Artesian well at Fort William,
near Calcutta, in the years 1835-1840, displayed, at the depth of 120
feet, clay and sand with pebbles. This boring was carried to a depth
of 481 feet below the level of Calcutta, and the geological section obtained
in the operation has been recorded with great care. Under the
surface soil, at a depth of about ten feet, they came to a stiff blue clay
about forty feet in thickness; below which was sandy clay, containing
in its lower portion abundance of decayed vegetable matter, which at
the bottom assumed the character of a stratum of black peat two feet
thick. This peaty mass was considered as a clear indication (like the
"dirt-bed" of Portland) of an ancient terrestrial surface, with a forest
or Sunderbund vegetation. Logs and branches of a red-colored wood
occur both above and immediately below the peat, so little altered that
Dr. Wallich was able to identify them with the Soondri tree, <i>Heritiera
littoralis</i>, one of the most prevalent forms, at the base of the delta. Dr.
Falconer tells me that similar peat has been met with at other points
round Calcutta at the depth of nine feet and twenty-five feet. It
appears, therefore, that there has been a sinking down of what was
originally land in this region, to the amount of seventy feet or more perpendicular;
for Calcutta is only a few feet above the level of the sea,
and the successive peat-beds seem to imply that the subsidence of the
ground was gradual or interrupted by several pauses. Below the vegetable
mass they entered upon a stratum of yellowish clay about ten feet
thick, containing horizontal layers of kunkar (or kankar), a nodular, concretionary,
argillaceous limestone, met with abundantly at greater or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
less depths in all parts of the valley of the Ganges, over many thousand
square miles, and always presenting the same characters, even at a distance
of one thousand miles north of Calcutta. Some of this kunkar is
said to be of very recent origin in deposits formed by river inundations
near Saharanpoor. After penetrating 120 feet, they found loam containing
water-worn fragments of mica-slate and other kinds of rock,
which the current of the Ganges can no longer transport to this region.
In the various beds pierced through below, consisting of clay, marl,
and friable sandstone, with kunkar here and there intermixed, no organic
remains of decidedly marine origin were met with. Too positive a conclusion
ought not, it is true, to be drawn from such a fact, when we
consider the narrow bore of the auger and its effect in crushing shells
and bones. Nevertheless, it is worthy of remark, that the only fossils
obtained in a recognizable state were of a fluviatile or terrestrial character.
Thus, at the depth of 350 feet, the bony shell of a tortoise, or
trionyx, a freshwater genus, was found in sand, resembling the living
species of Bengal. From the same stratum, also, they drew up the lower
half of the humerus of a ruminant, at first referred to a hy&aelig;na. It was
the size and shape, says Dr. Falconer, of the shoulder-bone of the <i>Cervus
porcinus</i>, or common hog-deer, of India. At the depth of 380 feet,
clay with fragments of lacustrine shells was incumbent on what appears
clearly to have been another "dirt-bed," or stratum of decayed wood,
implying a period of repose of some duration, and a forest-covered land,
which must have subsided 300 feet, to admit of the subsequent superposition
of the overlying deposits. It has been conjectured that, at
the time when this area supported trees, the land extended much farther
out into the Bay of Bengal than now, and that in later times the
Ganges, while enlarging its delta, has been only recovering lost ground
from the sea.</p>

<p>At the depth of about 400 feet below the surface, an abrupt change
was observed in the character of the strata, which were composed in
great part of sand, shingle, and boulders, the only fossils observed being
the vertebr&aelig; of a crocodile, shell of a trionyx, and fragments of wood
very little altered, and similar to that buried in beds far above. These
gravelly beds constituted the bottom of the section at the depth of 481
feet, when the operations were discontinued, in consequence of an accident
which happened to the auger.</p>

<p>The occurrence of pebbles at the depths of 120 and 400 feet implies
an important change in the geographical condition of the region around
or near Calcutta. The fall of the river, or the general slope of the alluvial
plain may have been formerly greater; or, before a general and perhaps
unequal subsidence, hills once nearer the present base of the delta
may have risen several hundred feet, forming islands in the bay, which
may have sunk gradually, and become buried under fluviatile sediment.</p>

<p><i>Antiquity of the delta.</i>&mdash;It would be a matter of no small scientific interest,
if experiments were made to enable us to determine, with some
degree of accuracy, the mean quantity of earthy matter discharged
annually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
into the sea by the united waters of the Ganges and Brahmapootra.
The Rev. Mr. Everest instituted, in 1831-2, a series of observations
on the earthy matter brought down by the Ganges, at Ghazepoor,
500 miles from the sea. He found that, in 1831, the number of cubic
feet of water discharged by the river per second at that place was,
during the</p>

<table width="70%" summary="water discharged">
<tr>
<td class="t80">Rains (4 months)</td>
<td class="t20b">494,208</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="t80">Winter (5 months)</td>
<td class="t20b">71,200</td>
</tr><tr>
<td class="t80">Hot weather (3 months)</td>
<td class="t20b">36,330</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>so that we may state in round numbers that 500,000 cubic feet per
second flow down during the four months of the flood season, from
June to September, and less than 60,000 per second during the remaining
eight months.</p>

<p>The average quantity of solid matter suspended in the water during
the rains was, by weight, 1/428th part; but as the water is about one-half
the specific gravity of the dried mud, the solid matter discharged is
1/856th part in bulk, or 577 cubic feet per second. This gives a total of
6,082,041,600 cubic feet for the discharge in the 122 days of the rain.
The proportion of sediment in the waters at other seasons was comparatively
insignificant, the total amount during the five winter months being
only 247,881,600 cubic feet, and during the three months of hot weather
38,154,240 cubic feet. The total annual discharge, then, would be
6,368,077,440 cubic feet.</p>

<p>This quantity of mud would in one year raise a surface of 228&frac12;
square miles, or a square space, each side of which should measure 15
miles, a height of one foot. To give some idea of the magnitude of this
result, we will assume that the specific gravity of the dried mud is only
one-half that of granite (it would, however, be more); in that case, the
earthy matter discharged in a year would equal 3,184,038,720 cubic
feet of granite. Now about 12&frac12; cubic feet of granite weigh one ton;
and it is computed that the great Pyramid of Egypt, if it were a solid
mass of granite, would weigh about 600,000,000 tons. The mass of
matter, therefore, carried down annually would, according to this estimate,
more than equal in weight and bulk forty-two of the great pyramids
of Egypt, and that borne down in the four months of the rains
would equal forty pyramids. But if, without any conjecture as to what
may have been the specific gravity of the mud, we attend merely to the
weight of solid matter actually proved by Mr. Everest to have been
contained in the water, we find that the number of tons weight which
passed down in the 122 days of the rainy season was 339,413,760,
which would give the weight of fifty-six pyramids and a half; and in
the whole year 355,361,464 tons, or nearly the weight of sixty pyramids.</p>

<p>The base of the great Pyramid of Egypt covers eleven acres, and its
perpendicular height is about five hundred feet. It is scarcely possible
to present any picture to the mind which will convey an adequate conception
of the mighty scale of this operation, so tranquilly and almost
insensibly carried on by the Ganges, as it glides through its alluvial
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
plain, even at a distance of 500 miles from the sea. It may, however,
be stated, that if a fleet of more than eighty Indiamen, each freighted
with about 1400 tons' weight of mud, were to sail down the river every
hour of every day and night for four months continuously, they would
only transport from the higher country to the sea a mass of solid matter
equal to that borne down by the Ganges, even in this part of its course,
in the four months of the flood season. Or the exertions of a fleet of
about 2000 such ships going down daily with the same burden, and
discharging it into the gulf, would be no more than equivalent to the
operations of the great river.</p>

<p>The most voluminous current of lava which has flowed from Etna
within historical times was that of 1669. Ferrara, after correcting
Borelli's estimate, calculated the quantity of cubic yards of lava in this
current at 140,000,000. Now, this would not equal in bulk one-fifth
of the sedimentary matter which is carried down in a single year by the
Ganges, past Ghazepoor, according to the estimate above explained; so
that it would require five grand eruptions of Etna to transfer a mass of
lava from the subterranean regions to the surface, equal in volume to
the mud carried down in one year to that place.</p>

<p>Captain R. Strachey, of the Bengal Engineers, has remarked to me,
not only that Ghazepoor, where Mr. Everest's observations were made,
is 500 miles from the sea, but that the Ganges has not been joined there
by its most important feeders. These drain upon the whole 750 miles
of the Himalaya, and no more than 150 miles of that mountain-chain
have sent their contributions to the main trunk at Ghazepoor. Below
that place, the Ganges is joined by the Gogra, Gunduk, Khosee, and
Teesta from the north, to say nothing of the Sone flowing from the
south, one of the largest of the rivers which rise in the table-land of
central India. (See map, <a href="#f25">fig. 25</a>, p. 275.) Moreover the remaining 600
miles of the Himalaya comprise that eastern portion of the basin where
the rains are heaviest. (See above, p. 200.) The quantity of water
therefore carried down to the sea may probably be four or five times as
much as that which passes Ghazepoor.</p>

<p>The Brahmapootra, according to Major Wilcox,<a name="FNanchor_374" id="FNanchor_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a> in the month of
January, when it is near its minimum, discharges 150,000 cubic feet of
water per second at Gwalpara, not many miles above the head of its
delta. Taking the proportions observed at Ghazepoor at the different
seasons as a guide, the probable average discharge of the Brahmapootra
for the whole year may be estimated at about the same as that of the
Ganges. Assuming this; and secondly, in order to avoid the risk of
exaggeration, that the proportion of sediment in their waters is about a
third less than Mr. Everest's estimate, the mud borne down to the Bay
of Bengal in one year would equal 40,000 millions of cubic feet, or between
six and seven times as much as that brought down to Ghazepoor,
according to Mr. Everest's calculations in 1831, and ten times as much
as that conveyed annually by the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
Captain Strachey estimates the annually inundated portion of the
delta at 250 miles in length by 80 in breadth, making an area of 20,000
square miles. The space south of this in the bay, where sediment is
thrown down, may be 300 miles from E. to W. by 150 N. and S., or
45,000 square miles, which, added to the former, gives a surface of
65,000 square miles, over which the sediment is spread out by the two
rivers. Suppose then the solid matter to amount to 40,000 millions of
cubic feet per annum, the deposit, he observes, must be continued for
forty-five years and three-tenths to raise the whole area a height of one
foot, or 13,600 years to raise it 300 feet; and this, as we have seen, is
much less than the thickness of the fluviatile strata actually penetrated,
(and the bottom not reached) by the auger at Calcutta.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we can by no means deduce from these data alone, what
will be the future rate of advance of the delta, nor even predict whether
the land will gain on the sea, or remain stationary. At the end of
13,000 years the bay may be less shallow than now, provided a moderate
depression, corresponding to that experienced in part of Greenland
for many centuries shall take place (see chap. 30). A subsidence quite
insensible to the inhabitants of Bengal, not exceeding two feet three
inches in a century, would be more than sufficient to counterbalance all
the efforts of the two mighty rivers to extend the limits of their delta.
We have seen that the Artesian borings at Calcutta attest, what the vast
depth of the "swatch" may also in all likelihood indicate, that the antagonist
force of subsidence has predominated for ages over the influx of
fluviatile mud, preventing it from raising the plains of Bengal, or from
filling up a larger portion of the bay.</p>

<h6>CONCLUDING REMARKS ON DELTAS.</h6>

<p><i>Convergence of deltas.</i>&mdash;If we possessed an accurate series of maps
of the Adriatic for many thousand years, our retrospect would, without
doubt, carry us gradually back to the time when the number of rivers
descending from the mountains into that gulf by independent deltas was
far greater in number. The deltas of the Po and the Adige, for instance,
would separate themselves within the <i>recent</i> era, as, in all probability,
would those of the Isonzo and the Torre. If, on the other hand, we
speculate on future changes, we may anticipate the period when the
number of deltas will greatly diminish; for the Po cannot continue to
encroach at the rate of a mile in a hundred years, and other rivers to
gain as much in six or seven centuries upon the shallow gulf, without
new junctions occurring from time to time; so that Eridanus, "the king
of rivers," will continually boast a greater number of tributaries. The
Ganges and the Brahmapootra have perhaps become partially confluent
in the same delta within the historical, or at least within the human era;
and the date of the junction of the Red River and the Mississippi would,
in all likelihood, have been known, if America had not been so recently
discovered. The union of the Tigris and the Euphrates must undoubtedly
have been one of the modern geographical changes of our Earth,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
for Col. Rawlinson informs me that the delta of those rivers has advanced
two miles in the last sixty years, and is supposed to have encroached
about forty miles upon the Gulf of Persia in the course of the last twenty-five
centuries.</p>

<p>When the deltas of rivers, having many mouths, converge, a partial
union at first takes place by the confluence of some one or more of their
arms; but it is not until the main trunks are connected above the head
of the common delta, that a complete intermixture of their joint waters
and sediment takes place. The union, therefore, of the Po and Adige,
and of the Ganges and Brahmapootra, is still incomplete. If we reflect
on the geographical extent of surface drained by rivers such as now enter
the Bay of Bengal, and then consider how complete the blending
together of the greater part of their transported matter has already become,
and throughout how vast a delta it is spread by numerous arms,
we no longer feel so much surprise at the area occupied by some ancient
formations of homogeneous mineral composition. But our surprise will
be still farther lessened, when we afterwards inquire (ch. 21) into the
action of tides and currents in disseminating sediment.</p>

<p><i>Age of existing deltas.</i>&mdash;If we could take for granted, that the relative
level of land and sea had remained stationary ever since all the existing
deltas began to be formed&mdash;could we assume that their growth
commenced at one and the same instant when the present continents
acquired their actual shape&mdash;we might understand the language of
geologists who speak of "the epoch of existing continents." They endeavor
to calculate the age of deltas from this imaginary fixed period;
and they calculate the gain of new land upon the sea, at the mouths of
rivers, as having begun everywhere simultaneously. But the more we
study the history of deltas, the more we become convinced that upward
and downward movements of the land and contiguous bed of the sea
have exerted, and continue to exert, an influence on the physical geography
of many hydrographical basins, on a scale comparable in magnitude
or importance to the amount of fluviatile deposition effected in an
equal lapse of time. In the basin of the Mississippi, for example, proofs
both of descending and ascending movements to a vertical amount of
several hundred feet can be shown to have taken place since the existing
species of land and freshwater shells lived in that region.<a name="FNanchor_375" id="FNanchor_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a></p>

<p>The deltas also of the Po and Ganges have each, as we have seen (p.
257), when probed by the Artesian auger, borne testimony to a gradual
subsidence of land to the extent of several hundred feet&mdash;old terrestrial
surfaces, turf, peat, forest-land, and "dirt-beds," having been pierced at
various depths. The changes of level at the mouth of the Indus in
Cutch (see below, chap. <a href="#Page_451">27</a>), and those of New Madrid in the valley of
the Mississippi (see p. <a href="#Page_270">270</a>, and chap. <a href="#Page_451">27</a>), are equally instructive, as
demonstrating unceasing fluctuations in the levels of those areas into
which running water is transporting sediment. If, therefore, the exact
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
age of all modern deltas could be known, it is scarcely probable that
we should find any two of them in the world to have coincided in date,
or in the time when their earliest deposits originated.</p>

<p><i>Grouping of strata in deltas.</i>&mdash;The changes which have taken place
in deltas, even within the times of history, may suggest many important
considerations in regard to the manner in which subaqueous sediment is
distributed. With the exception of some cases hereafter to be noticed,
there are some general laws of arrangement which must evidently hold
good in almost all the lakes and seas now filling up. If a lake, for example,
be encircled on two sides by lofty mountains, receiving from
them many rivers and torrents of different sizes, and if it be bounded
on the other sides, where the surplus waters issue, by a comparatively
low country, it is not difficult to define some of the leading geological
features which must characterize the lacustrine formation, when this
basin shall have been gradually converted into dry land by the influx of
sediment. The strata would be divisible into two principal groups: the
<i>older</i> comprising those deposits which originated on the side adjoining
the mountains, where numerous deltas first began to form; and the
<i>newer</i> group consisting of beds deposited in the more central parts of
the basin, and towards the side farthest from the mountains. The following
characters would form the principal marks of distinction between
the strata in each series:&mdash;The more ancient system would be composed,
for the most part, of coarser materials, containing many beds of pebbles
and sand, often of great thickness, and sometimes dipping at a considerable
angle. These, with associated beds of finer ingredients, would, if
traced round the borders of the basin, be seen to vary greatly in color
and mineral composition, and would also be very irregular in thickness.
The beds, on the contrary, in the newer group, would consist of finer
particles, and would be horizontal, or very slightly inclined. Their
color and mineral composition would be very homogeneous throughout
large areas, and would differ from almost all the separate beds in the
older series.</p>

<p>The following causes would produce the diversity here alluded to between
the two great members of such lacustrine formations:&mdash;When
the rivers and torrents first reach the edge of the lake, the detritus
washed down by them from the adjoining heights sinks at once into
deep water, all the heavier pebbles and sand subsiding near the shore.
The finer mud is carried somewhat farther out, but not to the distance
of many miles, for the greater part may be seen, as, for example, where
the Rhone enters the Lake of Geneva, to fall down in clouds to the
bottom, not far from the river's mouth. Thus alluvial tracts are soon
formed at the mouths of every torrent and river, and many of these in
the course of ages become of considerable extent. Pebbles and sand
are then transported farther from the mountains; but in their passage
they decrease in size by attrition, and are in part converted into mud
and sand. At length some of the numerous deltas, which are all directed
towards a common centre, approach near to each other; those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
of adjoining torrents become united, and each is merged, in its turn, in
the delta of the largest river, which advances most rapidly into the lake,
and renders all the minor streams, one after the other, its tributaries.
The various mineral ingredients of all are thus blended together into
one homogeneous mixture, and the sediment is poured out from a common
channel into the lake.</p>

<p>As the average size of the transported particles decreases, while the
force and volume of the main river augments, the newer deposits are
diffused continually over a wider area, and are consequently more horizontal
than the older. When at first there were many independent
deltas near the borders of the basin, their separate deposits differed entirely
from each other; one may have been charged, like the Arve
where it joins the Rhone, with white sand and sediment derived from
granite&mdash;another may have been black, like many streams in the Tyrol,
flowing from the waste of decomposing rocks of dark slate&mdash;a third
may have been colored by ochreous sediment, like the Red River in
Louisiana&mdash;a fourth, like the Elsa in Tuscany, may have held much
carbonate of lime in solution. At first they would each form distinct
deposits of sand, gravel, limestone, marl, or other materials; but, after
their junction, new chemical combinations and a distinct color would be
the result, and the particles, having been conveyed ten, twenty, or a
greater number of miles over alluvial plains, would become finer.</p>

<p>In those deltas where the tides and strong marine currents interfere,
the above description would only be applicable, with certain modifications.
If a series of earthquakes accompany the growth of a delta, and
change the levels of the land from time to time, as in the region where
the Indus now enters the sea, the phenomena will depart still more
widely from the ordinary type. If, after a protracted period of rest, a
delta sinks down, pebbles may be borne along in shallow water near the
foot of the boundary hills, so as to form conglomerates overlying the
fine mud previously thrown into deeper water in the same area.</p>

<p><i>Causes of stratification in deltas.</i>&mdash;The stratified arrangement, which
is observed to prevail so generally in aqueous deposits, is most frequently
due to variations in the velocity of running water, which cannot
sweep along particles of more than a certain size and weight when
moving at a given rate. Hence, as the force of the stream augments or
decreases, the materials thrown down in successive layers at particular
places are rudely sorted, according to their dimensions, form, and specific
gravity. Where this cause has not operated, as where sand, mud,
and fragments of rock are conveyed by a glacier, a confused heap of
rubbish devoid of all stratification is produced.</p>

<p>Natural divisions are also occasioned in deltas, by the interval of time
which separates annually the deposition of matter during the periodical
rains, or melting of snow upon the mountains. The deposit of each
year may acquire some degree of consistency before that of the succeeding
year is superimposed. A variety of circumstances also give rise
annually, or sometimes from day to day, to slight variations in color,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
fineness of the particles, and other characters, by which alternations of
strata distinct in texture and mineral ingredients must be produced.
Thus, for example, at one period of the year, drift-wood may be carried
down, and, at another, mud, as was before stated to be the case in the
delta of the Mississippi; or at one time, when the volume and velocity
of the stream are greatest, pebbles and sand may be spread over a certain
area, over which, when the waters are low, fine matter or chemical
precipitates are formed. During inundations, the turbid current of
fresh water often repels the sea for many miles; but when the river
is low, salt water again occupies the same space. When two deltas are
converging, the intermediate space is often, for reasons before explained,
alternately the receptacle of different sediments derived from the converging
streams (see p. <a href="#Page_272">272</a>). The one is, perhaps, charged with calcareous,
the other with argillaceous matter; or one sweeps down sand
and pebbles, the other impalpable mud. These differences may be
repeated with considerable regularity, until a thickness of hundreds of
feet of alternating beds is accumulated. The multiplication, also, of
shells and corals in particular spots, and for limited periods, gives rise
occasionally to lines of separation, and divides a mass which might
otherwise be homogeneous into distinct strata.</p>

<p>An examination of the shell marl now forming in the Scotch lakes, or
the sediment termed "warp," which subsides from the muddy water of
the Humber and other rivers, shows that recent deposits are often composed
of a great number of extremely thin layers, either even or slightly
undulating, and preserving a general parallelism to the planes of stratification.
Sometimes, however, the lamin&aelig; in modern strata are disposed
diagonally at a considerable angle, which appears to take place
where there are conflicting movements in the waters. In January, 1829,
I visited, in company with Professor L. A. Necker, of Geneva, the confluence
of the Rhone and Arve, when those rivers were very low, and
were cutting channels through the vast heaps of d&eacute;bris thrown down
from the waters of the Arve in the preceding spring. One of the sandbanks
which had formed, in the spring of 1828, where the opposing
currents of the two rivers neutralized each other, and caused a retardation
in the motion, had been undermined; and the following is an exact
representation of the arrangement of lamin&aelig; exposed in a vertical section.
The length of the portion here seen is about twelve feet, and the
height five. The strata <span class="smcap">A</span> <span class="smcap">A</span> consist of irregular alternations of pebbles
and sand in undulating beds: below these are seams of very fine sand
B B, some as thin as paper, others about a quarter of an inch thick. The
strata C C are composed of layers of fine greenish-gray sand as thin as
paper. Some of the inclined beds will be seen to be thicker at their
upper, others at their lower extremity, the inclination of some being
very considerable. These layers must have accumulated one on the
other by lateral apposition, probably when one of the rivers was very
gradually increasing or diminishing in velocity, so that the point of
greatest retardation caused by their conflicting currents shifted slowly,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
allowing the sediment to be thrown down in successive layers on a
sloping bank. The same phenomenon is exhibited in older strata of all
ages.<a name="FNanchor_376" id="FNanchor_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><p class="center2">Fig. 26.</p><a name="f26" id="f26"></a><img src="images/f26.png" width="550" height="258" alt="Section of a sand-bank." title="" />

<p class="center2">Section of a sand-bank in the bed of the Arve at its confluence with the Rhone, showing the
stratification of deposits where currents meet.</p></div>

<p>If the bed of a lake or of the sea be sinking, whether at a uniform or
an unequal rate, or oscillating in level during the deposition of sediment,
these movements will give rise to a different class of phenomena, as, for
example, to repeated alternations of shallow-water and deep-water deposits,
each with peculiar organic remains, or to frequent repetitions of
similar beds, formed at a uniform depth, and inclosing the same organic
remains, and to other results too complicated and varied to admit of
enumeration here.</p>

<p><i>Formation of conglomerates.</i>&mdash;Along the base of the Maritime Alps,
between Toulon and Genoa, the rivers, with few exceptions, are now
forming strata of conglomerate and sand. Their channels are often several
miles in breadth, some of them being dry, and the rest easily forded
for nearly eight months in the year, whereas during the melting of the
snow they are swollen, and a great transportation of mud and pebbles
takes place. In order to keep open the main road from France to Italy,
now carried along the sea-coast, it is necessary to remove annually great
masses of shingle brought down during the flood season. A portion of
the pebbles are seen in some localities, as near Nice, to form beds of
shingle along the shore, but the greater part are swept into a deep sea.
The small progress made by the deltas of minor rivers on this coast
need not surprise us, when we recollect that there is sometimes a depth
of two thousand feet at a few hundred yards from the beach, as near
Nice. Similar observations might be made respecting a large proportion
of the rivers in Sicily, and among others, respecting that which,
immediately north of the port of Messina, hurries annually vast masses
of granitic pebbles into the sea.</p>

<p><i>Constant interchange of land and sea.</i>&mdash;I may here conclude my remarks
on deltas, observing that, imperfect as is our information of the
changes which they have undergone within the last three thousand
years, they are sufficient to show how constant an interchange of sea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
and land is taking place on the face of our globe. In the Mediterranean
alone, many flourishing inland towns, and a still greater number of ports,
now stand where the sea rolled its waves since the era of the early civilization
of Europe. If we could compare with equal accuracy the ancient
and actual state of all the islands and continents, we should probably
discover that millions of our race are now supported by lands situated
where deep seas prevailed in earlier ages. In many districts not
yet occupied by man, land animals and forests now abound where ships
once sailed; and, on the other hand, we shall find, on inquiry, that inroads
of the ocean have been no less considerable. When to these revolutions,
produced by aqueous causes, we add analogous changes
wrought by igneous agency, we shall, perhaps, acknowledge the justice
of the conclusion of Aristotle, who declared that the whole land and
sea on our globe periodically changed places.<a name="FNanchor_377" id="FNanchor_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a></p>

<p>Although the movements of great bodies of water, termed tides and
currents, are in general due to very distinct causes, their effects cannot
be studied separately; for they produce, by their joint action, aided by
that of the waves, those changes which are objects of geological interest.
These forces may be viewed in the same manner as we before
considered rivers, first, as employed in destroying portions of the solid
crust of the earth and removing them to other places; secondly, as reproductive
of new strata.</p>

<p><i>Tides.</i>&mdash;It would be superfluous at the present day to offer any remarks
on the cause of the tides. They are not perceptible in lakes or
in most inland seas; in the Mediterranean even, deep and extensive as
is that sea, they are scarcely sensible to ordinary observation, their
effects being quite subordinate to those of the winds and currents. In
some places, however, as in the Straits of Messina, there is an ebb and
flow to the amount of two feet and upwards; at Naples and at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
Euripus, of twelve or thirteen inches; and at Venice, according to Rennell,
of five feet.<a name="FNanchor_378" id="FNanchor_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> In the Syrtes, also, of the ancients, two wide shallow
gulfs, which penetrate very far within the northern coast of Africa,
between Carthage and Cyrene, the rise is said to exceed five feet.<a name="FNanchor_379" id="FNanchor_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a></p>

<p>In islands remote from any continent, the ebb and flow of the ocean
is very slight, as at St. Helena, for example, where it is rarely above
three feet.<a name="FNanchor_380" id="FNanchor_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> In any given line of coast, the tides are greatest in narrow
channels, bays, and estuaries, and least in the intervening tracts where
the land is prominent. Thus, at the entrance of the estuary of the
Thames and Medway, the rise of the spring tides is eighteen feet; but
when we follow our eastern coast from thence northward, towards
Lowestoff and Yarmouth, we find a gradual diminution, until at the
places last mentioned, the highest rise is only seven or eight feet.
From this point there begins again to be an increase, so that at Comer,
where the coast again retires towards the west, the rise is sixteen feet;
and towards the extremity of the gulf called "the Wash," as at Lynn
and in Boston Deeps, it is from twenty-two to twenty-four feet, and in
some extraordinary cases twenty-six feet. From thence again there is
a decrease towards, the north, the elevation at the Spurn Point being
from nineteen to twenty feet, and at Flamborough Head and the Yorkshire
coast from fourteen to sixteen feet.<a name="FNanchor_381" id="FNanchor_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></p>

<p>At Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire, at the mouth of the Bristol
Channel, the tides rise thirty-six feet; and at King-Road near Bristol,
forty-two feet. At Chepstow on the Wye, a small river which opens
into the estuary of the Severn, they reach fifty feet, and sometimes
sixty-nine, and even seventy-two feet. A current which sets in on
the French coast, to the west of Cape La Hague, becomes pent up by
Guernsey, Jersey, and other islands, till the rise of the tide is from
twenty to forty-five feet, which last height it attains at Jersey, and at
St. Malo, a seaport of Brittany. The tides in the Basin of Mines, at the
head of the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia, rise to the height of seventy
feet.</p>

<p>There are, however, some coasts where the tides seem to offer an
exception to the rule above mentioned; for while there is scarcely any
rise in the estuary of the Plata in S. America, there is an extremely high
tide on the open coast of Patagonia, farther to the south. Yet even in
this region the tides reach their greatest elevation (about fifty feet) in
the Straits of Magellan, and so far at least they conform to the general
rule.<a name="FNanchor_382" id="FNanchor_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a></p>

<p><i>Currents.</i>&mdash;The most extensive and best determined system of currents,
is that which has its source in the Indian Ocean under the influence
of the trade winds; and which, after doubling the Cape of Good
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
Hope, inclines to the northward, along the western coast of Africa, then
across the Atlantic, near the equator, where it is called the equatorial
current, and is lost in the Caribbean Sea, yet seems to be again revived
in the current which issues from the Gulf of Mexico. From thence it
flows rapidly through the Straits of Bahama, taking the name of the
Gulf Stream, and passing in a northeasterly direction, by the Banks
of Newfoundland, towards the Azores.</p>

<p>We learn from the posthumous work of Rennell on this subject, that
the Lagullas current, so called from the cape and bank of that name, is
formed by the junction of two streams, flowing from the Indian Ocean;
the one from the channel of Mozambique, down the southeast coast of
Africa; the other from the ocean at large. The collective stream is
from ninety to one hundred miles in breadth, and runs at the rate of
from two and a half to more than four miles per hour. It is at length
turned westward by the Lagullas bank, which rises from a sea of great
depth to within one hundred fathoms of the surface. It must therefore
be inferred, says Rennell, that the current here is more than one hundred
fathoms deep, otherwise the main body of it would pass across the
bank, instead of being deflected westward, so as to flow round the Cape
of Good Hope. From this cape it flows northward, as before stated,
along the western coast of Africa, taking the name of the South Atlantic
current. It then enters the Bight, or Bay of Benin, and is turned westward,
partly by the form of the coast there, and partly, perhaps, by the
Guinea current, which runs from the north into the same great bay.
From the centre of this bay proceeds the equatorial current already
mentioned, holding a westerly direction across the Atlantic, which it
traverses, from the coast of Guinea to that of Brazil, flowing afterwards
by the shores of Guiana to the West Indies. The breadth of this current
varies from 160 to 450 geographical miles, and its velocity is from
twenty-five to seventy-nine miles per day, the mean rate being about
thirty miles. The length of its whole course is about 4000 miles. As
it skirts the coast of Guiana, it is increased by the influx of the waters
of the Amazon and Orinoco, and by their junction acquires accelerated
velocity. After passing the island of Trinidad it expands, and is almost
lost in the Caribbean Sea; but there appears to be a general movement
of that sea towards the Mexican Gulf, which discharges the most powerful
of all currents through the Straits of Florida, where the waters run
in the northern part with a velocity of four or five miles an hour, having
a breadth of from thirty-five to fifty miles.<a name="FNanchor_383" id="FNanchor_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>The temperature of the Gulf of Mexico is 86&deg; F. in summer, or 6&deg;
higher than that of the ocean, in the same parallel (25&deg; N. lat.), and
a large proportion of this warmth is retained, even where the stream
reaches the 43&deg; N. lat. After issuing from the Straits of Florida, the
current runs in a northerly direction to Cape Hatteras, in North Carolina,
about 35&deg; N. lat., where it is more than seventy miles broad, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
still moves at the rate of seventy-five miles per day. In about the 40&deg;
N. lat., it is turned more towards the Atlantic by the extensive banks
of Nantucket and St. George, which are from 200 to 300 feet beneath
the surface of the sea; a clear proof that the current exceeds that depth.
On arriving near the Azores, the stream widens, and overflows, as it
were, forming a large expanse of warm water in the centre of the North
Atlantic, over a space of 200 or 300 miles from north to south, and
having a temperature of from 8&deg; to 10&deg; Fahr. above the surrounding
ocean. The whole area, covered by the Gulf water, is estimated by
Rennell at 2000 miles in length, and, at a mean, 350 miles in breadth;
an area more extensive than that of the Mediterranean. The warm
water has been sometimes known to reach the Bay of Biscay, still retaining
five degrees of temperature above that of the adjoining ocean;
and a branch of the Gulf current occasionally drifts fruits, plants, and
wood, the produce of America and the West Indies, to the shores of
Ireland and the Hebrides.</p>

<p>From the above statements we may understand why Rennell has
characterized some of the principal currents as oceanic rivers, which he
describes as being from 50 to 250 miles in breadth, and having a
rapidity exceeding that of the largest navigable rivers of the continents,
and so deep as to be sometimes obstructed, and occasionally turned
aside, by banks, the tops of which do not rise within forty, fifty, or
even one hundred fathoms of the surface of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_384" id="FNanchor_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p><i>Greatest velocity of currents.</i>&mdash;The ordinary velocity of the principal
currents of the ocean is from one to three miles per hour; but when
the boundary lands converge, large bodies of water are driven gradually
into a narrow space, and then wanting lateral room, are compelled to
raise their level. Whenever this occurs their velocity is much increased.
The current which runs through the Race of Alderney, between
the island of that name and the main land, has a velocity of
about eight English miles an hour. Captain Hewett found that in the
Pentland Firth, the stream, in ordinary spring tides, runs ten miles and
a half an hour, and about thirteen miles during violent storms. The
greatest velocity of the tidal current through the "Shoots" or New
Passage, in the Bristol Channel, is fourteen English miles an hour;
and Captain King observed, in his survey of the Straits of Magellan,
that the tide ran at the same rate through the "First Narrows," and
about eight geographical miles an hour, in other parts of those straits.</p>

<p><i>Causes of currents.</i>&mdash;That movements of no inconsiderable magnitude
should be impressed on an expansive ocean, by winds blowing
for many months in one direction, may easily be conceived, when we
observe the effects produced in our own seas by the temporary action
of the same cause. It is well known that a strong southwest or northwest
wind invariably raises the tides to an unusual height along the
west coast of England and in the Channel; and that a northwest wind
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
of any continuance causes the Baltic to rise two feet and upwards
above its ordinary level. Smeaton ascertained by experiment, that in
a canal four miles in length, the water was kept up four inches higher
at one end than at the other, merely by the action of the wind along
the canal; and Rennell informs us that a large piece of water, ten
miles broad, and generally only three feet deep, has, by a strong wind,
had its waters driven to one side, and sustained so as to become six
feet deep, while the windward side was laid dry.<a name="FNanchor_385" id="FNanchor_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a></p>

<p>As water, therefore, he observes, when pent up so that it cannot
escape, acquires a higher level, so, in a place <i>where it can escape</i>, the
same operation produces a current; and this current will extend to a
greater or less distance, according to the force by which it is produced.
By the side of the principal oceanic currents, such as the Lagullas and
the Gulf Stream, are parallel "counter-currents" running steadily in an
opposite direction.</p>

<p>Currents flowing alternately in opposite directions are occasioned by
the rise and fall of the tides. The effect of this cause is, as before
observed, most striking in estuaries and channels between islands.</p>

<p>A third cause of oceanic currents is evaporation by solar heat, of
which the great current setting through the Straits of Gibraltar into the
Mediterranean is a remarkable example, and will be fully considered
in the next chapter. A stream of colder water also flows from the
Black Sea into the Mediterranean. It must happen in many other
parts of the world that large quantities of water raised from one tract
of the ocean by solar heat, are carried to some other where the vapor
is condensed and falls in the shape of rain, and this, in flowing back
again to restore equilibrium, will cause sensible currents.</p>

<p>These considerations naturally lead to the inquiry whether the level
of those seas out of which currents flow, is higher than that of seas into
which they flow. If not, the effect must be immediately equalized by
under-currents or counter-currents. Arago is of opinion that, so far as
observations have gone, there are no exact proofs of any such difference
of level. It was inferred from the measurements of M. Lep&eacute;re, that
the level of the Mediterranean, near Alexandria, was lower by 26 feet 6
inches, than the Red Sea near Suez at low water, and about 30 feet
lower than the Red Sea at the same place at high water,<a name="FNanchor_386" id="FNanchor_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a> but Mr.
Robert Stevenson affirms, as the result of a more recent survey, that
there is no difference of level between the two seas.<a name="FNanchor_387" id="FNanchor_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a></p>

<p>It was formerly imagined that there was an equal, if not greater,
diversity in the relative levels of the Atlantic and Pacific, on the opposite
sides of the Isthmus of Panama. But the levellings carried across
that isthmus by Capt. Lloyd, in 1828, to ascertain the relative height
of the Pacific Ocean at Panama, and of the Atlantic at the mouth of
the river Chagres, have shown, that the difference of mean level between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
those oceans is not considerable, and, contrary to expectation, the
difference which does exist is in favor of the greater height of the Pacific.
According to this survey, the mean height of the Pacific is three feet
and a half, or 3&middot;52 above the Atlantic, if we assume the mean level of a
sea to coincide with the mean between the extremes of the elevation
and depression of the tides; for between the extreme levels of the
greatest tides in the Pacific, at Panama, there is a difference of 27&middot;44
feet; and at the usual spring tides 21&middot;22 feet; whereas at Chagres
this difference is only 1&middot;16 feet, and is the same at all seasons of the
year.</p>

<p>The tides, in short, in the Caribbean Sea are scarcely perceptible, not
equalling those in some parts of the Mediterranean, whereas the rise is
very high in the Bay of Panama; so that the Pacific is at high tide
lifted up several feet above the surface of the Gulf of Mexico, and then
at low water let down as far below it.<a name="FNanchor_388" id="FNanchor_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a> But astronomers are agreed
that, on mathematical principles, the rise of the tidal wave above the
mean level of a particular sea must be greater than the fall below it;
and although the difference has been hitherto supposed insufficient to
cause an appreciable error, it is, nevertheless, worthy of observation,
that the error, such as it may be, would tend to reduce the small difference,
now inferred, from the observations of Mr. Lloyd, to exist between
the levels of the two oceans.</p>

<p>There is still another way in which heat and cold must occasion great
movements in the ocean, a cause to which, perhaps, currents are principally
due. Whenever the temperature of the surface of the sea is
lowered, condensation takes place, and the superficial water, having its
specific gravity increased, falls to the bottom, upon which lighter water
rises immediately and occupies its place. When this circulation of
ascending and descending currents has gone on for a certain time in
high latitudes, the inferior parts of the sea are made to consist of colder
or heavier fluid than the corresponding depths of the ocean between the
tropics. If there be a free communication, if no chain of submarine
mountains divide the polar from the equatorial basins, a horizontal movement
will arise by the flowing of colder water from the poles to the
equator, and there will then be a reflux of warmer superficial water
from the equator to the poles. A well-known experiment has been adduced
to elucidate this mode of action in explanation of the "trade
winds."<a name="FNanchor_389" id="FNanchor_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a> If a long trough, divided in the middle by a sluice or partition,
have one end filled with water and the other with quicksilver, both
fluids will remain quiet so long as they are divided; but when the sluice
is drawn up, the heavier fluid will rush along the bottom of the trough,
while the lighter, being displaced, will rise, and, flowing in an opposite
direction, spread itself at the top. In like manner the expansion and
contraction of sea-water by heat and cold, have a tendency to set under-currents
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
in motion from the poles to the equator, and to cause
counter-currents at the surface, which are impelled in a direction contrary
to that of the prevailing trade winds. The geographical and
other circumstances being very complicated, we cannot expect to trace
separately the movements due to each cause, but must be prepared for
many anomalies, especially as the configuration of the bed of the ocean
must often modify and interfere with the course of the inferior currents,
as much as the position and form of continents and islands alter the direction
of those on the surface. Thus on sounding at great depths in
the Mediterranean, Captains Berard and D'Urville have found that the
cold does not increase in a high ratio as in the tropical regions of the
ocean, the thermometer remaining fixed at about 55&deg; F. between the
depths of 1000 and 6000 feet. This might have been anticipated, as
Captain Smyth in his survey had shown that the deepest part of the
Straits of Gibraltar is only 1320 feet, so that a submarine barrier exists
there which must prevent the influx of any under-current of the ocean
cooled by polar ice.</p>

<p>Each of the four causes above mentioned, the wind, the tides, evaporation,
and the expansion and contraction of water by heat and cold,
may be conceived to operate independently of the others, and although
the influence of all the rest were annihilated. But there is another
cause, the rotation of the earth on its axis, which can only come into
play when the waters have already been set in motion by some one or
all of the forces above described, and when the direction of the current
so raised happens to be from south to north, or from north to
south.</p>

<p>The principle on which this cause operates is probably familiar to the
reader, as it has long been recognized in the case of the trade winds.
Without enlarging, therefore, on the theory, it will be sufficient to offer
an example of the mode of action alluded to. When a current flows
from the Cape of Good Hope towards the Gulf of Guinea, it consists of
a mass of water, which, on doubling the Cape, in lat. 35&deg;, has a rotatory
velocity of about 800 miles an hour; but when it reaches the line,
where it turns westward, it has arrived at a parallel where the surface
of the earth is whirled round at the rate of 1000 miles an hour, or
about 200 miles faster. If this great mass of water was transferred
suddenly from the higher to the lower latitude, the deficiency of its rotatory
motion, relatively to the land and water with which it would
come into juxtaposition, would be such as to cause an apparent motion
of the most rapid kind (of no less than 200 miles an hour) from east
to west.</p>

<p>In the case of such a sudden transfer, the eastern coast of America,
being carried round in an opposite direction, might strike against a large
body of water with tremendous violence, and a considerable part of the
continent might be submerged. This disturbance does not occur, because
the water of the stream, as it advances gradually into new zones
of the sea which are moving more rapidly, acquires by friction an accelerated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
velocity. Yet as this motion is not imparted instantaneously,
the fluid is unable to keep up with the full speed of the new surface
over which it is successively brought. Hence, to borrow the language
of Herschel, when he speaks of the trade winds, "it lags or hangs back,
in a direction opposite to the earth's rotation, that is, from east to
west,"<a name="FNanchor_390" id="FNanchor_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> and thus a current, which would have run simply towards
the north but for the rotation, may acquire a relative direction towards
the west.</p>

<p>We may next consider a case where the circumstances are the converse
of the above. The Gulf Stream flowing from about lat. 20&deg; is at
first impressed with a velocity of rotation of about 940 miles an hour,
and runs to the lat. 40&deg;, where the earth revolves only at the rate of
766 miles, or 174 miles slower. In this case a relative motion of an
opposite kind may result; and the current may retain an excess of rotatory
velocity, tending continually to deflect it eastward. Polar currents,
therefore, or those flowing from high to low latitudes, are driven towards
the eastern shores of continents, while tropical currents flowing towards
the poles are directed against their western shores.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that currents depend, like the tides, on no temporary
or accidental circumstances, but on the laws which preside over
the motions of the heavenly bodies. But although the sum of their
influence in altering the surface of the earth may be very constant
throughout successive epochs, yet the points where these operations are
displayed in fullest energy shift perpetually. The height to which the
tides rise, and the violence and velocity of currents, depend in a great
measure on the actual configuration of the land, the contour of a long
line of continental or insular coast, the depth and breadth of channels,
the peculiar form of the bottom of seas&mdash;in a word, on a combination of
circumstances which are made to vary continually by many igneous and
aqueous causes, and, amongst the rest, by the tides and currents themselves.
Although these agents, therefore, of decay and reproduction are
local in reference to periods of short duration, such as those which history
embraces, they are nevertheless universal, if we extend our views to a
sufficient lapse of ages.</p>

<p><i>Destroying and transporting power of currents.</i>&mdash;After these preliminary
remarks on the nature and causes of currents, their velocity and
direction, we may next consider their action on the solid materials of the
earth. We shall find that their efforts are, in many respects, strictly
analogous to those of rivers. I have already treated in the third chapter,
of the manner in which currents sometimes combine with ice, in
carrying mud, pebbles, and large fragments of rock to great distances.
Their operations are more concealed from our view than those of rivers,
but extend over wider areas, and are therefore of more geological
importance.</p>

<p><i>Waste of the British coasts.</i>&mdash;<i>Shetland Islands</i>.&mdash;If we follow the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
eastern and southern shores of the British islands, from our Ultima
Thule in Shetland to the Land's End in Cornwall, we shall find evidence
of a series of changes since the historical era, very illustrative of the
kind and degree of force exerted by tides and currents co-operating with
the waves of the sea. In this survey we shall have an opportunity of
tracing their joint power on islands, promontories, bays, and estuaries;
on bold, lofty cliffs, as well as on low shores; and on every description
of rock and soil, from granite to blown sand.</p>

<p>The northernmost group of the British islands, the Shetland, are composed
of a great variety of rocks, including granite, gneiss, mica-slate,
serpentine, greenstone, and many others, with some secondary rocks,
chiefly sandstone and conglomerate. These islands are exposed continually
to the uncontrolled violence of the Atlantic, for no land intervenes
between their western shores and America. The prevalence, therefore,
of strong westerly gales, causes the waves to be sometimes driven with
irresistible force upon the coast, while there is also a current setting from
the north. The spray of the sea aids the decomposition of the rocks,
and prepares them to be breached by the mechanical force of the waves.
Steep cliffs are hollowed out into deep caves and lofty arches; and almost
every promontory ends in a cluster of rocks, imitating the forms of
columns, pinnacles, and obelisks.</p>

<p><i>Drifting of large masses of rock.</i>&mdash;Modern observations show that the
reduction of continuous tracts to such insular masses is a process in
which nature is still actively engaged. "The isle of Stenness," says Dr.
Hibbert, "presents a scene of unequalled desolation. In stormy winters,
huge blocks of stones are overturned, or are removed from their native
beds, and hurried up a slight acclivity to a distance almost incredible.
In the winter of 1802, a tabular-shaped mass, eight feet two inches by
seven feet, and five feet one inch thick, was dislodged from its bed, and
removed to a distance of from eighty to ninety feet. I measured the
recent bed from which a block had been carried away the preceding
winter (<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1818), and found it to be seventeen feet and a half by
seven feet, and the depth two feet eight inches. The removed mass had
been borne to a distance of thirty feet, when it was shivered into thirteen
or more lesser fragments, some of which, were carried still farther,
from 30 to 120 feet. A block, nine feet two inches by six feet and a
half, and four feet thick, was hurried up the acclivity to a distance of
150 feet."<a name="FNanchor_391" id="FNanchor_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a></p>

<p>At Northmavine, also, angular blocks of stone have been removed in
a similar manner to considerable distances by the waves of the sea, some
of which are represented in the annexed figure.</p>

<p><i>Effects of lightning.</i>&mdash;In addition to numerous examples of masses
detached and driven by the waves, tides, and currents from their
place, some remarkable effects of lightning are recorded in these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
isles. At Funzie, in Fetlar, about the middle of the last century, a
rock of mica-schist, 105 feet long, ten feet broad, and in some places
four feet thick, was in an instant torn by a flash of lightning from its
bed, and broken into three large and several smaller fragments. One
of these, twenty-six feet long, ten feet broad, and four feet thick, was
simply turned over. The second, which was twenty-eight feet long,
seventeen broad, and five feet in thickness, was hurled across a high
point to the distance of fifty yards. Another broken mass, about forty
feet long, was thrown still farther, but in the same direction, quite into
the sea. There were also many smaller fragments scattered up and
down.<a name="FNanchor_392" id="FNanchor_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a></p>

<p class="center2">Stony fragments drifted by the sea. Northmavine, Shetland.</p></div>

<p>When we thus see electricity co-operating with the violent movements
of the ocean in heaping up piles of shattered rocks on dry land
and beneath the waters, we cannot but admit that a region which shall
be the theatre, for myriads of ages, of the action of such disturbing
causes, might present, at some future period, if upraised far above the
bosom of the deep, a scene of havoc and ruin that may compare with
any now found by the geologist on the surface of our continents.</p>

<p>In some of the Shetland Isles, as on the west of Meikle Roe, dikes, or
veins of soft granite, have mouldered away; while the matrix in which
they were inclosed, being of the same substance, but of a firmer texture,
has remained unaltered. Thus, long narrow ravines, sometimes
twenty feet wide, are laid open, and often give access to the waves.
After describing some huge cavernous apertures into which the sea
flows for 250 feet in Roeness, Dr. Hibbert, writing in 1822, enumerates
other ravages of the ocean. "A mass of rock, the average dimensions
of which may perhaps be rated at twelve or thirteen feet square, and
four and a half or five in thickness, was first moved from its bed, about
fifty years ago, to a distance of thirty feet, and has since been twice
turned over."</p>

<p><i>Passage forced by the sea through porphyritic rocks.</i>&mdash;"But the most
sublime scene is where a mural pile of porphyry, escaping the process
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
of disintegration that is devastating the coast, appears to have been left
as a sort of rampart against the inroads of the ocean;&mdash;the Atlantic,
when provoked by wintry gales, batters against it with all the force of
real artillery&mdash;the waves having, in their repeated assaults, forced themselves
an entrance. This breach, named the Grind of the Navir (fig.
28), is widened every winter by the overwhelming surge that, finding a
passage through it, separates large stones from its sides, and forces
them to a distance of no less than 180 feet. In two or three spots,
the fragments which have been detached are brought together in immense
heaps, that appear as an accumulation of cubical masses, the
product of some quarry."<a name="FNanchor_393" id="FNanchor_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a></p>

<p class="center2">Grind of the Navir&mdash;passage forced by the sea through rocks of hard porphyry.</p></div>

<p>It is evident from this example, that although the greater indestructibility
of some rocks may enable them to withstand, for a longer time,
the action of the elements, yet they cannot permanently resist. There
are localities in Shetland, in which rocks of almost every variety of
mineral composition are suffering disintegration; thus the sea makes
great inroads on the clay slate of Fitfel Head, on the serpentine of the
Vord Hill in Fetlar, and on the mica-schist of the Bay of Triesta, on
the east coast of the same island, which decomposes into angular blocks.
The quartz rock on the east of Walls, and the gneiss and mica-schist of
Garthness, suffer the same fate.</p>

<p><i>Destruction of islands.</i>&mdash;Such devastation cannot be incessantly committed
for thousands of years without dividing islands, until they become
at last mere clusters of rocks, the last shreds of masses once continuous.
To this state many appear to have been reduced, and innumerable
fantastic forms are assumed by rocks adjoining these islands to which
the name of Drongs is applied, as it is to those of similar shape in Feroe.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 29.</span><a name="f29" id="f29"></a><img src="images/f29.png" width="550" height="365" alt="" title="Granitic rocks named the Drongs, between Papa Stour and Hillswick Ness." />

<p class="center2">Granitic rocks to the south of Hillswick Ness, Shetland.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
The granite rocks (<a href="#f29">fig. 29</a>), between Papa Stour and Hillswick Ness
afford an example. A still more singular cluster of rocks is seen to
the south of Hillswick Ness (<a href="#f30">fig. 30</a>), which presents a variety of forms
as viewed from different points, and has often been likened to a small
fleet of vessels with spread sails.<a name="FNanchor_394" id="FNanchor_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> We may imagine that in the course
of time Hillswick Ness itself may present a similar wreck, from the
unequal decomposition of the rocks whereof it is composed, consisting of
gneiss and mica-schist traversed in all directions by veins of felspar-porphyry.</p>

<p>Midway between the groups of Shetland and Orkney is Fair Island,
said to be composed of sandstone with high perpendicular cliffs. The
current runs with such velocity, that during a calm, and when there is
no swell, the rocks on its shores are white with the foam of the sea
driven against them. The Orkneys, if carefully examined, would probably
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
illustrate our present topic as much as the Shetland group. The
northeast promontory of Sanda, one of these islands, has been cut off in
modern times by the sea, so that it became what is now called Start
Island, where a lighthouse was erected in 1807, since which time the
new strait has grown broader.</p>

<p><i>East coast of Scotland.</i>&mdash;To pass over to the main land of Scotland,
we find that in Inverness-shire there have been inroads of the sea at
Fort George, and others in Morayshire, which have swept away the old
town of Findhorn. On the coast of Kincardineshire, an illustration was
afforded at the close of the last century, of the effect of promontories
in protecting a line of low shore. The village of Mathers, two miles
south of Johnshaven, was built on an ancient shingle beach, protected
by a projecting ledge of limestone rock. This was quarried for lime to
such an extent that the sea broke through, and in 1795 carried away
the whole village in one night, and penetrated 150 yards inland, where
it has maintained its ground ever since, the new village having been
built farther inland on the new shore. In the bay of Montrose, we find
the North Esk and the South Esk rivers pouring annually into the sea
large quantities of sand and pebbles; yet they have formed no deltas,
for the waves, aided by the current, setting across their mouths, sweep
away all the materials. Considerable beds of shingle, brought down by
the North Esk, are seen along the beach.</p>

<p>Proceeding southwards, we learn that at Arbroath, in Forfarshire,
which stands on a rock of red sandstone, gardens and houses have been
carried away since the commencement of the present century by encroachments
of the sea. It had become necessary before 1828, to
remove the lighthouses at the mouth of the estuary of the Tay, in the
same county, at Button Ness, which were built on a tract of blown
sand, the sea having encroached for three-quarters of a mile.</p>

<p><i>Force of waves and currents in estuaries.</i>&mdash;The combined power
which waves and currents can exert in <i>estuaries</i> (a term which I
confine to bays entered both by rivers and the tides of the sea),
was remarkably exhibited during the building of the Bell Rock Lighthouse,
off the mouth of the Tay. The Bell Rock is a sunken reef,
consisting of red sandstone, being from twelve to sixteen feet under
the surface at high water, and about twelve miles from the mainland.
At the distance of 100 yards, there is a depth, in all directions
of two or three fathoms at low water. In 1807, during the erection
of the lighthouse, six large blocks of granite, which had been landed
on the reef, were removed by the force of the sea, and thrown over
a rising ledge to the distance of twelve or fifteen paces; and an anchor,
weighing about 22 cwt., was thrown up upon the rock.<a name="FNanchor_395" id="FNanchor_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a> Mr. Stevenson
informs us moreover, that drift stones, measuring upwards of
thirty cubic feet, or more than two tons' weight, have, during storms,
been often thrown upon the rock from the deep water.<a name="FNanchor_396" id="FNanchor_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span><i>Submarine forests.</i>&mdash;Among the proofs that the sea has encroached
on the land bordering the estuary of the Tay, Dr. Fleming has mentioned
a submarine forest which has been traced for several miles along
the northern shore of the county of Fife.<a name="FNanchor_397" id="FNanchor_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> But subsequent surveys
seem to have shown that the bed of peat containing tree-roots, leaves,
and branches, now occurring at a lower level than the Tay, must have
come into its present position by a general sinking of the ground on
which the forest grew. The peat-bed alluded to is not confined, says
Mr. Buist, to the present channel of the Tay, but extends far beyond it,
and is covered by stratified clay from fifteen to twenty-five feet in thickness,
in the midst of which, in some places, is a bed full of
sea-shells.<a name="FNanchor_398" id="FNanchor_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a>
Recent discoveries having established the fact that upward and downward
movements have affected our island since the general coast-line
had nearly acquired its present shape, we must hesitate before we attribute
any given change to a single cause, such as the local encroachment
of the sea upon low land.</p>

<p>On the coast of Fife, at St. Andrew's, a tract of land, said to have
intervened between the castle of Cardinal Beaton and the sea, has been
entirely swept away, as were the last remains of the Priory of Crail, in
the same county, in 1803. On both sides of the Frith of Forth, land
has been consumed; at North Berwick in particular, and at Newhaven,
where an arsenal and dock, built in the reign of James IV., in the fifteenth
century, has been overflowed.</p>

<p><i>East coast of England.</i>&mdash;If we now proceed to the English coast, we
find records of numerous lands having been destroyed in Northumberland,
as those near Bamborough and Holy Island, and at Tynemouth
Castle, which now overhangs the sea, although formerly separated from
it by a strip of land. At Hartlepool, and several other parts of the
coast of Durham composed of magnesian limestone, the sea has made
considerable inroads.</p>

<p><i>Coast of Yorkshire.</i>&mdash;Almost the whole coast of Yorkshire, from the
mouth of the Tees to that of the Humber, is in a state of gradual dilapidation.
That part of the cliffs which consist of lias, the oolite series,
and chalk, decays slowly. They present abrupt and naked precipices,
often 300 feet in height; and it is only at a few points that the grassy
covering of the sloping talus marks a temporary relaxation of the erosive
action of the sea. The chalk cliffs are worn into caves and needles in
the projecting headland of Flamborough, where they are decomposed
by the salt spray, and slowly crumble away. But the waste is most
rapid between that promontory and Spurn Point, or the coast of Holderness,
as it is called, a tract consisting of beds of clay, gravel, sand,
and chalk rubble. The irregular intermixture of the argillaceous beds
causes many springs to be thrown out, and this facilitates the undermining
process, the waves beating against them, and a strong current
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
setting chiefly from the north. The wasteful action is very conspicuous
at Dimlington Height, the loftiest point in Holderness, where the beacon
stands on a cliff 146 feet above high water, the whole being composed
of clay, with pebbles scattered through it.<a name="FNanchor_399" id="FNanchor_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> "For many years," says
Professor Phillips, "the rate at which the cliffs recede from Bridlington
to Spurn, a distance of thirty-six miles, has been found by measurement
to equal on an average two and a quarter yards annually, which, upon
thirty-six miles of coast, would amount to about thirty acres a year.
At this rate, the coast, the mean height of which above the sea is about
forty feet, has lost one mile in breadth since the Norman Conquest, and
more than two miles since the occupation of York (Eboracum) by the
Romans."<a name="FNanchor_400" id="FNanchor_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> The extent of this denudation, as estimated by the number
of cubic feet of matter removed annually, will be again spoken of in
chapter 22.</p>

<p>In the old maps of Yorkshire, we find spots, now sand-banks in the sea,
marked as the ancient sites of the towns and villages of Auburn, Hartburn,
and Hyde. "Of Hyde," says Pennant, "only the tradition is
left; and near the village of Hornsea, a street called Hornsea Beck has
long since been swallowed."<a name="FNanchor_401" id="FNanchor_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> Owthorne and its church have also been
in great part destroyed, and the village of Kilnsea; but these places
are now removed farther inland. The annual rate of encroachment at
Owthorne for several years preceding 1830, is stated to have averaged
about four yards. Not unreasonable fears are entertained that at some
future time the Spurn Point will become an island, and that the ocean,
entering into the estuary of the Humber, will cause great devastation.<a name="FNanchor_402" id="FNanchor_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a>
Pennant, after speaking of the silting up of some ancient ports in that
estuary, observes, "But, in return, the sea has made most ample reprisals;
the site, and even the very names of several places, once towns
of note upon the Humber, are now only recorded in history; and
Ravensper was at one time a rival to Hull (Madox, Ant. Exch. i. 422),
and a port so very considerable in 1332, that Edward Baliol and the
confederated English barons sailed from hence to invade Scotland; and
Henry IV., in 1399, made choice of this port to land at, to effect the
deposal of Richard II.; yet the whole of this has long since been devoured
by the merciless ocean; extensive sands, dry at low water, are
to be seen in their stead."<a name="FNanchor_403" id="FNanchor_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a></p>

<p>Pennant describes Spurn Head as a promontory in the form of a
sickle, and says the land, for some miles to the north, was "perpetually
preyed on by the fury of the German Sea, which devours whole acres
at a time, and exposes on the shores considerable quantities of beautiful
amber."</p>

<p><i>Lincolnshire.</i>&mdash;The maritime district of Lincolnshire consists chiefly
of lands that lie below the level of the sea, being protected by embankments.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span>
Some of the fens were embanked and drained by the Romans;
but after their departure the sea returned, and large tracts were covered
with beds of silt, containing marine shells, now again converted into
productive lands. Many dreadful catastrophes are recorded by incursions
of the sea, whereby several parishes have been at different times
overwhelmed.</p>

<p><i>Norfolk.</i>&mdash;The decay of the cliffs of Norfolk and Suffolk is incessant.
At Hunstanton, on the north, the undermining of the lower arenaceous
beds at the foot of the cliff, causes masses of red and white chalk to be
precipitated from above. Between Hunstanton and Weybourne, low
hills, or dunes, of blown sand, are formed along the shore, from fifty to
sixty feet high. They are composed of dry sand, bound in a compact
mass by the long creeping roots of the plant called Marram (<i>Arundo
arenaria</i>). Such is the present set of the tides, that the harbors of
Clay, Wells, and other places are securely defended by these barriers;
affording a clear proof that it is not the strength of the material at particular
points that determines whether the sea shall be progressive or
stationary, but the general contour of the coast.</p>

<p>The waves constantly undermine the low chalk cliffs, covered with
sand and clay, between Weybourne and Sherringham, a certain portion
of them being annually removed. At the latter town I ascertained, in
1829, some facts which throw light on the rate at which the sea gains
upon the land. It was computed, when the present inn was built, in
1805, that it would require seventy years for the sea to reach the spot:
the mean loss of land being calculated, from previous observations, to
be somewhat less than one yard, annually. The distance between the
house and the sea was fifty yards; but no allowance was made for the
slope of the ground being <i>from</i> the sea, in consequence of which the
waste was naturally accelerated every year, as the cliff grew lower,
there being at each succeeding period less matter to remove when portions
of equal area fell down. Between the years 1824 and 1829, no
less than seventeen yards were swept away, and only a small garden
was then left between the building and the sea. There was, in 1829,
a depth of twenty feet (sufficient to float a frigate) at one point in the
harbor of that port, where, only forty-eight years before, there stood a
cliff fifty feet high, with houses upon it! If once in half a century an
equal amount of change were produced suddenly by the momentary
shock of an earthquake, history would be filled with records of such wonderful
revolutions of the earth's surface; but, if the conversion of high
land into deep sea be gradual, it excites only local attention. The flagstaff
of the Preventive Service station, on the south side of this harbor,
was thrice removed inland between the years 1814 and 1829, in consequence
of the advance of the sea.</p>

<p>Farther to the south we find cliffs, composed, like those of Holderness
before mentioned, of alternating strata of blue clay, gravel, loam,
and fine sand. Although they sometimes exceed 300 feet in height, the
havoc made on the coast is most formidable. The whole site of ancient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span>
Cromer now forms part of the German Ocean, the inhabitants having
gradually retreated inland to their present situation, from whence the
sea still threatens to dislodge them. In the winter of 1825, a fallen
mass was precipitated from near the lighthouse, which covered twelve
acres, extending far into the sea, the cliffs being 250 feet in height.<a name="FNanchor_404" id="FNanchor_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a>
The undermining by springs has sometimes caused large portions of the
upper part of the cliffs, with houses still standing upon them, to give
way, so that it is impossible, by erecting breakwaters at the base of the
cliffs, permanently to ward off the danger.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 31.</span><a name="f31" id="f31"></a><img src="images/f31.png" width="550" height="363" alt="Tower of the buried Church of Eccles, Norfolk." title="" />

The inland slope of the hills of blown sand is shown in this view, with the lighthouse of
Hasborough in the distance.</p></div>

<p>On the same coast, says Mr. R. C. Taylor, the ancient villages of
Shipden, Wimpwell, and Eccles have disappeared; several manors and
large portions of neighboring parishes having, piece after piece, been
swallowed up; nor has there been any intermission, from time immemorial,
in the ravages of the sea along a line of coast twenty miles in
length, in which these places stood.<a name="FNanchor_405" id="FNanchor_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a> Of Eccles, however, a monument
still remains in the rained tower of the old church, which is half
buried in the dunes of sand within a few paces (60?) of the sea-beach
(<a href="#f31">fig. 31</a>). So early as 1605 the inhabitants petitioned James I. for a
reduction of taxes, as 300 acres of land, and all their houses, save fourteen,
had then been destroyed by the sea. Not one half that number
of acres now remains in the parish, and hills of blown sand now occupy
the site of the houses which were still extant in 1605. When I visited
the spot in 1839, the sea was fast encroaching on the sand-hills, and
had laid open on the beach the foundations of a house fourteen yards
square, the upper part of which had evidently been pulled down before
it had been buried under sand. The body of the church has also been
long buried, but the tower still remains visible.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
M. E. de Beaumont has suggested that sand-dunes in Holland and
other countries may serve as natural chronometers, by which the date
of the existing continents may be ascertained. The sands, he says, are
continually blown inland by the force of the winds, and by observing
the rate of their march we may calculate the period when the movement
commenced.<a name="FNanchor_406" id="FNanchor_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> But the example just given will satisfy every geologist
that we cannot ascertain the starting-point of dunes, all coasts
being liable to waste, and the shores of the Low Countries in particular,
being not only exposed to inroads of the sea, but, as M. de Beaumont
himself has well shown, having even in historical times undergone a
change of level. The dunes may indeed, in some cases, be made use
of as chronometers, to enable us to assign a minimum of antiquity to
existing coast-lines; but this test must be applied with great caution, so
variable is the rate at which the sands may advance into the interior.</p>

<p>Hills of blown sand, between Eccles and Winterton, have barred up
and excluded the tide for many hundred years from the mouths of
several small estuaries; but there are records of nine breaches, from 20
to 120 yards wide, having been made through these, by which immense
damage was done to the low grounds in the interior. A few miles
south of Happisburgh, also, are hills of blown sand, which extend to
Yarmouth. These <i>dunes</i> afford a temporary protection to the coast,
and an inland cliff, about a mile long, at Winterton, shows clearly that
at that point the sea must have penetrated formerly farther than at
present.</p>

<p><i>Silting up of estuaries/</i>&mdash;At Yarmouth, the sea has not advanced
upon the sands in the slightest degree since the reign of Elizabeth. In
the time of the Saxons, a great estuary extended as far as Norwich,
which city, is represented; even in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
as "situated on the banks of an arm of the sea." The sands
whereon Yarmouth is built, first became firm and habitable ground
about the year 1008, from which time a line of dunes has gradually increased
in height and breadth, stretching across the whole entrance of
the ancient estuary, and obstructing the ingress of the tides so completely,
that they are only admitted by the narrow passage which the
river keeps open, and which has gradually shifted several miles to the
south. The ordinary tides at the river's mouth rise, at present, only to
the height, of three or four feet, the spring tides to about eight or nine.</p>

<p>By the exclusion of the sea, thousands of acres in the interior have
become cultivated lands; and, exclusive of smaller pools, upwards of
sixty freshwater lakes have been formed, varying in depth from fifteen
to thirty feet, and in extent from one acre to twelve hundred.<a name="FNanchor_407" id="FNanchor_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> The
Yare, and other rivers, frequently communicate with these sheets of
water; and thus they are liable to be filled up gradually with lacustrine
and fluviatile deposits, and to be converted into land covered with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">308</a></span>
forests. Yet it must not be imagined, that the acquisition of new land
fit for cultivation in Norfolk and Suffolk indicates any permanent growth
of the eastern limits of our island to compensate its reiterated losses.
No <i>delta</i> can form on such a shore.</p>

<p>Immediately off Yarmouth, and parallel to the shore, is a great range
of sand-banks, the shape of which varies slowly from year to year, and
often suddenly after great storms. Captain Hewitt, R. N., found in
these banks, in 1836, a broad channel sixty-five feet deep, where there
was only a depth of four feet during a prior survey in 1822. The sea
had excavated to the depth of sixty feet in the course of fourteen years,
or perhaps a shorter period. The new channel thus formed serves at
present (1838), for the entrance of ships into Yarmouth Roads; and
the magnitude of this change shows how easily a new set of the waves
and currents might endanger the submergence of the land gained within
the ancient estuary of the Yare.</p>

<p>That great banks should be thrown across the mouths of estuaries on
our eastern coast, where there is not a large body of river-water to
maintain an open channel, is perfectly intelligible, when we bear in mind
that the marine current, sweeping along the coast, is charged with the
materials of wasting cliffs, and ready to form a bar anywhere the instant
its course is interrupted or checked by any opposing stream. The mouth
of the Yare has been, within the last five centuries, diverted about four
miles to the south. In like manner it is evident that, at some remote
period, the river Alde entered the sea at Aldborough, until its ancient
outlet was barred up and at length transferred to a point no less than
ten miles distant to the southwest. In this case, ridges of sand and
shingle, like those of Lowestoff Ness, which will be described by and
by, have been thrown up between the river and the sea; and an ancient
sea-cliff is to be seen now inland.</p>

<p>It may be asked why the rivers on our east coast are always deflected
southwards, although the tidal current flows alternately from the south
and north? The cause is to be found in the superior force of what is
commonly called "the flood tide from the north," a tidal wave derived
from the Atlantic, a small part of which passes eastward up the English
Channel, and through the Straits of Dover and then northwards, while
the principal body of water, moving much more rapidly in a more open
sea, on the western side of Britain, first passes the Orkneys, and then
turning, flows down between Norway and Scotland, and sweeps with
great velocity along our eastern coast. It is well known that the highest
tides on this coast are occasioned by a powerful northwest wind,
which raises the eastern part of the Atlantic, and causes it to pour a
greater volume of water into the German Ocean. This circumstance of
a violent <i>off-shore</i> wind being attended with a rise of the waters, instead
of a general retreat of the sea, naturally excites the wonder of the inhabitants
of our coast. In many districts they look with confidence for
a rich harvest of that valuable manure, the sea-weed, when the north-westerly
gales prevail, and are rarely disappointed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span><i>Coast of Suffolk.</i>&mdash;The cliffs of Suffolk, to which we next proceed,
are somewhat less elevated than those of Norfolk, but composed of
similar alternations of clay, sand, and gravel. From Gorleston in Suffolk,
to within a few miles north of Lowestoff, the cliffs are slowly
undermined. Near the last-mentioned town, there is an inland cliff
about sixty feet high, the sloping talus of which is covered with turf
and heath. Between the cliff and the sea is a low flat tract of sand
called the Ness, nearly three miles long, and for the most part out of
reach of the highest tides. The point of the Ness projects from the
base of the original cliff to the distance of 660 yards. This accession
of land, says Mr. Taylor, has been effected at distinct and distant intervals,
by the influence of currents running between the land and a shoal
about a mile off Lowestoff, called the Holm Sand. The lines of growth
in the Ness are indicated by a series of concentric ridges or embankments
inclosing limited areas, and several of these ridges have been
formed within the observation of persons now living. A rampart of
heavy materials is first thrown up to an unusual altitude by some
extraordinary tide, attended with a violent gale. Subsequent tides
extend the base of this high bank of shingle, and the interstices are
then filled with sand blown from the beach. The Arundo and other
marine plants by degrees obtain a footing; and creeping along the
ridge, give solidity to the mass, and form in some cases a matted covering
of turf. Meanwhile another mound is forming externally, which
by the like process rises and gives protection to the first. If the sea
forces its way through one of the external and incomplete mounds, the
breach is soon repaired. After a while the marine plants within the
areas inclosed by these embankments are succeeded by a better species
of herbage affording good pasturage, and the sands become sufficiently
firm to support buildings.</p>

<p><i>Destruction of Dunwich by the sea.</i>&mdash;Of the gradual destruction of
Dunwich, once the most considerable seaport on this coast, we have
many authentic records. Gardner, in his history of that borough,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
published in 1754, shows, by reference to documents, beginning with
Doomsday Book, that the cliffs at Dunwich, Southwold, Eastern, and
Pakefield, have been always subject to wear away. At Dunwich, in
particular, two tracts of land which had been taxed in the eleventh century,
in the time of King Edward the Confessor, are mentioned in the
Conqueror's survey, made but a few years afterwards, as having been
devoured by the sea. The losses, at a subsequent period, of a monastery,&mdash;at
another of several churches,&mdash;afterwards of the old port,&mdash;then
of four hundred houses at once,&mdash;of the church of St. Leonard,
the high-road, town-hall, jail, and many other buildings, are mentioned,
with the dates when they perished. It is stated that, in the
sixteenth century, not one-quarter of the town was left standing; yet
the inhabitants retreating inland, the name was preserved, as has been
the case with many other ports when their ancient site has been blotted
out. There is, however, a church of considerable antiquity still
standing, the last of twelve mentioned in some records. In 1740, the
laying open of the churchyard of St. Nicholas and St. Francis, in the
sea-cliffs, is well described by Gardner, with the coffins and skeletons
exposed to view&mdash;some lying on the beach, and rocked</p>

<p>
"In cradle of the rude imperious surge."
</p>

<p>Of these cemeteries no remains can now be seen. Ray also says, "that
ancient writings make mention of a wood a mile and a half to the east
of Dunwich, the site of which must at present be so far within the
sea."<a name="FNanchor_409" id="FNanchor_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> This city, once so flourishing and populous, is now a small
village, with about twenty houses, and one hundred inhabitants.</p>

<p>There is an old tradition, "that the tailors sat in their shops at
Dunwich, and saw the ships in Yarmouth Bay;" but when we consider
how far the coast at Lowestoff Ness projects between these places,
we cannot give credit to the tale, which, nevertheless, proves how much
the inroads of the sea in times of old had prompted men of lively imagination
to indulge their taste for the marvellous.</p>

<p>Gardner's description of the cemeteries laid open by the waves reminds
us of the scene which has been so well depicted by Bewick,<a name="FNanchor_410" id="FNanchor_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a>
and of which numerous points on the same coast might have suggested
the idea. On the verge of a cliff, which the sea has undermined, are
represented the unshaken tower and western end of an abbey. The
eastern aisle is gone, and the pillars of the cloister are soon to follow.
The waves have almost isolated the promontory, and invaded the cemetery,
where they have made sport with the mortal relics, and thrown
up a skull upon the beach. In the foreground is seen a broken tombstone,
erected, as its legend tells, "to <i>perpetuate</i> the memory"&mdash;of
one whose name is obliterated, as is that of the county for which he
was "Custos Rotulorum." A cormorant is perched on the monument,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
defiling it, as if to remind some moralizer like Hamlet, of "the base
uses" to which things sacred may be turned. Had this excellent artist
desired to satirize certain popular theories of geology, he might have
inscribed the stone to the memory of some philosopher who taught
"the permanency of existing continents"&mdash;"the era of repose"&mdash;"the
impotence of modern causes."</p>

<p>The incursions of the sea at Aldborough, were formerly very destructive,
and this borough is known to have been once situated a quarter of
a mile east of the present shore. The inhabitants continued to build
farther inland, till they arrived at the extremity of their property, and
then the town decayed greatly; but two sand-banks, thrown up at a
short distance, now afford a temporary safeguard to the coast. Between
these banks and the present shore, where the current now flows, the
sea is twenty-four feet deep on the spot where the town formerly stood.</p>

<p><i>Essex.</i>&mdash;Harwich is said to have owed its rise to the destruction of
Orwell, a town which stood on the spot now called "the west rocks,"
and was overwhelmed by an inroad of the sea since the Conquest. Apprehensions
have been entertained that the isthmus on which Harwich
stands may at no remote period become an island, for the sea may be
expected to make a breach near Lower Dover Court, where Beacon
Cliff is composed of horizontal beds of London clay containing septaria.
It had wasted away considerably between the years 1829 and 1838, at
both which periods I examined this coast. In that short interval several
gardens and many houses had been swept into the sea, and in April,
1838, a whole street was threatened with destruction. The advance of
the sea is much accelerated by the traffic carried on in septaria, which
are shipped off for cement as fast as they fall down upon the beach.
These stones, if allowed to remain in heaps on the shore, would break
the force of the waves and retard the conversion of the peninsula into an
island, an event which might be followed by the destruction of the town
of Harwich. Captain Washington, R. N., ascertained in 1847, that
Beacon Cliff, above mentioned, which is about fifty feet high, had given
way at the rate of forty feet in forty-seven years, between 1709 and
1756; eighty feet between 1756 and 1804; and three hundred and
fifty feet between the latter period and 1841; showing a rapidly accelerated
rate of destruction.<a name="FNanchor_411" id="FNanchor_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a></p>

<p>Among other losses it is recorded that, since the year 1807, a field
called the Vicar's Field, which belonged to the living of Harwich, has
been overwhelmed;<a name="FNanchor_412" id="FNanchor_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a> and in the year 1820 there was a considerable
space between the battery at Harwich, built in the beginning of the
present century, and the sea; part of the fortification had been swept
away in 1829, and the rest then overhung the water.</p>

<p>At Walton Naze, in the same county, the cliffs, composed of London
clay, capped by the shelly sands of the crag, reach the height of about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
100 feet, and are annually undermined by the waves. The old churchyard
of Walton has been washed away, and the cliffs to the south are
constantly disappearing.</p>

<p><i>Kent.&mdash;Isle of Sheppey.</i>&mdash;On the coast bounding the estuary of the
Thames, there are numerous examples both of the gain and loss of land.
The Isle of Sheppey, which is now about six miles long by four in
breadth, is composed of London clay. The cliffs on the north, which
are from sixty to eighty feet high, decay rapidly, fifty acres having been
lost in twenty years, between 1810 and 1830. The church at Minster,
now near the coast, is said to have been in the middle of the island in
1780; and if the present rate of destruction should continue, we might
calculate the period, and that not a very remote one, when the whole
island will be annihilated. On the coast of the mainland, to the east of
Sheppey, is Herne Bay: a place still retaining the name of a bay, although
it is no longer appropriate, as the waves and currents have
swept away the ancient headlands. There was formerly a small promontory
in the line of the shoals where the present pier is built, by which
the larger bay was divided into two, called the Upper and Lower.<a name="FNanchor_413" id="FNanchor_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><p class="center2">Fig. 33.</p><a name="f33" id="f33"></a><img src="images/f33.jpg" width="550" height="380" alt="View of Reculver Church, taken in the year 1781." title="" />

<p class="center2">1. Isle of Sheppey. 2. Ancient chapel now destroyed. The cottage between this chapel and the
cliff was demolished by the sea, in 1782.</p>

<p>Still farther east stands the church of Reculver, upon a cliff composed
of clay and sand, about twenty-five feet high. Reculver (Regulvium)
was an important military station in the time of the Romans, and appears,
from Leland's account, to have been, so late as Henry VIII.'s
reign, nearly one mile distant from the sea. In the "Gentleman's Magazine,"
there is a view of it, taken in 1781, which still represents a considerable
space as intervening between the north wall of the churchyard
and the cliff.<a name="FNanchor_414" id="FNanchor_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a> Sometime before the year 1780, the waves had reached
the site of the ancient Roman camp or fortification, the walls of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
had continued for several years after they were undermined to overhang
the sea, being firmly cemented into one mass. They were eighty yards
nearer the sea than the church, and they are spoken of in the "Topographica
Britannica," in the year 1780, as having recently fallen down.
In 1804, part of the churchyard with some adjoining houses was washed
away, and the ancient church, with its two spires, was dismantled and
abandoned as a place of worship, but kept in repair as a landmark well
known to mariners. I visited the spot in June, 1851, and saw human
bones and part of a wooden coffin projecting from the cliff, near the
top. The whole building would probably have been swept away long
ere this, had not the force of the waves been checked by an artificial
causeway of stones and large wooden piles driven into the sands on the
beach to break the force of the waves.</p>

<p><i>Isle of Thanet.</i>&mdash;The isle of Thanet was, in the time of the Romans,
separated from the rest of Kent by a navigable channel, through which
the Roman fleets sailed on their way to and from London. Bede describes
this small estuary as being, in the beginning of the eighth
century, three furlongs in breadth; and it is supposed that it began to
grow shallow about the period of the Norman conquest. It was so far
silted up in the year 1485, that an act was then obtained to build a
bridge across it; and it has since become marsh land with small streams
running through it. On the coast, Bedlam Farm, belonging to the
hospital of that name, lost eight acres in the twenty years preceding
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
1830, the land being composed of chalk from forty to fifty feet above
the level of the sea. It has been computed that the average waste of
the cliff between the North Foreland and the Reculvers, a distance of
about eleven miles, is not less than two feet per annum. The chalk
cliffs on the south of Thanet, between Ramsgate and Pegwell Bay, have
on an average lost three feet per annum for the last ten years (preceding
1830).</p>

<p><i>Goodwin Sands.</i>&mdash;The Goodwin Sands lie opposite this part of the
Kentish coast. They are about ten miles in length, and are in some
parts three, and in others seven, miles distant from the shore; and, for
a certain space, are laid bare at low water. That they are a remnant of
land, and not "a mere accumulation of sea sand," as Rennell imagined,<a name="FNanchor_415" id="FNanchor_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a>
may be presumed from the fact that, when the erection of a lighthouse
on this shoal was in contemplation by the Trinity Board in the year
1817, it was found, by borings, that the bank consisted of fifteen feet
of sand, resting on blue clay; and, by subsequent borings, the subjacent
chalk has been reached. An obscure tradition has come down to us,
that the estates of Earl Goodwin, the father of Harold, who died in the
year 1053, were situated here, and some have conjectured that they
were overwhelmed by the flood mentioned in the Saxon chronicle, <i>sub
anno 1099</i>. The last remains of an island, consisting, like Sheppey, of
clay, may perhaps have been carried away about that time.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><p class="center2">Fig. 35.</p><a name="f35" id="f35"></a><img src="images/f35.png" width="500" height="257" alt="Shakspeare's Cliff in 1836, seen from the northeast." title="" />

<p class="center2">Shakspeare's Cliff in 1836, seen from the northeast.</p></div>

<p>There are other records of waste in the county of Kent, as at Deal;
and at Dover, where Shakspeare's Cliff, composed entirely of chalk, has
suffered greatly, and continually diminishes in height, the slope of the
hill being towards the land. (See <a href="#f35">fig. 35</a>.) There was an immense
landslip from this cliff in 1810, by which Dover was shaken as if by an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span>
earthquake, and a still greater one in 1772.<a name="FNanchor_416" id="FNanchor_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> We may suppose, therefore,
that the view from the top of the precipice in the year 1600, when
the tragedy of King Lear was written, was more "fearful and dizzy"
than it is now. The best antiquarian authorities are agreed, that Dover
Harbor was formerly an estuary, the sea flowing up a valley between
the chalk hills. The remains found in different excavations confirm the
description of the spot given by C&aelig;sar and Antoninus, and there is
clear historical evidence to prove that at an early period there was no
shingle at all at Dover.<a name="FNanchor_417" id="FNanchor_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a></p>

<p><i>Straits of Dover.</i>&mdash;In proceeding from the northern parts of the
German Ocean towards the Straits of Dover, the water becomes gradually
more shallow, so that, in the distance of about two hundred
leagues, we pass from a depth of 120 to that of 58, 38, 18, and even
less than 2 fathoms. The shallowest part follows a line drawn between
Romney Marsh and Boulogne. From this point the English Channel
again deepens progressively as we proceed westward, so that the Straits
of Dover may be said to part two seas.<a name="FNanchor_418" id="FNanchor_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a></p>

<p>Whether England was formerly united with France has often been
a favorite subject of speculation. So early as 1605 our countryman
Verstegan, in his "Antiquities of the English Nation," observed that
many preceding writers had maintained this opinion, but without supporting
it by any weighty reasons. He accordingly endeavors himself
to confirm it by various arguments, the principal of which are, first, the
proximity and identity of the composition of the opposite cliffs and
shores of Albion and Gallia, which, whether flat and sandy, or steep
and chalky, correspond exactly with each other; secondly the occurrence
of a submarine ridge, called "our Lady's Sand," extending from
shore to shore at no great depth, and which, from its composition,
appears to be the original basis of the isthmus; thirdly, the identity of
the noxious animals in France and England, which could neither have
swum across, nor have been introduced by man. Thus no one, he says,
would have imported wolves, therefore "these wicked beasts did of
themselves pass over." He supposes the ancient isthmus to have been
about six English miles in breadth, composed entirely of chalk and flint,
and in some places of no great height above the sea-level. The operation
of the waves and tides, he says, would have been more powerful
when the straits were narrower, and even now they are destroying cliffs
composed of similar materials. He suggests the possible co-operation
of earthquakes; and when we consider how many submarine forests
skirt the southern and eastern shores of England, and that there are
raised beaches at many points above the sea-level, containing fossil
shells of recent species, it seems reasonable to suppose that such upward
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>
now in progress in Sweden and Greenland, may have greatly assisted the
denuding force of "the ocean stream," &#928;&#959;&#964;&#945;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#959; &#956;&#949;&#947;&#945; &#963;&#952;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#937;&#967;&#949;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#964;&#959;.</p>

<p><i>Folkstone.</i>&mdash;At Folkstone, the sea undermines the chalk and subjacent
strata. About the year 1716 there was a remarkable sinking of a
tract of land near the sea, so that houses became visible from certain
points at sea, and from particular spots on the sea cliffs, from whence
they could not be seen previously. In the description of this subsidence
in the Phil. Trans. 1716, it is said, "that the land consisted of a
solid stony mass (chalk), resting on wet clay (gault), so that it slid
forwards towards the sea, just as a ship is launched on tallowed planks."
It is also stated that, within the memory of persons then living, the
cliff there had been washed away to the extent of ten rods.</p>

<p>Encroachments of the sea at Hythe are also on record; but between
this point and Rye there has been a gain of land within the times of
history; the rich level tract called Romney Marsh, or Dungeness, about
ten miles in width and five in breadth, and formed of silt, having received
great accession. It has been necessary, however, to protect it
from the sea, from the earliest periods, by embankments, the towns of
Lydd and Romney being the only parts of the marsh above the level of
the highest tides.<a name="FNanchor_419" id="FNanchor_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a> Mr. Redman has cited numerous old charts and
trustworthy authorities to prove that the average annual increase of the
promontory of shingle called Dungeness amounted for two centuries,
previous to 1844, to nearly six yards. Its progress, however, has
fluctuated during that period; for between 1689 and 1794, a term of
105 years, the rate was as much as 8-1/4 yards per annum.<a name="FNanchor_420" id="FNanchor_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a> It is ascertained
that the shingle is derived from the westward. Whether the
pebbles are stopped by the meeting of the tide from the north flowing
through the Straits of Dover, with that which comes up the Channel
from the west, as was formerly held, or by the check given to the tidal
current by the waters of the Rother, as some maintain, is still a disputed
question.</p>

<p>Rye, situated to the south of Romney Marsh, was once destroyed by
the sea, but it is now two miles distant from it. The neighboring town
of Winchelsea was destroyed in the reign of Edward I., the mouth of
the Rother stopped up, and the river diverted into another channel.
In its old bed, an ancient vessel, apparently a Dutch merchantman,
was found about the year 1824. It was built entirely of oak, and much
blackened.<a name="FNanchor_421" id="FNanchor_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a> Large quantities of hazel-nuts, peat, and wood are found
in digging in Romney Marsh.</p>

<p><i>South coast of England.</i>&mdash;Westward of Hastings, or of St. Leonard's,
the shore line has been giving way as far as Pevensey Bay, where formerly
there existed a haven now entirely blocked up by shingle. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
degradation has equalled for a series of years seven feet per annum in
some places, and several martello towers had in consequence, before
1851, been removed by the Ordnance.<a name="FNanchor_422" id="FNanchor_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a> At the promontory of Beachy
Head a mass of chalk, three hundred feet in length, and from seventy
to eighty in breadth, fell in the year 1813 with a tremendous crash;
and similar slips have since been frequent.<a name="FNanchor_423" id="FNanchor_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a></p>

<p>About a mile to the west of the town of Newhaven, the remains of an
ancient intrenchment are seen on the brow of Castle Hill. This earthwork,
supposed to be Roman, was evidently once of considerable extent
and of an oval form, but the greater part has been cut away by the sea.
The cliffs, which are undermined here, are high; more than one hundred
feet of chalk being covered by tertiary clay and sand, from sixty to
seventy feet in thickness. In a few centuries the last vestiges of the
plastic clay formation on the southern borders of the chalk of the South
Downs on this coast will probably be annihilated, and future geologists
will learn, from historical documents, the ancient geographical boundaries
of this group of strata in that direction. On the opposite side of the
estuary of the Ouse, on the east of Newhaven harbor, a bed of shingle,
composed of chalk flints derived from the waste of the adjoining cliffs,
had accumulated at Seaford for several centuries. In the great storm
of November, 1824, this bank was entirely swept away, and the town
of Seaford inundated. Another great beach of shingle is now forming
from fresh materials.</p>

<p>The whole coast of Sussex has been incessantly encroached upon by
the sea from time immemorial; and, although sudden inundations only,
which overwhelmed fertile or inhabited tracts, are noticed in history, the
records attest an extraordinary amount of loss. During a period of no
more than eighty years, there are notices of about <i>twenty</i> inroads, in
which tracts of land of from twenty to <i>four hundred acres</i> in extent were
overwhelmed at once, the value of the tithes being mentioned in the
Taxatio Ecclesiastica.<a name="FNanchor_424" id="FNanchor_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> In the reign of Elizabeth, the town of Brighton
was situated on that tract where the chain pier now extends into the sea.
In the year 1665, twenty-two tenements had been destroyed under the
cliff. At that period there still remained under the cliff 113 tenements,
the whole of which were overwhelmed in 1703 and 1705. No traces of
the ancient town are now perceptible, yet there is evidence that the sea
has merely resumed its ancient position at the base of the cliffs, the site
of the whole town having been merely a beach abandoned by the ocean
for ages.</p>

<p><i>Hampshire.&mdash;Isle of Wight.</i>&mdash;It would be endless to allude to all
the localities on the Sussex and Hampshire coasts where the land has
given way; but I may point out the relation which the geological structure
of the Isle of Wight bears to its present shape, as attesting that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
coast owes its outline to the continued action of the sea. Through the
middle of the island runs a high ridge of chalk strata, in a vertical position,
and in a direction east and west. This chalk forms the projecting
promontory of Culver Cliff on the east, and of the Needles on the west;
while Sandown Bay on the one side, and Compton Bay on the other,
have been hollowed out of the softer sands and argillaceous strata, which
are inferior, in geological position, to the chalk.</p>

<p>The same phenomena are repeated in the Isle of Purbeck, where the
line of vertical chalk forms the projecting promontory of Handfast
Point; and Swanage Bay marks the deep excavation made by the waves
in the softer strata, corresponding to those of Sandown Bay.</p>

<p><i>Hurst Castle bank&mdash;progressive motion of sea beaches.</i>&mdash;Although the
loose pebbles and grains of sand composing any given line of sea-beach
are carried sometimes one way, sometimes another, they have, nevertheless,
an ultimate motion in one particular direction.<a name="FNanchor_425" id="FNanchor_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a> Their progress,
for example, on the south coast of England, is from west to east, which
is owing partly to the action of the waves driven eastwards by the prevailing
wind, and partly to the current, or the motion of the general
body of water caused by the tides and winds. The force of the waves
gives motion to pebbles which the velocity of the currents alone would
be unable to carry forwards; but as the pebbles are finally reduced to
sand or mud, by continual attrition, they are brought within the influence
of a current; and this cause must determine the course which the main
body of matter derived from wasting cliffs will eventually take.</p>

<p>It appears, from the observations of Mr. Palmer and others, that if
a pier or groin be erected anywhere on our southern or southeastern
coast to stop the progress of the beach, a heap of shingle soon collects
on the western side of such artificial barriers. The pebbles continue to
accumulate till they rise as high as the pier or groin, after which they
pour over in great numbers during heavy gales.<a name="FNanchor_426" id="FNanchor_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></p>

<p>The western entrance of the Channel, called the Solent, is crossed for
more than two-thirds of its width by the shingle-bank of Hurst Castle,
which is about two miles long, seventy yards broad, and twelve feet
high, presenting an inclined plane to the west. This singular bar consists
of a bed of rounded chalk flints, resting on a submarine argillaceous
base. The flints and a few other pebbles, intermixed, are derived from
the waste of Hordwell, and other cliffs to the westward, where tertiary
strata, capped with a covering of broken chalk flints, from five to fifty
feet thick, are rapidly undermined. In the great storm of November,
1824, this bank of shingle was moved bodily forwards for forty yards
towards the northeast; and certain piles, which served to mark the
boundaries of two manors, were found after the storm on the opposite
side of the bar. At the same time many acres of pasture land were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
covered by shingle, on the farm of Westover, near Lymington. But the
bar was soon restored in its old position by pebbles drifted from the
west; and it appears from ancient maps that it has preserved the same
general outline and position for centuries.<a name="FNanchor_427" id="FNanchor_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a></p>

<p>Mr. Austen remarks that, as a general rule, it is only when high
tides concur with a gale of wind, that the sea reaches the base of cliffs
so as to undermine them and throw down earth and stone. But the
waves are perpetually employed in abrading and fashioning the materials
already strewed over the beach. Much of the gravel and shingle
is always travelling up and down, between high-water mark and a slight
depth below the level of the lowest tides, and occasionally the materials
are swept away and carried into deeper water. Owing to these movements
every portion of our southern coast may be seen at one time or
other in the condition of bare rock. Yet other beds of sand and shingle
soon collect, and, although composed of new materials, invariably exhibit
on the same spots precisely similar characters.<a name="FNanchor_428" id="FNanchor_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></p>

<p>The cliffs between Hurst Shingle Bar and Christchurch are undermined
continually, the sea having often encroached for a series of years
at the rate of a yard annually. Within the memory of persons now
living, it has been necessary thrice to remove the coast-road farther inland.
The tradition, therefore, is probably true, that the church of
Hordwell was once in the middle of that parish, although now (1830)
very near the sea. The promontory of Christchurch Head gives
way slowly. It is the only point between Lymington and Poole Harbor,
in Dorsetshire, where any hard stony masses occur in the cliffs.
Five layers of large ferruginous concretions, somewhat like the septaria
of the London clay, have occasioned a resistance at this point, to which
we may ascribe this headland. In the mean time, the waves have cut
deeply into the soft sands and loam of Poole Bay; and, after severe
frosts, great landslips take place, which by degrees become enlarged
into narrow ravines, or chines, as they are called, with vertical sides.
One of these chines, near Boscomb, has been deepened twenty feet
within a few years. At the head of each there is a spring, the waters
of which have been chiefly instrumental in producing these narrow excavations,
which are sometimes from 100 to 150 feet deep.</p>

<p><i>Isle of Portland.</i>&mdash;The peninsulas of Purbeck and Portland are continually
wasting away. In the latter, the soft argillaceous substratum
(Kimmeridge clay) hastens the dilapidation of the superincumbent mass
of limestone.</p>

<p>In 1655 the cliffs adjoining the principal quarries in Portland gave
way to the extent of one hundred yards, and fell into the sea; and in
December, 1734, a slide to the extent of 150 yards occurred on the
east side of the isle, by which several skeletons buried between slabs of
stone, were discovered. But a much more memorable occurrence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
this nature, in 1792, occasioned probably by the undermining of the cliffs,
is thus described in Hutchin's History of Dorsetshire:&mdash;"Early in the
morning the road was observed to crack: this continued increasing, and
before two o'clock the ground had sunk several feet, and was in one
continued motion, but attended with no other noise than what was occasioned
by the separation of the roots and brambles, and now and then a
falling rock. At night it seemed to stop a little, but soon moved again;
and, before morning, the ground from the top of the cliff to the waterside
had sunk in some places fifty feet perpendicular. The extent of
ground that moved was about <i>a mile and a quarter</i> from north to south,
and 600 yards from east to west."</p>

<p><i>Formation of the Chesil Bank.</i>&mdash;Portland is connected with the mainland
by the Chesil Bank, a ridge of shingle about seventeen miles in
length, and, in most places, nearly a quarter of a mile in breadth. The
pebbles forming this immense barrier are chiefly siliceous, all loosely
thrown together, and rising to the height of from twenty to thirty feet
above the ordinary high-water mark; and at the southeastern end,
which is nearest the Isle of Portland, where the pebbles are largest,
forty feet. The fundamental rocks whereon the shingle rests are found
at the depth of a few yards only below the level of the sea. The formation
of that part of the bar which attaches Portland to the mainland
may have been due to an original shoal or reef, or to the set of the
tides in the narrow channel, by which the course of the pebbles, which
are always coming from the west, has been arrested. It is a singular
fact that, throughout the Chesil Bank, the pebbles increase gradually in
size as we proceed southeastward, or as we go farther from the quarter
which supplied them. Had the case been reversed, we should naturally
have attributed the circumstance to the constant wearing down of the
pebbles by friction, as they are rolled along a beach seventeen miles in
length. But the true explanation of the phenomenon is doubtless this:
the tidal current runs strongest from west to east, and its power is
greater in the more open channel or farther from the land. In other
words its force increases southwards, and as the direction of the bank
is from northwest to southeast, the size of the masses coming from
the westward and thrown ashore must always be largest where the
motion of the water is most violent. Colonel Reid states that all calcareous
stones rolled along from the west are soon ground into sand,
and in this form they pass round Portland Island.<a name="FNanchor_429" id="FNanchor_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a></p>

<p>The storm of 1824 burst over the Chesil Bank with great fury, and
the village of Chesilton, built upon its southern extremity, was overwhelmed,
with many of the inhabitants. The same storm carried away
part of the Breakwater at Plymouth, and huge masses of rock, from
two to five tons in weight, were lifted from the bottom of the weather
side, and rolled fairly to the top of the pile. One block of limestone,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
weighing seven tons, was washed round the western extremity of the
Breakwater, and carried 150 feet.<a name="FNanchor_430" id="FNanchor_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> The propelling power is derived in
these cases from the breaking of the waves, which run fastest in shallow
water, and for a short space far exceed the most rapid currents in swiftness.
It was in the same month, and also during a spring-tide, that a
great flood is mentioned on the coasts of England, in the year 1099.
Florence of Worcester says, "On the third day of the nones of Nov.
1099, the sea came out upon the shore and buried towns and men very
many, and oxen and sheep innumerable." We also read in the Saxon
Chronicle, for the year 1099, "This year eke on St. Martin's mass day,
the 11th of Novembre, sprung up so much of the sea flood, and so
myckle harm did, as no man minded that it ever afore did, and there
was the ylk day a new moon."</p>

<p>South of the Bill, or southern point of Portland, is a remarkable
shoal in the channel at the depth of seven fathoms, called "the Shambles,"
consisting entirely of rolled and broken shells of Purpura lapillus,
Mytilus edulis, and other species now living. This mass of light materials
is always in motion, varying in height from day to day, and yet
the shoal remains constant.</p>

<p><i>Dorsetshire.&mdash;Devonshire.</i>&mdash;At Lyme Regis, in Dorsetshire, the
"Church Cliffs," as they are called, consisting of lias about one hundred
feet in height, gradually fell away at the rate of one yard a year,
from 1800 to 1829.<a name="FNanchor_431" id="FNanchor_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a></p>

<p>An extraordinary landslip occurred on the 24th of December, 1839,
on the coast between Lyme Regis and Axmouth, which has been described
by the Rev. W. D. Conybeare, to whose kindness I am indebted
for the accompanying section, <a href="#f36">fig. 36</a>. The tract of downs ranging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
there along the coast is capped by chalk (<i>h</i>), which rests on sandstone,
alternating with chert (<i>i</i>), beneath which is more than 100 feet of loose
sand (<i>k</i>), with concretions at the bottom, and belonging like <i>i</i> to the
green-sand formation; the whole of the above masses, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>, <i>k</i>, reposing
on retentive beds of clay (<i>l</i>), belonging to the lias, which shelves towards
the sea. Numerous springs issuing from the loose sand (<i>k</i>), have
gradually removed portions of it, and thus undermined the superstratum,
so as to have caused subsidences at former times, and to have produced
a line of undercliff between D and E. In 1839 an excessively
wet season had saturated all the rocks with moisture, so as to increase
the weight of the incumbent mass, from which the support had already
been withdrawn by the action of springs. Thus the superstrata were
precipitated into hollows prepared for them, and the adjacent masses of
partially undermined rock, to which the movement was communicated,
were made to slide down on a slippery basis of watery sand towards the
sea. These causes gave rise to a convulsion, which began on the morning
of the 24th of December, with a crashing noise; and, on the evening
of the same day, fissures were seen opening in the ground, and
the walls of tenements rending and sinking, until a deep chasm or
ravine, B, was formed, extending nearly three-quarters of a mile in
length, with a depth of from 100 to 150 feet, and a breadth exceeding
240 feet. At the bottom of this deep gulf lie fragments of the original
surface thrown together in the wildest confusion. In consequence
of lateral movements, the tract intervening between the new fissure and
the sea, including the ancient undercliff, was fractured, and the whole
line of sea-cliff carried bodily forwards for many yards. "A remarkable
pyramidal crag, F, off Culverhole Point, which lately formed a distinguishing
landmark, has sunk from a height of about seventy to twenty
feet, and the main cliff, E, before more than fifty feet distant from
this insulated crag, is now brought almost close to it. This motion of
the sea-cliff has produced a farther effect, which may rank among the
most striking phenomena of this catastrophe. The lateral pressure of
the descending rocks has urged the neighboring strata, extending beneath
the shingle of the shore, by their state of unnatural condensation,
to burst upwards in a line parallel to the coast&mdash;thus an elevated
ridge, G, more than a mile in length, and rising more than forty feet,
covered by a confused assemblage of broken strata, and immense blocks
of rock, invested with sea-weed and corallines, and scattered over with
shells and star-fish, and other productions of the deep, forms an extended
reef in front of the present range of cliffs."<a name="FNanchor_432" id="FNanchor_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>A full account of this remarkable landslip, with a plan, sections, and
many fine illustrative drawings, was published by Messrs. Conybeare
and Buckland,<a name="FNanchor_433" id="FNanchor_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a> from one of which the annexed cut has been reduced,

<p><i>Cornwall.</i>&mdash;Near Penzance, in Cornwall, there is a projecting tongue
of land, called the "Green," formed of granitic sand, from which more
than thirty acres of pasture land have been gradually swept away, in
the course of the last two or three centuries.<a name="FNanchor_434" id="FNanchor_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> It is also said that St.
Michael's Mount, now an insular rock, was formerly situated in a wood,
several miles from the sea; and its old Cornish name (Caraclowse in
Cowse) signifies, according to Carew, the Hoar Rock in the wood.<a name="FNanchor_435" id="FNanchor_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a>
Between the Mount and Newlyn there is seen under the sand, black
vegetable mould, full of hazel-nuts, and the branches, leaves, roots, and
trunks of forest-trees, all of indigenous species. This stratum has been
traced seaward as far as the ebb permits, and many proofs of a submerged
vegetable accumulation, with stumps of trees in the position in
which they grew, have been traced, says Sir Henry De la Beche, round
the shores of Devon, Cornwall, and Western Somerset. The facts not
only indicate a change in the relative level of the sea and land, since
the species of animals and plants were the same as those now living in
this district; but, what is very remarkable, there seems evidence of the
submergence having been effected, in part at least, since the country
was inhabited by man.<a name="FNanchor_436" id="FNanchor_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a></p>

<p>A submarine forest occurring at the mouth of the Parret in Somersetshire,
on the south side of the Bristol Channel, was described by
Mr. L. Horner, in 1815, and its position attributed to subsidence. A
bed of peat is there seen below the level of the sea, and the trunks of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
large trees, such as the oak and yew, having their roots still diverging
as they grew, and fixed in blue clay.<a name="FNanchor_437" id="FNanchor_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a></p>

<p><i>Tradition of loss of land in Cornwall.</i>&mdash;The oldest historians mention
a tradition in Cornwall, of the submersion of the Lionnesse, a country
said to have stretched from the Land's End to the Scilly Islands.
The tract, if it existed, must have been thirty miles in length, and perhaps
ten in breadth. The land now remaining on either side is from
two hundred to three hundred feet high; the intervening sea about
three hundred feet deep. Although there is no authentic evidence for
this romantic tale, it probably originated in some former inroads of the
Atlantic, accompanying, perhaps, a subsidence of land on this coast.<a name="FNanchor_438" id="FNanchor_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></p>

<p><i>West coast of England.</i>&mdash;Having now brought together an ample
body of proofs of the destructive operations of the waves, tides, and
currents, on our eastern and southern shores, it will be unnecessary to
enter into details of changes on the western coast, for they present
merely a repetition of the same phenomena, and in general on an inferior
scale. On the borders of the estuary of the Severn the flats of
Somersetshire and Gloucestershire have received enormous accessions,
while, on the other hand, the coast of Cheshire, between the rivers
Mersey and Dee, has lost, since the year 1764, many hundred yards,
and some affirm more than half a mile, by the advance of the sea upon
the abrupt cliffs of red clay and marls. Within the period above mentioned
several lighthouses have been successively abandoned.<a name="FNanchor_439" id="FNanchor_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a> There
are traditions in Pembrokeshire<a name="FNanchor_440" id="FNanchor_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> and Cardiganshire<a name="FNanchor_441" id="FNanchor_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> of far greater losses
of territory than that which the Lionnesse tale of Cornwall pretends to
commemorate. They are all important, as demonstrating that the
earliest inhabitants were familiar with the phenomenon of incursions of
the sea.</p>

<p><i>Loss of land on the coast of France.</i>&mdash;The French coast, particularly
that part of Brittany, where the tides rise to an extraordinary height, is
the constant prey of the waves. In the ninth century many villages
and woods are reported to have been carried away, the coast undergoing
great change, whereby the hill of St. Michael was detached from
the mainland. The parish of Bourgneuf, and several others in that
neighborhood, were overflowed in the year 1500. In 1735, during a
great storm, the ruins of Palnel were seen uncovered in the sea.<a name="FNanchor_442" id="FNanchor_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a></p>

<p><i>Inroads of the sea at the mouths of the Rhine.</i>&mdash;The line of British
coast considered in the preceding chapter offered no example of the
conflict of two great antagonist forces; the influx, on the one hand, of
a river draining a large continent, and, on the other, the action of the
waves, tides, and currents of the ocean. But when we pass over by
the Straits of Dover to the Continent, and proceed northeastwards, we
find an admirable illustration of such a contest, where the ocean and the
Rhine are opposed to each other, each disputing the ground now occupied
by Holland; the one striving to shape out an estuary, the other
to form a delta. There was evidently a period when the river obtained
the ascendancy, when the shape and perhaps the relative level of the
coast and set of the tides were very different; but for the last two
thousand years, during which man has witnessed and actively participated
in the struggle, the result has been in favor of the ocean; the
area of the whole territory having become more and more circumscribed;
natural and artificial barriers having given away, one after another;
and many hundred thousand human beings having perished in the
waves.</p>

<p><i>Changes in the arms of the Rhine.</i>&mdash;The Rhine, after flowing from
the Grison Alps, copiously charged with sediment, first purifies itself in
the Lake of Constance, where a large delta is formed; then swelled by
the Aar and numerous other tributaries, it flows for more than six hundred
miles towards the north; when, entering a low tract, it divides into
two arms, about ten miles northeast of Cleves,&mdash;a point which must
therefore be considered the head of its delta. (See *, map, <a href="#f38">fig. 38</a>.) In
speaking of the delta, I do not mean to assume that all that part of
Holland which is comprised within the several arms of the Rhine can
be called a delta in the strictest sense of the term; because some portion
of the country thus circumscribed, as, for example, a part of Gelderland
and Utrecht, consists of strata which may have been deposited
in the sea before the Rhine existed. These older tracts may either have
been raised like the Ullah Bund in Cutch, during the period when the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
sediment of the Rhine was converting a part of the sea into land, or
they may have constituted islands previously.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 38.</span><a name="f38" id="f38"></a><img src="images/f38.png" width="600" height="470" alt="The dark tint between Antwerp and Nieuport" title="" />

<p class="small4">The dark tint between Antwerp and Nieuport, represents part of the Netherlands which was
land in the time of the Romans, then overflowed by the sea before and during the 5th century,
and afterwards reconverted into land.</p></div>

<p>When the river divides north of Cleves, the left arm takes the name
of the Waal; and the right, retaining that of the Rhine, is connected, a
little farther to the north, by an artificial canal with the river Yssel.
The Rhine then flowing westward divides again southeast of Utrecht,
and from this point it takes the name of the Leck, a name which was
given to distinguish it from the northern arm called the old Rhine,
which was sanded up until the year 1825, when a channel was cut for
it, by which it now enters the sea at Catwyck. It is common, in all
great deltas, that the principal channels of discharge should shift from
time to time, but in Holland so many magnificent canals have been
constructed, and have so diverted, from time to time, the course of the
waters, that the geographical changes in this delta are endless, and
their history, since the Roman era, forms a complicated topic of antiquarian
research. The present head of the delta is about forty geographical
miles from the nearest part of the gulf called the Zuyder Zee,
and more than twice that distance from the general coast-line. The
present head of the delta of the Nile is about 80 or 90 geographical
miles from the sea; that of the Ganges, as before stated, 220; and
that of the Mississippi about 180, reckoning from the point where the
Atchafalaya branches off to the extremity of the new tongue of land in
the Gulf of Mexico. But the comparative distance between the heads
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
of deltas and the sea affords no positive data for estimating the relative
magnitude of the alluvial tracts formed by their respective rivers, for
the ramifications depend on many varying and temporary circumstances,
and the area over which they extend does not hold any constant
proportion to the volume of water in the river.</p>

<p>The Rhine therefore has at present three mouths. About two-thirds
of its waters flow to the sea by the Waal, and the remainder is carried
partly to the Zuyder Zee by the Yssel, and partly to the ocean by the
Leck. As the whole coast to the south as far as Ostend, and on the
north to the entrance of the Baltic, has, with few exceptions, from time
immemorial, yielded to the force of the waves, it is evident that the
common delta of the Rhine, Meuse, and Scheldt, for these three rivers
may all be considered as discharging their waters into the same part of
the sea, would, if its advance had not been checked, have become extremely
prominent; and even if it had remained stationary, would long
ere this have projected far beyond the rounded outline of the coast, like
that strip of land already described at the mouth of the Mississippi.
But we find, on the contrary, that the islands which skirt the coast
have not only lessened in size, but in number also, while great bays
have been formed in the interior by incursions of the sea.</p>

<p>In order to explain the incessant advance of the ocean on the shores
and inland country of Holland, M. E. de Beaumont has suggested that
there has in all probability been a general depression or sinking of the
land below its former level over a wide area. Such a change of level
would enable the sea to break through the ancient line of sand-banks
and islands which protected the coast,&mdash;would lead to the enlargement
of bays, the formation of new estuaries, and ultimately to the entire
submergence of land. These views appear to be supported by the fact
that several peat-mosses of fresh-water origin now occur under the
level of the sea, especially on the site of the Zuyder Zee and Lake
Flevo, presently to be mentioned. Several excavations also made for
wells at Utrecht, Amsterdam, and Rotterdam have proved, that below
the level of the ocean, the soil near the coast consists of alternations of
sand with marine shells, and beds of peat and clay, which have been
traced to the depth of fifty feet and upwards.<a name="FNanchor_443" id="FNanchor_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a></p>

<p>I have said that the coast to the south as far as Ostend has given
way. This statement may at first seem opposed to the fact, that the
tract between Antwerp and Nieuport, shaded black in the annexed map
(<a href="#f38">fig. 38</a>), although now dry land, and supporting a large population,
has, within the historical period, been covered with the sea. This
region, however, consisted, in the time of the Romans, of woods,
marshes, and peat-mosses, protected from the ocean by a chain of
sandy dunes, which were afterwards broken through during storms,
especially in the fifth century. The waters of the sea during these
irruptions threw down upon the barren peat a horizontal bed of fertile
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span>
clay, which is in some places three yards thick, full of recent shells and
works of art. The inhabitants, by the aid of embankments and the
sand dunes of the coast, have succeeded, although not without frequent
disasters, in defending the soil thus raised by the marine deposit.<a name="FNanchor_444" id="FNanchor_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></p>

<p><i>Inroads of the Sea in Holland.</i>&mdash;If we pass to the northward of the
territory just alluded to, and cross the Scheldt, we find that between
the fourteenth and eighteenth centuries parts of the islands Walcheren
and Beveland were swept away, and several populous districts of Kadzand,
losses which far more than counterbalance the gain of land caused
by the sanding up of some pre-existing creeks. In 1658 the Island
Orisant was annihilated. One of the most memorable inroads of the
sea occurred in 1421, when the tide, pouring into the mouth of the
united Meuse and Waal, burst through a dam in the district between
Dort and Gertrudenberg, and overflowed seventy-two villages, forming
a large sheet of water called the Bies Bosch. (See map, <a href="#f38">fig. 38</a>.)
Thirty-five of the villages were irretrievably lost, and no vestige, even
of their ruins, was afterwards seen. The rest were redeemed, and the
site of the others, though still very generally represented on maps as
an estuary, has in fact been gradually filled up by alluvial deposits, and
had become in 1835, as I was informed by Professor Moll, an immense
plain, yielding abundant crops of hay, though still uninhabited. To
the north of the Meuse is a long line of shore covered with sand dunes,
where great encroachments have taken place from time to time, in consequence
chiefly of the prevalence of southeasterly winds, which blow
down the sands towards the sea. The church of Scheveningen, not far
from the Hague, was once in the middle of the village, and now stands
on the shore, half the place having been overwhelmed by the waves in
1570. Catwyck, once far from the sea, is now upon the shore; two
of its streets having been overflowed, and land torn away to the extent
of 200 yards, in 1719. It is only by the aid of embankments that
Petten, and several other places farther north, have been defended
against the sea.</p>

<p><i>Formation of the Zuyder Zee and Straits of Staveren.</i>&mdash;Still more
important are the changes which have taken place on the coast opposite
the right arm of the Rhine, or the Yssel, where the ocean has
burst through a large isthmus, and entered the inland lake Flevo,
which, in ancient times, was, according to Pomponius Mela, formed by
the overflowing of the Rhine over certain lowlands. It appears that,
in the time of Tacitus, there were several lakes on the present site of
the Zuyder Zee, between Friesland and Holland. The successive inroads
by which these and a great part of the adjoining territory, were
transformed into a great gulf, began about the commencement, and
were completed towards the close, of the thirteenth century. Alting
gives the following relation of the occurrence, drawn from manuscript
documents of contemporary inhabitants of the neighboring provinces.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
In the year 1205, the island now called Wieringen, to the south
of the Texel, was still a part of the mainland, but during several high
floods, of which the dates are given, ending in December, 1251, it was
separated from the continent. By subsequent incursions the sea consumed
great parts of the rich and populous isthmus, a low tract which
stretched on the north of Lake Flevo, between Staveren in Friesland
and Medemblick in Holland, till at length a breach was completed
about the year 1282, and afterwards widened. Great destruction of
land took place when the sea first broke in, and many towns were
swept away; but there was afterwards a reaction to a certain extent,
large tracts, at first submerged, having been gradually redeemed.
The new straits south of Staveren are more than half the width of
those of Dover, but are very shallow, the greatest depth not exceeding
two or three fathoms. The new bay is of a somewhat circular form,
and between <i>thirty</i> and <i>forty</i> miles in diameter. How much of this
space may formerly have been occupied by Lake Flevo is unknown.
(See map, <a href="#f38">fig. 38</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Destruction of islands.</i>&mdash;A series of islands stretching from the Texel
to the mouths of the Weser and Elbe are probably the last relics of a
tract once continuous. They have greatly diminished in size, and
have lost about a third of their number, since the time of Pliny; for
that naturalist counted twenty-three islands between the Texel and
Eider, whereas there are now only sixteen, including Heligoland and
Neuwerk.<a name="FNanchor_445" id="FNanchor_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> The island of Heligoland, at the mouth of the Elbe, consists
of a rock of red marl of the Keuper formation (of the Germans),
and is bounded by perpendicular red cliffs, above 200 feet high. Although,
according to some accounts, it has been greatly reduced in
size since the year 800, M. Wiebel assures us, that the ancient map by
Meyer cannot be depended upon, and that the island, according to the
description still extant by Adam of Bremen, was not much larger than
now, in the time of Charlemagne. On comparing the map made in
the year 1793 by the Danish engineer Wessel, the average encroachment
of the sea on the cliffs, between that period and the year 1848
(or about half a century), did not amount to more than three feet.<a name="FNanchor_446" id="FNanchor_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a>
On the other hand, some few islands have extended their bounds in
one direction, or become connected with others, by the sanding-up
of channels; but even these, like Juist, have generally given way as
much on the north towards the sea as they have gained on the south,
or land side.</p>

<p><i>The Dollart formed.</i>&mdash;While the delta of the Rhine has suffered so
materially from the movements of the ocean, it can hardly be supposed
that minor rivers on the same coast should have been permitted to extend
their deltas. It appears that in the time of the Romans there
was an alluvial plain of great fertility, where the Ems entered the sea
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
by three arms. This low country stretched between Groningen and
Friesland, and sent out a peninsula to the northeast towards Emden. A
flood in 1277 first destroyed part of the peninsula. Other inundations
followed at different periods throughout the fifteenth century. In
1507, a part only of Torum, a considerable town, remained standing;
and in spite of the erection of dams, the remainder of that place, together
with market-towns, villages, and monasteries, to the number of
fifty, were finally overwhelmed. The new gulf, which was called the
Dollart, although small in comparison to the Zuyder Zee, occupied no
less than six square miles at first; but part of this space was, in the
course of the two following centuries, again redeemed from the sea.
The small bay of Leybucht, farther north, was formed in a similar manner
in the thirteenth century; and the bay of Harlbucht in the middle
of the sixteenth. Both of these have since been partially reconverted
into dry land. Another new estuary, called the Gulf of Jahde, near
the mouth of the Weser, scarcely inferior in size to the Dollart, has
been gradually hollowed out since the year 1016, between which era
and 1651 a space of about four square miles has been added to the
sea. The rivulet which now enters this inlet is very small; but
Arens conjectures that an arm of the Weser had once an outlet in
that direction.</p>

<p><i>Coast of Sleswick.</i>&mdash;Farther north we find so many records of waste
on the western coast of Sleswick, as to lead us to anticipate that, at no
distant period in the history of the physical geography of Europe, Jutland
may become an island, and the ocean may obtain a more direct
entrance into the Baltic. Indeed, the temporary insulation of the
northern extremity of Jutland has been affected no less than four times
within the records of history, the ocean having as often made a breach
through the bar of sand, which usually excludes it from the Lym Fiord.
This long frith is 120 miles in length including its windings, and communicates
at its eastern end with the Baltic. The last irruption of salt
water happened in 1824, and the fiord was still open in 1837, when
some vessels of thirty tons' burden passed through.</p>

<p>The Marsh islands between the rivers Elbe and Eider are mere banks,
like the lands formed of the "warp" in the Humber, protected by dikes.
Some of them, after having been inhabited with security for more than
ten centuries, have been suddenly overwhelmed. In this manner, in
1216, no less than ten thousand of the inhabitants of Eiderstede and
Ditmarsch perished; and on the 11th of October, 1634, the islands
and the whole coast, as far as Jutland, suffered by a dreadful deluge.</p>

<p><i>Destruction of Northstrand by the sea.</i>&mdash;Northstrand, up to the year
1240, was, with the islands Sylt and F&ouml;hr, so nearly connected with the
mainland as to appear a peninsula, and was called North Friesland, a
highly cultivated and populous district. It measured from nine to
eleven geographical miles from north to south, and six to eight from
east to west. In the above-mentioned year it was torn asunder from
the continent, and in part overwhelmed. The Isle of Northstrand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
thus formed, was, towards the end of the sixteenth century, only four
geographical miles in circumference, and was still celebrated for its
cultivation and numerous population. After many losses, it still contained
nine thousand inhabitants. At last, in the year 1634, on the
evening of the 11th of October, a flood passed over the whole island,
whereby 1300 houses, with many churches, were lost; fifty thousand
head of cattle perished, and above six thousand men. Three small
islets, one of them still called Northstrand, alone remained, which are
now continually wasting.</p>

<p>The redundancy of river water in the Baltic, especially during the
melting of ice and snow in spring, causes in general an outward current
through the channel called the Cattegat. But after a continuance of
northwesterly gales, especially during the height of the spring-tides, the
Atlantic rises, and pouring a flood of water into the Baltic, commits
dreadful devastations on the isles of the Danish Archipelago. This
current even acts, though with diminished force, as far eastward as the
vicinity of Dantzic.<a name="FNanchor_447" id="FNanchor_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a> Accounts written during the last ten centuries
attest the wearing down of promontories on the Danish coast, the deepening
of gulfs, the severing of peninsulas from the mainland, and the
waste of islands, while in several cases marsh land, defended for centuries
by dikes, has at last been overflowed, and thousands of the
inhabitants whelmed in the waves. Thus the island Barsoe, on the
coast of Sleswick, has lost, year after year, an acre at a time, and the
island Alsen suffers in like manner.</p>

<p><i>Cimbrian deluge.</i>&mdash;As we have already seen that during the flood
before mentioned, 6000 men and 50,000 head of cattle perished on
Northstrand on the western coast of Jutland, we are all well prepared
to find that this peninsula, the Cimbrica Chersonesus of the ancients,
has from a remote period been the theatre of like catastrophes. Accordingly,
Strabo records a story, although he treats it as an incredible
fiction, that, during a high tide, the ocean rose upon this coast so rapidly,
that men on horseback were scarcely able to escape.<a name="FNanchor_448" id="FNanchor_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> Florus,
alluding to the same tradition, says, "Cimbri, Teutoni, atque Tigurini,
ab extremis Galli&aelig; profugi, c&ugrave;m terras eorum inundasset Oceanus, novas
sedes toto orbe qu&aelig;rebant."<a name="FNanchor_449" id="FNanchor_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a> This event, commonly called the
"Cimbrian Deluge," is supposed to have happened about three centuries
before the Christian era; but it is not improbable that the principal
catastrophe was preceded and followed by many devastations like those
experienced in modern times on the islands and shores of Jutland, and
such calamities may well be conceived to have forced on the migration
of some maritime tribes.</p>

<p><i>Inroads of the sea on the eastern shores of North America.</i>&mdash;After so
many authentic details respecting the destruction of the coast in parts
of Europe best known, it will be unnecessary to multiply examples of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
analogous changes in more distant regions of the world. It must not,
however, be imagined that our own seas form any exception to the
general rule. Thus, for example, if we pass over to the eastern coast
of North America, where the tides rise, in the Bay of Fundy, to a great
elevation, we find many facts attesting the incessant demolition of land.
Cliffs, often several hundred feet high, composed of sandstone, red marl,
and other rocks, which border that bay and its numerous estuaries, are
perpetually undermined. The ruins of these cliffs are gradually carried,
in the form of mud, sand, and large boulders, into the Atlantic by powerful
currents, aided at certain seasons by drift ice, which forms along
the coast, and freezes round large stones.</p>

<p>At Cape May, on the north side of Delaware Bay, in the United
States, the encroachment of the sea was shown by observations made
consecutively for sixteen years, from 1804 to 1820, to average about
nine feet a year;<a name="FNanchor_450" id="FNanchor_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a> and at Sullivan's Island, which lies on the north
side of the entrance of the harbor of Charleston, in South Carolina,
the sea carried away a quarter of a mile of land in three years, ending
in 1786.<a name="FNanchor_451" id="FNanchor_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a></p>

<p><i>Tidal wave called "the Bore."</i>&mdash;Before concluding my remarks on
the action of the tides, I must not omit to mention the wave called "the
Bore," which is sometimes produced in a river where a large body of
water is made to rise suddenly, in consequence of the contraction of the
channel. This wave terminates abruptly on the inland side; because
the quantity of water contained in it is so great, and its motion so rapid,
that time is not allowed for the surface of the river to be immediately
raised by means of transmitted pressure. A tide wave thus rendered
abrupt has a close analogy, observes Mr. Whewell, to the waves which
curl over and break on a shelving shore.<a name="FNanchor_452" id="FNanchor_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a></p>

<p>The Bore which enters the Severn, where the phenomenon is of almost
daily occurrence, is sometimes nine feet high, and at spring-tides
rushes up the estuary with extraordinary rapidity. The finest example
which I have seen of this wave was at Nova Scotia,<a name="FNanchor_453" id="FNanchor_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> where the tide is
said to rise in some places seventy feet perpendicular, and to be the
highest in the world. In the large estuary of the Shubenacadie, which
connects with another estuary called the Basin of Mines, itself an embranchment
of the Bay of Fundy, a vast body of water comes rushing
up, with a roaring noise, into a long narrow channel, and while it is
ascending, has all the appearance of pouring down a slope as steep
as that of the celebrated rapids of the St. Lawrence. In picturesque
effect, however, it bears no comparison, for instead of the transparent
green water and snow-white foam of the St. Lawrence, the whole current
of the Shubenacadie is turbid and densely charged with red mud.
The same phenomenon is frequently witnessed in the principal branches
of the Ganges and in the Megna as before mentioned (p. 279). "In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">333</a></span>
the Hoogly," says Rennell, "the Bore commences at Hoogly Point, the
place where the river first contracts itself, and is perceptible above
Hoogly Town; and so quick is its motion, that it hardly employs four
hours in travelling from one to the other, though the distance is nearly
seventy miles. At Calcutta it sometimes occasions an instantaneous
rise of five feet; and both here, and in every other part of its track,
the boats, on its approach, immediately quit the shore, and make for
safety to the middle of the river. In the channels, between the islands
in the mouth of the Megna, the height of the Bore is said to exceed
twelve feet; and is so terrific in its appearance, and dangerous in its consequences,
that no boat will venture to pass at spring-tide."<a name="FNanchor_454" id="FNanchor_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> These
waves may sometimes cause inundations, undermine cliffs, and still
more frequently sweep away trees and land animals from low shores, so
that they may be carried down, and ultimately imbedded in fluviatile or
submarine deposits.</p>

<h6>CURRENTS IN INLAND LAKES AND SEAS.</h6>

<p>In such large bodies of water as the North American lakes, the continuance
of a strong wind in one direction often causes the elevation of
the water, and its accumulation on the leeward side; and while the
equilibrium is restoring itself, powerful currents are occasioned. In
October, 1833, a strong current in Lake Erie, caused partly by the set
of the waters towards the outlet of the lake, and partly by the prevailing
wind, burst a passage through the extensive peninsula called Long
Point, and soon excavated a channel more than nine feet deep and nine
hundred feet wide. Its width and depth have since increased, and a
new and costly pier has been erected; for it is hoped that this event will
permanently improve the navigation of Lake Erie for steamboats.<a name="FNanchor_455" id="FNanchor_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a> On
the opposite, or southern coast of this lake, in front of the town of Cleveland,
the degradation of the cliffs had been so rapid for several years
preceding a survey made in 1837, as to threaten many towns with demolition.<a name="FNanchor_456" id="FNanchor_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a>
In the Black Sea, also, although free from tides, we learn from
Pallas that there is a sufficiently strong current to undermine the cliffs
in many parts, and particularly in the Crimea.</p>

<p><i>Straits of Gibraltar.</i>&mdash;It is well known that a powerful current sets
constantly from the Atlantic into the Mediterranean, and its influence
extends along the whole southern borders of that sea, and even to the
shores of Asia Minor. Captain Smyth found, during his survey, that
the central current ran constantly at the rate of from three to six miles
an hour eastward into the Mediterranean, the body of water being three
miles and a half wide. But there are also two lateral currents&mdash;one on
the European, and one on the African side; each of them about two
miles and a half broad, and flowing at about the same rate as the central
stream. These lateral currents ebb and flow with the tide, setting alternately
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
into the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic. The excess of
water constantly flowing in is very great, and there is only one cause to
which this can be attributed, the loss of water in the Mediterranean by
evaporation. That the level of this sea should be considerably depressed
by this cause is quite conceivable, since we know that the winds
blowing from the shores of Africa are hot and dry; and hygrometrical
experiments recently made in Malta and other places, show that the
mean quantity of moisture in the air investing the Mediterranean is equal
only to one half of that in the atmosphere of England. The temperature
also of the great inland sea is upon an average higher, by 3&frac12;&deg; of Fahrenheit,
than the eastern part of the Atlantic Ocean in the same latitude,
which must greatly promote its evaporation. The Black Sea being
situated in a higher latitude, and being the receptacle of rivers flowing
from the north, is much colder, and its expenditure far less; accordingly
it does not draw any supply from the Mediterranean, but, on the contrary,
contributes to it by a current flowing outwards, for the most part
of the year, through the Dardanelles. The discharge, however, at the
Bosphorus is so small, when compared to the volume of water carried in
by rivers, as to imply a great amount of evaporation in the Black Sea.</p>

<p><i>Whether salt be precipitated in the Mediterranean.</i>&mdash;It is, however,
objected, that evaporation carries away only fresh water, and that the
current from the Atlantic is continually bringing in salt water: why,
then, do not the component parts of the waters of the Mediterranean
vary? or how can they remain so nearly the same as those of the ocean?
Some have imagined that the excess of salt might be carried away by
an under-current running in a contrary direction to the superior; and
this hypothesis appeared to receive confirmation from a late discovery,
that the water taken up about fifty miles within the Straits, from a depth
of 670 fathoms, contained a quantity of salt <i>four times greater</i> than the
water of the surface. Dr. Wollaston,<a name="FNanchor_457" id="FNanchor_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> who analyzed this water obtained
by Captain Smyth, truly inferred that an under-current of such
denser water flowing outward, if of equal breadth and depth with the
current near the surface, would carry out as much salt below as is brought
in above, although it moved with less than one-fourth part of the velocity,
and would thus prevent a perpetual increase of saltness in the
Mediterranean beyond that existing in the Atlantic. It was also remarked
by others, that the result would be the same, if the swiftness being
equal, the inferior current had only one-fourth of the volume of the
superior. At the same time there appeared reason to conclude that this
great specific gravity was only acquired by water at immense depths;
for two specimens of the water, taken within the Mediterranean, at the
distance of some hundred miles from the Straits, and at depths of 400
and even 450 fathoms, were found by Dr. Wollaston not to exceed in
density that of many ordinary samples of sea-water. Such being the
case, we can now prove that the vast amount of salt brought into the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>
Mediterranean <i>does not</i> pass out again by the Straits; for it appears by
Captain Smyth's soundings, which Dr. Wallaston had not seen, that
between the capes of Trafalgar and Spartel, which are twenty-two miles
apart, and where the Straits are shallowest, the deepest part, which is
on the side of Cape Spartel, is only 220 fathoms. It is therefore evident,
that if water sinks in certain parts of the Mediterranean, in consequence
of the increase of its specific gravity, to greater depths than 220
fathoms, it can never flow out again into the Atlantic, since it must be
stopped by the submarine barrier which crosses the shallowest part of
the Straits of Gibraltar.</p>

<p>The idea of the existence of a counter-current, at a certain depth,
first originated in the following circumstances:&mdash;M. De l'Aigle, commander
of a privateer called the Ph&oelig;nix of Marseilles, gave chase to a
Dutch merchant-ship, near Ceuta Point, and coming up with her in the
middle of the gut, between Tariffa and Tangier, gave her one broadside,
which directly sunk her. A few days after, the sunken ship, with her
cargo of brandy and oil, was cast ashore near Tangier, which is at least
four leagues to the westward of the place where she went down, and
to which she must have floated in a direction contrary to the course of
the <i>central</i> current.<a name="FNanchor_458" id="FNanchor_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> This fact, however, affords no evidence of an
under-current, because the ship, when it approached the coast, would
necessarily be within the influence of a lateral current, which running
westward twice every twenty-four hours, might have brought back the
vessel to Tangier.</p>

<p>What, then, becomes of the excess of salt?&mdash;for this is an inquiry of
the highest geological interest. The Rhone, the Po, the Nile, and
many hundred minor streams and springs, pour annually into the Mediterranean
large quantities of carbonate of lime, together with iron, magnesia,
silica, alumina, sulphur, and other mineral ingredients in a state of
chemical solution. To explain why the influx of this matter does not
alter the composition of this sea has never been regarded as a difficulty;
for it is known that calcareous rocks are forming in the delta of the
Rhone, in the Adriatic, on the coast of Asia Minor, and in other localities.
Precipitation is acknowledged to be the means whereby the surplus
mineral matter is disposed of, after the consumption of a certain
portion in the secretions of testacea, zoophytes, and other marine animals.
But before muriate of soda can, in like manner, be precipitated,
the whole Mediterranean ought, according to the received principles of
chemistry, to become as much saturated with salt as Lake Aral, the
Dead Sea, or the brine-springs of Cheshire.</p>

<p>It is undoubtedly true, in regard to small bodies of water, that every
particle must be fully saturated with muriate of soda before a single
crystal of salt can be formed; such is probably the case in all natural
salterns: such, for example, as those described by travellers as occurring
on the western borders of the Black Sea, where extensive marshes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
are said to be covered by thin films of salt after a rapid evaporation of
sea-water. The salt <i>&eacute;tangs</i> of the Rhone, where salt has sometimes
been precipitated in considerable abundance, have been already mentioned.
In regard to the depth of the Mediterranean, it appears that
between Gibraltar and Ceuta, Captain Smyth sounded to the enormous
depth of 950 fathoms, and found there a gravelly bottom, with fragments
of broken shells. Saussure sounded to the depth of two thousand
feet, within a few yards of the shore, at Nice; and M. B&eacute;rard has
lately fathomed to the depth of more than six thousand feet in several
places without reaching the bottom.<a name="FNanchor_459" id="FNanchor_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a></p>

<p>The central abysses, therefore, of this sea are, in all likelihood, at least
as deep as the Alps are high; and, as at the depth of seven hundred
fathoms only, water has been found to contain a proportion of salt four
times greater than at the surface, we may presume that the excess of
salt may be much greater at the depth of two or three miles. After
evaporation, the surface water becomes impregnated with a slight excess
of salt, and its specific gravity being thus increased, it instantly
falls to the bottom, while lighter water rises to the top, or flows in laterally,
being always supplied by rivers and the current from the Atlantic.
The heavier fluid, when it arrives at the bottom, cannot stop if it
can gain access to any lower part of the bed of the sea, not previously
occupied by water of the same density.</p>

<p>How far this accumulation of brine can extend before the inferior
strata of water will part with any of their salt, and what difference in
such a chemical process the immense pressure of the incumbent ocean,
or the escape of heated vapors, thermal springs, or submarine volcanic
eruptions, might occasion, are questions which cannot be answered in
the present state of science.</p>

<p>The Straits of Gibraltar are said to become gradually wider by the
wearing down of the cliffs on each side at many points; and the current
sets along the coast of Africa, so as to cause considerable inroads
in various parts, particularly near Carthage. Near the Canopic mouth
of the Nile, at Aboukir, the coast was greatly devastated in the year
1784, when a small island was nearly consumed. By a series of similar
operations, the old site of the cities of Nicropolis, Taposiris, Parva
and Canopus, have become a sand-bank.<a name="FNanchor_460" id="FNanchor_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a></p>

<p>From the facts enumerated in the last chapter, it appears that on the
borders of the ocean, currents and tides co-operating with the waves of
the sea are most powerful instruments in the destruction and transportation
of rocks; and as numerous tributaries discharge their alluvial burden
into the channel of one great river, so we find that many rivers
deliver their earthy contents to one marine current, to be borne by it to
a distance, and deposited in some deep receptacle of the ocean. The
current, besides receiving this tribute of sedimentary matter from streams
draining the land, acts also itself on the coast, as does a river on the
cliffs which bound a valley. Yet the waste of cliffs by marine currents
constitutes on the whole a very insignificant portion of the denudation
annually effected by aqueous causes, as I shall point out in the sequel
of this chapter (p. 339).</p>

<p>In inland seas, where the tides are insensible, or on those parts of the
borders of the ocean where they are feeble, it is scarcely possible to
prevent a harbor at a river's mouth from silting up; for a bar of sand
or mud is formed at points where the velocity of the turbid river is
checked by the sea, or where the river and a marine current neutralize
each other's force. For the current, as we have seen, may, like the
river, hold in suspension a large quantity of sediment, or, co-operating
with the waves, may cause the progressive motion of a shingle beach in
one direction. I have already alluded to the erection of piers and groins
at certain places on our southern coast, to arrest the course of the shingle
and sand (see p. <a href="#Page_318">318</a>318). The immediate effect of these temporary obstacles
is to cause a great accumulation of pebbles on one side of the barrier,
after which the beach still moves on round the end of the pier at a
greater distance from the land. This system, however, is often attended
with a serious evil, for during storms the waves throw suddenly into
the harbor the vast heap of pebbles which have collected for years
behind the groin or pier, as happened during a great gale (Jan. 1839)
at Dover.</p>

<p>The formation and keeping open of large estuaries are due to the
<i>combined influence</i> of tidal currents and rivers; for when the tide rises,
a large body of water suddenly enters the mouth of the river, where,
becoming confined within narrower bounds, while its momentum is not
destroyed, it is urged on, and, having to pass through a contracted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
channel, rises and runs with increased velocity, just as a stream when it
reaches the arch of a bridge scarcely large enough to give passage to
its waters, rushes with a steep fall through the arch. During the ascent
of the tide, a body of fresh water, flowing down in an opposite direction
from the higher country, is arrested in its course for several hours;
and thus a large lake of fresh and brackish water is accumulated, which,
when the sea ebbs, is let loose, as on the removal of an artificial sluice
or dam. By the force of this retiring water, the alluvial sediment both
of the river and of the sea is swept away, and transported to such a
distance from the mouth of the estuary, that a small part only can
return with the next tide.</p>

<p>It sometimes happens, that during a violent storm a large bar of sand
is suddenly made to shift its position, so as to prevent the free influx of
the tides, or efflux of river water. Thus about the year 1500 the sands
at Bayonne were suddenly thrown across the mouth of the Adour.
That river, flowing back upon itself, soon forced a passage to the northward
along the sandy plain of Capbreton, till at last it reached the sea
at Boucau, at the distance of <i>seven leagues</i> from the point where it had
formerly entered. It was not till the year 1579 that the celebrated
architect Louis de Foix undertook, at the desire of Henry III., to reopen
the ancient channel, which he at last effected with great
difficulty.<a name="FNanchor_461" id="FNanchor_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a></p>

<p>In the estuary of the Thames at London, and in the Gironde, the
tide rises only for five hours and ebbs seven, and in all estuaries the
water requires a longer time to run down than up; so that the preponderating
force is always in the direction which tends to keep open a
deep and broad passage. But for reasons already explained, there is
naturally a tendency in all estuaries to silt up partially, since eddies,
and backwaters, and points where opposing streams meet, are very
numerous, and constantly change their position.</p>

<p>Many writers have declared that the gain on our eastern coast, since
the earliest periods of history, has more than counterbalanced the loss;
but they have been at no pains to calculate the amount of loss, and have
often forgotten that, while the new acquisitions are manifest, there are
rarely any natural monuments to attest the former existence of the land
that has been carried away. They have also taken into their account
those tracts artificially recovered, which are often of great agricultural
importance, and may remain secure, perhaps, for thousands of years,
but which are only a few feet above the mean level of the sea, and are
therefore exposed to be overflowed again by a small proportion of the
force required to move cliffs of considerable height on our shores. If it
were true that the area of land annually abandoned by the sea in estuaries
were equal to that invaded by it, there would still be no compensation
<i>in kind</i>.</p>

<p>The tidal current which flows out from the northwest, and bears
against the eastern coast of England, transports, as we have seen, materials
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
of various kinds. Aided by the waves, it undermines and sweeps
away the granite, gneiss, trap-rocks, and sandstone of Shetland, and
removes the gravel and loam of the cliffs of Holderness, Norfolk, and
Suffolk, which are between twenty and three hundred feet in height,
and which waste at various rates of from one foot to six yards annually.
It also bears away, in co-operation with the Thames and the tides, the
strata of London clay on the coast of Essex and Sheppey. The sea at
the same time consumes the chalk with its flints for many miles continuously
on the shores of Kent and Sussex&mdash;commits annual ravages
on the freshwater beds, capped by a thick covering of chalk-flint gravel,
in Hampshire, and continually saps the foundations of the Portland limestone.
It receives, besides, during the rainy months, large supplies of
pebbles, sand, and mud, which numerous streams from the Grampians,
Cheviots, and other chains, send down to the sea. To what regions,
then, is all this matter consigned? It is not retained in mechanical
suspension by the waters of the ocean, nor does it mix with them in a
state of chemical solution&mdash;it is deposited <i>somewhere</i>, yet certainly not
in the immediate neighborhood of our shores; for, in that case, there
would soon be a cessation of the encroachment of the sea, and large
tracts of low land, like Romney Marsh, would almost everywhere encircle
our island.</p>

<p>As there is now a depth of water exceeding thirty feet, in some spots
where towns like Dunwich flourished but a few centuries ago, it is clear
that the current not only carries far away the materials of the wasted
cliffs, but is capable also of excavating the bed of the sea to a certain
moderate depth.</p>

<p>So great is the quantity of matter held in suspension by the tidal
current on our shores, that the waters are in some places artificially
introduced into certain lands below the level of the sea; and by repeating
this operation, which is called "warping," for two or three years,
considerable tracts have been raised, in the estuary of the Humber, to
the height of about six feet. If a current, charged with such materials,
meets with deep depressions in the bed of the ocean, it must often fill
them up; just as a river, when it meets with a lake in its course, fills it
gradually with sediment.</p>

<p>I have said (p. <a href="#Page_337">337</a>) that the action of the waves and currents on sea-cliffs,
or their power to remove matter from above to below the sea-level,
is insignificant in comparison with the power of rivers to perform
the same task. As an illustration we may take the coast of Holderness
described in the last chapter (p. 304). It is composed, as we have
seen, of very destructible materials, is thirty-six miles long, and its average
height may be taken at forty feet. As it has wasted away at the
rate of two and a quarter yards annually, for a long period, it will be
found on calculation that the quantity of matter thrown down into the
sea every year, and removed by the current, amounts to 51,321,600
cubic feet. It has been shown that the united Ganges and Brahmapootra
carry down to the Bay of Bengal 40,000,000,000 of cubic feet
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
of solid matter every year, so that their transporting power is no less
than 780 times greater than that of the sea on the coast above-mentioned;
and in order to produce a result equal to that of the two Indian
rivers, we must have a line of wasting coast, like that of Holderness,
nearly 28,000 miles in length, or longer than the entire circumference
of the globe by above 3000 miles. The reason of so great a difference
in the results may be understood when we reflect that the operations
of the ocean are limited to a single line of cliff surrounding a large area,
whereas great rivers with their tributaries, and the mountain torrents which
flow into them, act simultaneously on a length of bank almost indefinite.</p>

<p>Nevertheless we are by no means entitled to infer, that the denuding
force of the great ocean is a geological cause of small efficacy, or inferior
to that of rivers. Its chief influence is exerted at moderate depths
below the surface, on all those areas which are slowly rising, or are
attempting, as it were, to rise above the sea. From data hitherto obtained
respecting subterranean movements, we can scarcely speculate
on an average rate of upheaval of more than two or three feet in a
century. An elevation to this amount is taking place in Scandinavia,
and probably in many submarine areas as vast as those which we know
to be sinking from the proofs derived from circular lagoon islands or
coral atolls. (See chap. 50.) Suppose strata as destructible as those
of the Wealden, or the lower and upper cretaceous formation, or the
tertiary deposits of the British Isles to be thus slowly upheaved, how
readily might they all be swept away by waves and currents in an
open sea! How entirely might each stratum disappear as it was
brought up successively and exposed to the breakers! Shoals of wide
extent might be produced, but it is difficult to conceive how any continent
could ever be formed under such circumstances. Were it not
indeed for the hardness and toughness of the crystalline and volcanic
rocks, which are often capable of resisting the action of the waves, few
lands might ever emerge from the midst of an open sea.</p>

<p><i>Supposed filling up of the German Ocean.</i>&mdash;The German Ocean is
deepest on the Norwegian side, where the soundings give 190 fathoms;
but the mean depth of the whole basin may be stated at no more than
thirty-one fathoms.<a name="FNanchor_462" id="FNanchor_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a> The bed of this sea is traversed by several enormous
banks, the greatest of which is the Dogger Bank, extending for
upwards of 354 miles from north to south. The whole superficies of
these shoals is equal to about one-third of the whole extent of England
and Scotland. The average height of the banks measures, according to
Mr. Stevenson, about seventy-eight feet; the upper portion of them
consisting of fine and coarse siliceous sand, mixed with comminuted
corals and shells.<a name="FNanchor_463" id="FNanchor_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a> It had been supposed that these vast submarine
hills were made up bodily of loose materials supplied from the waste of
the English, Dutch, and other coasts; but the survey of the North Sea,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
conducted by Captain Hewett, affords ground for suspecting this opinion
to be erroneous. If such immense mounds of sand and mud had
been accumulated under the influence of currents, the same causes ought
nearly to have reduced to one level the entire bottom of the German
Ocean; instead of which some long narrow ravines are found to intersect
the banks. One of these varies from seventeen to forty-four
fathoms in depth, and has very precipitous sides; in one part, called
the "Inner Silver Pits," it is fifty-five fathoms deep. The shallowest
parts of the Dogger Bank were found to be forty-two feet under water,
except in one place, where the wreck of a ship had caused a shoal.
Such uniformity in the minimum depth of water seems to imply that
the currents, which vary in their velocity from a mile to two miles and
a half per hour, have power to prevent the accumulation of drift matter
in places of less depth.</p>

<p><i>Strata deposited by currents.</i>&mdash;It appears extraordinary, that in some
tracts of the sea, adjoining the coast of England, where we know that
currents are not only sweeping along rocky masses, thrown down, from
time to time, from the high cliffs, but also occasionally scooping out
channels in the regular strata, there should exist fragile shells and tender
zoophytes in abundance, which live uninjured by these violent movements.
The ocean, however, is in this respect a counterpart of the
land; and as, on the continents, rivers may undermine their banks, uproot
trees, and roll along sand and gravel, while their waters are inhabited
by testacea and fish, and their alluvial plains are adorned with rich
vegetation and forests, so the sea may be traversed by rapid currents,
and its bed may here and there suffer great local derangement, without
any interruption of the general order and tranquillity. It has been ascertained
by soundings in all parts of the world, that where new deposits
are taking place in the sea, coarse sand and small pebbles commonly
occur near the shore, while farther from land, and in deeper water, finer
sand and broken shells are spread out over the bottom. Still farther
out, the finest mud and ooze are alone met with. Mr. Austen observes
that this rule holds good in every part of the English Channel examined
by him. He also informs us, that where the tidal current runs rapidly
in what are called "races," where surface undulations are perceived
in the calmest weather, over deep banks, the discoloration of the water
does not arise from the power of such a current to disturb the bottom
at a depth of 40 or 80 fathoms, as some have supposed. In these cases,
a column of water sometimes 500 feet in height, is moving onwards with
the tide clear and transparent above, while the lower portion holds fine
sediment in suspension (a fact ascertained by soundings), when suddenly
it impinges upon a bank, and its height is reduced to 300 feet.
It is thus made to boil up and flow off at the surface, a process which
forces up the lower strata of water charged with fine particles of mud,
which in their passage from the coast had gradually sunk to a depth of
300 feet or more.<a name="FNanchor_464" id="FNanchor_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
One important character in the formations produced by currents is,
the immense extent over which they may be the means of diffusing
homogeneous mixtures, for these are often coextensive with a great
line of coast; and, by comparison with their deposits, the deltas of
rivers must shrink into significance. In the Mediterranean, the same
current which is rapidly destroying many parts of the African coast,
between the Straits of Gibraltar and the Nile, checks also the growth
of the delta of the Nile, and drifts the sediment of that great river to
the eastward. To this source may be attributed the rapid accretions
of land on parts of the Syrian shores where rivers do not enter.</p>

<p>Among the greatest deposits now in progress, and of which the distribution
is chiefly determined by currents, we may class those between
the mouths of the Amazon and the southern coast of North America.
Captain Sabine found that the equatorial current before mentioned
(p. 292) was running with the rapidity of four miles an hour where it crosses
the stream of the Amazon, which river preserves part of its original
impulse, and has its waters not wholly mingled with those of the ocean
at the distance of 300 miles from its mouth.<a name="FNanchor_465" id="FNanchor_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a> The sediment of the
Amazon is thus constantly carried to the northwest as far as to the
mouths of the Orinoco, and an immense tract of swamp is formed along
the coast of Guiana, with a long range of muddy shoals bordering the
marshes, and becoming converted into land.<a name="FNanchor_466" id="FNanchor_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a> The sediment of the
Orinoco is partly detained, and settles near its mouth, causing the
shores of Trinidad to extend rapidly, and is partly swept away into the
Carribean Sea by the Guinea current. According to Humboldt, much
sediment is carried again out of the Carribean Sea into the Gulf of
Mexico.</p>

<p>It should not be overlooked that marine currents, even on coasts
where there are no large rivers, may still be the agents of spreading not
only sand and pebbles, but the finest mud, far and wide over the bottom
of the ocean. <i>For several thousand miles</i> along the western coast of
South America, comprising the larger parts of Peru and Chili, there is
a perpetual rolling of shingle along the shore, part of which, as Mr.
Darwin has shown, are incessantly reduced to the finest mud by the
waves, and swept into the depths of the Pacific by the tides and currents.
The same author however has remarked that, notwithstanding
the great force of the waves on that shore, all rocks 60 feet under water
are covered by sea-weed, showing that the bed of the sea is not denuded
at that depth, the effects of the winds being comparatively superficial.</p>

<p>In regard to the distribution of sediment by currents it may be observed,
that the rate of subsidence of the finer mud carried down by
every great river into the ocean, or of that caused by the rolling of the
waves upon a shore, must be extremely slow; for the more minute the
separate particles of mud, the slower will they sink to the bottom, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
the sooner will they acquire what is called their terminal velocity. It
is well known that a solid body, descending through a resisting medium,
falls by the force of gravity, which is constant, but its motion is
resisted by the medium more and more as its velocity increases, until
the resistance becomes sufficient to counteract the farther increase of
velocity. For example, a leaden ball, one inch diameter, falling through
air of density as at the earth's surface, will never acquire greater velocity
than 260 feet per second, and, in water, its greatest velocity will be
8 feet 6 inches per second. If the diameter of the ball were 1/100 of an
inch, the terminal velocities in air would be 26 feet, and in water &middot;86 of
a foot per second.</p>

<p>Now, every chemist is familiar with the fact, that minute particles
descend with extreme slowness through water, the extent of their
surface being very great in proportion to their weight, and the resistance
of the fluid depending on the amount of surface. A precipitate of
sulphate of baryta, for example, will sometimes require more than five
or six hours to subside one inch;<a name="FNanchor_467" id="FNanchor_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> while oxalate and phosphate of lime
require nearly an hour to subside about an inch and a half and two
inches respectively,<a name="FNanchor_468" id="FNanchor_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> so exceedingly small are the particles of which
these substances consist.</p>

<p>When we recollect that the depth of the ocean is supposed frequently
to exceed three miles, and that currents run through different parts of
that ocean at the rate of four miles an hour, and when at the same time
we consider that some fine mud carried away from the mouths of rivers
and from sea-beaches, where there is a heavy surf, as well as the impalpable
powder showered down by volcanoes, may subside at the rate
of only an inch per hour, we shall be prepared to find examples of the
transportation of sediment over areas of indefinite extent.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for the emery powder used in polishing glass to
take more than an hour to sink one foot. Suppose mud composed of
coarser particles to fall at the rate of two feet per hour, and these to be
discharged into that part of the Gulf Stream which preserves a mean
velocity of three miles an hour for a distance of two thousand miles; in
twenty-eight days these particles will be carried 2016 miles, and will
have fallen only to a depth of 224 fathoms.</p>

<p>In this example, however, it is assumed that the current retains its
superficial velocity at the depth of 224 fathoms, for which we have as
yet no data, although we have seen that the motion of a current may
continue at the depth of 100 fathoms. (See above, p. 28.) Experiments
should be made to ascertain the rate of currents at considerable
distances from the surface, and the time taken by the finest sediment to
settle in sea-water of a given depth, and then the geologist may determine
the area over which homogeneous mixtures may be simultaneously
distributed in certain seas.</p>

<h6>IGNEOUS CAUSES.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Changes of the inorganic world, <i>continued</i>&mdash;Igneous causes&mdash;Division of the subject&mdash;Distinct
volcanic regions&mdash;Region of the Andes&mdash;System of volcanoes
extending from the Aleutian isles to the Molucca and Sunda
islands&mdash;Polynesian

isles&mdash;Periodical alternation of earthquakes in Syria and Southern Italy&mdash;Western
limits of the European region&mdash;Earthquakes rarer and more feeble as
we recede from the centres of volcanic action. Extinct volcanoes not to be included
in lines of active vents.</p></div>

<p>We have hitherto considered the changes wrought, since the times of
history and tradition, by the continued action of aqueous causes on the
earth's surface; and we have next to examine those resulting from igneous
agency. As the rivers and springs on the land, and the tides
and currents in the sea, have, with some slight modifications, been fixed
and constant to certain localities from the earliest periods of which we
have any records, so the volcano and the earthquake have, with few exceptions,
continued, during the same lapse of time, to disturb the same
regions. But as there are signs, on almost every part of our continent,
of great power having been exerted by running water on the surface of
the land, and by waves, tides, and currents on cliffs bordering the sea,
where, in modern times, no rivers have excavated, and no waves or
tidal currents undermined&mdash;so we find signs of volcanic vents and violent
subterranean movements in places where the action of fire or internal
heat has long been dormant. We can explain why the intensity of
the force of aqueous causes should be developed in succession in different
districts. Currents, for example, tides, and the waves of the sea,
cannot destroy coasts, shape out or silt up estuaries, break through
isthmuses, and annihilate islands, form shoals in one place, and remove
them from another, without the direction and position of their destroying
and transporting power becoming transferred to new localities.
Neither can the relative levels of the earth's crust, above and beneath
the waters, vary from time to time, as they are admitted to have varied
at former periods, and as it will be demonstrated that they still do,
without the continents being, in the course of ages, modified, and even
entirely altered, in their external configuration. Such events must
clearly be accompanied by a complete change in the volume, velocity,
and direction of the streams and land floods to which certain regions
give passage. That we should find, therefore, cliffs where the sea once
committed ravages, and from which it has now retired&mdash;estuaries where
high tides once rose, but which are now dried up&mdash;valleys hollowed
out by water, where no streams now flow, is no more than we should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
expect; these and similar phenomena are the necessary consequences
of physical causes now in operation; and if there be no instability in
the laws of nature, similar fluctuations must recur again and again in
time to come.</p>

<p>But, however natural it may be that the force of running water in
numerous valleys, and of tides and currents in many tracts of the sea,
should now be <i>spent</i>, it is by no means so easy to explain why the violence
of the earthquake and the fire of the volcano should also have
become locally extinct at successive periods. We can look back to the
time when the marine strata, whereon the great mass of Etna rests, had
no existence; and that time is extremely modern in the earth's history.
This alone affords ground for anticipating that the eruptions of Etna will
one day cease.</p>

</div>

<p>are the memorable words which are put into the mouth of Pythagoras
by the Roman poet, and they are followed by speculations as to the
cause of volcanic vents shifting their positions. Whatever doubts the
philosopher expresses as to the nature of these causes, it is assumed, as
incontrovertible, that the points of eruption will hereafter vary, <i>because
they have formerly done so</i>; a principle of reasoning which, as I have
endeavored to show in former chapters, has been too much set at naught
by some of the earlier schools of geology, which refused to conclude
that great revolutions in the earth's surface are now in progress, or that
they will take place hereafter, <i>because</i> they have often been repeated in
former ages.</p>

<p><i>Division of the subject.</i>&mdash;Volcanic action may be defined to be "the
influence exerted by the heated interior of the earth on its external
covering." If we adopt this definition, without connecting it, as Humboldt
has done, with the theory of secular refrigeration, or the cooling
down of an original heated and fluid nucleus, we may then class under
a general head all the subterranean phenomena, whether of volcanoes, or
earthquakes, and those insensible movements of the land, by which, as
will afterwards appear, large districts may be depressed or elevated,
without convulsions. According to this view, I shall consider first, the
volcano; secondly, the earthquake; thirdly, the rising or sinking of land
in countries where there are no volcanoes or earthquakes; fourthly, the
probable <i>causes</i> of the changes which result from subterranean agency.</p>

<p>It is a very general opinion that earthquakes and volcanoes have a
common origin; for both are confined to certain regions, although the
subterranean movements are least violent in the immediate proximity of
volcanic vents, especially where the discharge of aeriform fluids and
melted rock is made constantly from the same crater. But as there are
particular regions, to which both the points of eruption and the movements
of great earthquakes are confined, I shall begin by tracing out the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
geographical boundaries of some of these, that the reader may be aware
of the magnificent scale on which the agency of subterranean fire is now
simultaneously developed. Over the whole of the vast tracts alluded to,
active volcanic vents are distributed at intervals, and most commonly
arranged in a linear direction. Throughout the intermediate spaces there
is often abundant evidence that the subterranean fire is at work continuously,
for the ground is convulsed from time to time by earthquakes;
gaseous vapors, especially carbonic acid gas, are disengaged plentifully
from the soil; springs often issue at a very high temperature, and their
waters are usually impregnated with the same mineral matters as are
discharged by volcanoes during eruptions.</p>

<h6>VOLCANIC REGIONS.</h6>

<p><i>Region of the Andes.</i>&mdash;Of these great regions, that of the Andes of
South America is one of the best defined, extending from the southward
of Chili to the northward of Quito, from about lat. 43&deg; S. to about 2&deg; N.
of the equator. In this range, however, comprehending forty-five degrees
of latitude, there is an alternation on a grand scale of districts of
active with those of extinct volcanoes, or which, if not spent, have at
least been dormant for the last three centuries. How long an interval
of rest may entitle us to consider a volcano as entirely extinct is not
easily determined; but we know that in Ischia there intervened between
two consecutive eruptions a pause of seventeen centuries; and the discovery
of America is an event of far too recent a date to allow us even
to conjecture whether different portions of the Andes, nearly the whole
of which are subject to earthquakes, may not experience alternately a
cessation and renewal of eruptions.</p>

<p>The first line of active vents which have been seen in eruption in the
Andes extends from lat. 43&deg; 28' S.; or, from Yantales, opposite the isle
of Chiloe, to Coquimbo, in lat. 30&deg; S.; to these thirteen degrees of latitude
succeed more than eight degrees in which no recent volcanic eruptions
have been observed. We then come to the volcanoes of Bolivia
and Peru, reaching six degrees from S. to N., or from lat. 21&deg; S. to lat.
15&deg; S. Between the Peruvian volcanoes and those of Quito, another
space intervenes of no less than fourteen degrees of latitude, said to be
free from volcanic action so far as yet known. The volcanoes of Quito
then succeed, beginning about 100 geographical miles south of the equator,
and continuing for about 130 miles north of the line, when there
occurs another undisturbed interval of more than six degrees of latitude,
after which we arrive at the volcanoes of Guatemala or Central America,
north of the Isthmus of Panama.<a name="FNanchor_469" id="FNanchor_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a></p>

<p>Having thus traced out the line from south to north, I may first state,
in regard to the numerous vents of Chili, that the volcanoes of Yantales
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>
and Osorno were in eruption during the great earthquake of 1835, at the
same moment that the land was shaken in Chiloe, and in some parts of
the Chilian coast permanently upheaved; whilst at Juan Fernandez, at
the distance of no less than 720 geographical miles from Yantales, an
eruption took place beneath the sea. Some of the volcanoes of Chili are
of great height, as that of Antuco, in lat. 37&deg; 40' S., the summit of
which is at least 16,000 feet above the sea. From the flanks of this
volcano, at a great height, immense currents of lava have issued, one of
which flowed in the year 1828. This event is said to be an exception
in the general rule; few volcanoes in the Andes, and none of those in
Quito, having been seen in modern times to pour out lava, but having
merely ejected vapor or scori&aelig;.</p>

<p>Both the basaltic (or augitic) lavas, and those of the felspathic class,
occur in Chili and other parts of the Andes; but the volcanic rocks of
the felspathic family are said by Von Buch to be generally not trachyte,
but a rock which has been called andesite, or a mixture of augite and
albite. The last-mentioned mineral contains soda instead of the potash
found in common felspar.</p>

<p>The volcano of Rancagua, lat. 34&deg; 15' S., is said to be always throwing
out ashes and vapors like Stromboli, a proof of the permanently
heated state of certain parts of the interior of the earth below. A year
rarely passes in Chili without some slight shocks of earthquakes, and in
certain districts not a month. Those shocks which come from the side
of the ocean are the most violent, and the same is said to be the case in
Peru. The town of Copiapo was laid waste by this terrible scourge in
the years 1773, 1796, and 1819, or in both cases after regular intervals
of twenty-three years. There have, however, been other shocks in that
country in the periods intervening between the dates above mentioned,
although probably all less severe, at least on the exact site of Copiapo.
The evidence against a regular recurrence of volcanic convulsions at
stated periods is so strong as a general fact, that we must be on our
guard against attaching too much importance to a few striking but
probably accidental coincidences. Among these last might be adduced
the case of Lima, violently shaken by an earthquake on the 17th of June,
1578, and again on the very same day, 1678; or the eruptions of
Coseguina in the year 1709 and 1809, which are the only two recorded
of that volcano previous to that of 1835.<a name="FNanchor_470" id="FNanchor_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a></p>

<p>Of the permanent upheaval of land after earthquakes in Chili, I shall
have occasion to speak in the next chapter, when it will also be seen
that great shocks often coincide with eruptions, either submarine or
from the cones of the Andes, showing the identity of the force which
elevates continents with that which causes volcanic outbursts.<a name="FNanchor_471" id="FNanchor_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a></p>

<p>The space between Chili and Peru, in which no volcanic action has
been observed, is 160 nautical leagues from south to north. It is,
however, as Von Buch observes, that part of the Andes which is least
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">348</a></span>
known, being thinly peopled, and in some parts entirely desert. The
volcanoes of Peru rise from a lofty platform to vast heights above the
level of the sea, from 17,000 to 20,000 feet. The lava which has issued
from Viejo, lat. 16&deg; 55' S., accompanied by pumice, is composed of a
mixture of crystals of albitic felspar, hornblende, and mica, a rock
which has been considered as one of the varieties of andesite. Some
tremendous earthquakes which have visited Peru in modern times will
be mentioned in a subsequent chapter.</p>

<p>The volcanoes of Quito, occurring between the second degree of south
and the third degree of north latitude, rise to vast elevations above the
sea, many of them being between 14,000 and 18,000 feet high. The
Indians of Lican have a tradition that the mountain called L'Altar, or
Capac Urcu, which means "the chief," was once the highest of those
near the equator, being higher than Chimborazo; but in the reign of
Ouainia Abomatha, before the discovery of America, a prodigious eruption
took place, which lasted eight years, and broke it down. The fragments
of trachyte, says M. Boussingault, which once formed the conical
summit of this celebrated mountain, are at this day spread over the
plain.<a name="FNanchor_472" id="FNanchor_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> Cotopaxi is the most lofty of all the South American volcanoes
which have been in a state of activity in modern times, its height being
18,858 feet; and its eruptions have been more frequent and destructive
than those of any other mountain. It is a perfect cone, usually covered
with an enormous bed of snow, which has, however, been sometimes
melted suddenly during an eruption; as in January, 1803, for example,
when the snows were dissolved in one night.</p>

<p>Deluges are often caused in the Andes by the liquefaction of great
masses of snow, and sometimes by the rending open, during earthquakes,
of subterranean cavities filled with water. In these inundations
fine volcanic sand, loose stones, and other materials which the water
meets with in its descent, are swept away, and a vast quantity of mud,
called "moya," is thus formed and carried down into the lower regions.
Mud derived from this source descended, in 1797, from the sides of
Tunguragua in Quito, and filled valleys a thousand feet wide to the
depth of six hundred feet, damming up rivers and causing lakes. In
these currents and lakes of moya, thousands of small fish are sometimes
enveloped, which, according to Humboldt, have lived and multiplied
in subterranean cavities. So great a quantity of these fish were
ejected from the volcano of Imbaburu in 1691, that fevers, which prevailed
at the period, were attributed to the effluvia arising from the
putrid animal matter.</p>

<p>In Quito, many important revolutions in the physical features of the
country are said to have resulted, within the memory of man, from the
earthquakes by which it has been convulsed. M. Boussingault declares
his belief, that if a full register had been kept of all the convulsions experienced
here and in other populous districts of the Andes, it would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
be found that the trembling of the earth had been incessant. The frequency
of the movement, he thinks, is not due to volcanic explosions,
but to the continual falling in of masses of rock which have been fractured
and upheaved in a solid form at a comparatively recent epoch;
but a longer series of observations would be requisite to confirm this
opinion. According to the same author, the height of several mountains
of the Andes has diminished in modern times.<a name="FNanchor_473" id="FNanchor_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a></p>

<p>The great crest or cordillera of the Andes is depressed at the Isthmus
of Panama to a height of about 1000 feet, and at the lowest point of
separation between the two seas near the Gulf of San Miguel, to 150
feet. What some geographers regard as a continuation of that chain
in Central America lies to the east of a series of volcanoes, many of
which are active in the provinces of Pasto, Popayan, and Guatemala.
Coseguina, on the south side of the Gulf of Fonseca, was in eruption in
January, 1835, and some of its ashes fell at Truxillo, on the shores of
the Gulf of Mexico. What is still more remarkable, on the same day,
at Kingston, in Jamaica, the same shower of ashes fell, having been carried
by an upper counter-current against the regular east wind which
was then blowing. Kingston is about 700 miles distant from Coseguina,
and these ashes must have been more than four days in the air, having
travelled 170 miles a day. Eight leagues to the southward of the crater,
the ashes covered the ground to the depth of three yards and a half,
destroying the woods and dwellings. Thousands of cattle perished, their
bodies being in many instances one mass of scorched flesh. Deer and
other wild animals sought the towns for protection; many birds and
quadrupeds were found suffocated in the ashes, and the neighboring
streams were strewed with dead fish.<a name="FNanchor_474" id="FNanchor_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> Such facts throw light on geological
monuments, for in the ashes thrown out at remote periods from
the volcanoes of Auvergne, now extinct, we find the bones and skeletons
of lost species of quadrupeds.</p>

<p><i>Mexico.</i>&mdash;The great volcanic chain, after having thus pursued its
course for several thousand miles from south to north, sends off a
branch in a new direction in Mexico, in the parallel of the city of that
name, and is prolonged in a great platform between the eighteenth and
twenty-second degrees of north latitude. Five active volcanoes traverse
Mexico from west to east&mdash;Tu&#8175;xtla, Orizaba, Popocatepetl, Jorullo, and
Colima. Jorullo, which is in the centre of the great platform, is no less
than 120 miles from the nearest ocean&mdash;an important circumstance, as
showing that the proximity of the sea is not a necessary condition,
although certainly a very general characteristic of the position of active
volcanoes. The extraordinary eruption of this mountain, in 1759, will
be described in the sequel. If the line which connects these five vents
be prolonged in a westerly direction, it cuts the volcanic group of islands
called the Isles of Revillagigedo.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span>
To the north of Mexico there are said to be three, or according to
some, five volcanoes in the peninsula of California; and a volcano is
reported to have been in eruption in the N. W. coast of America, near
the Colombia river, lat. 45&deg; 37' N.</p>

<p><i>West Indies.</i>&mdash;To return to the Andes of Quito: Von Buch inclines
to the belief that if we were better acquainted with the region to the
east of the Madalena, and with New Granada and the Caraccas, we
might find the volcanic chain of the Andes to be connected with that
of the West Indian or Carribee Islands. The truth of this conjecture
has almost been set at rest by the eruption, in 1848, of the volcano of
Zamba, in New Grenada, at the mouth of the river Madalena.<a name="FNanchor_475" id="FNanchor_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a></p>

<p>Of the West Indian islands there are two parallel series: the one to
the west, which are all volcanic, and which rise to the height of several
thousand feet; the others to the east, for the most part composed of
calcareous rocks, and very low. In the former or volcanic series, are
Granada, St. Vincent, St. Lucia, Martinique, Dominica, Guadaloupe,
Montserrat, Nevis, and St. Eustace. In the calcareous chain are Tobago,
Barbadoes, Mariegallante, Grandeterre, Desirade, Antigua, Barbuda,
St. Bartholomew, and St. Martin. The most considerable eruptions in
modern times have been those of St. Vincent. Great earthquakes have
agitated St. Domingo, as will be seen in the twenty-ninth chapter.</p>

<p>I have before mentioned (p. 270) the violent earthquake which in
1812 convulsed the valley of the Mississippi at New Madrid, for the
space of 300 miles in length, of which more will be said in the twenty-seventh
chapter. This happened exactly at the same time as the great
earthquake of Caraccas, so that it is possible that these two points are
parts of one subterranean volcanic region. The island of Jamaica, with
a tract of the contiguous sea, has often experienced tremendous shocks;
and these are frequent along a line extending from Jamaica to St. Domingo
and Porto Rico.</p>

<p>Thus it will be seen that, without taking account of the West Indian
and Mexican branches, a linear train of volcanoes and tracts shaken by
earthquakes may be traced from the island of Chiloe and opposite coast
to Mexico, or even perhaps to the mouth of the Colombia river&mdash;a distance
upon the whole as great as from the pole to the equator. In regard
to the western limits of the region, they lie deep beneath the
waves of the Pacific, and must continue unknown to us. On the east
they are not prolonged, except where they include the West Indian
Islands, to a great distance; for there seem to be no indications of volcanic
disturbances in Buenos Ayres, Brazil, and the United States of
North America.</p>

<p><i>Volcanic region from the Aleutian Isles to the Moluccas and Isles of
Sunda.</i>&mdash;On a scale which equals or surpasses that of the Andes, is
another line of volcanic action, which commences, on the north, with
the Aleutian Isles in Russian America, and extends, first in a westerly
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
direction for nearly 200 geographical miles, and then southwards, with
few interruptions, throughout a space of between sixty and seventy degrees
of latitude to the Moluccas, where it sends off a branch to the
southeast while the principal train continues westerly through Sumbawa
and Java to Sumatra, and then in a northwesterly direction to the
Bay of Bengal.<a name="FNanchor_476" id="FNanchor_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> This volcanic line, observes Von Buch, may be said
to follow throughout its course the external border of the continent of
Asia; while the branch which has been alluded to as striking southeast
from the Moluccas, passes from New Guinea to New Zealand, conforming,
though somewhat rudely, to the outline of Australia.<a name="FNanchor_477" id="FNanchor_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a></p>

<p>The connection, however, of the New Guinea volcanoes with the line
in Java (as laid down in Von Buch's map) is not clearly made out. By
consulting Darwin's map of coral reefs and active volcanoes,<a name="FNanchor_478" id="FNanchor_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> the reader
will see that we might almost with equal propriety include the Mariana
and Bonin volcanoes in a band with New Guinea. Or if we allow so
much latitude in framing zones of volcanic action, we must also suppose
the New Hebrides, Solomon Isles, and New Ireland to constitute one
line (see map, <a href="#f39">fig. 39</a>, p. 351).</p>

<p>The northern extremity of the volcanic region of Asia, as described
by Von Buch, is on the borders of Cook's Inlet, northeast of the Peninsula
of Alaska, where one volcano, in about the sixtieth degree of latitude,
is said to be 14,000 feet high. In Alaska itself are cones of vast
height, which have been seen in eruption, and which are covered for
two-thirds of their height downwards with perpetual snow. The summit
of the loftiest peak is truncated, and is said to have fallen in during
an eruption in 1786. From Alaska the line is continued through the
Aleutian or Fox Islands to Kamtschatka. In the Aleutian Archipelago
eruptions are frequent, and about thirty miles to the north of Unalaska,
near the Isle of Umnack, a new island was formed in 1796. It was
first observed after a storm, at a point in the sea from which a column
of smoke had been seen to rise. Flames then issued from the new islet
which illuminated the country for ten miles round; a frightful earthquake
shook the new-formed cone, and showers of stones were thrown
as far as Umnack. The eruption continued for several months, and
eight years afterwards, in 1804, when it was explored by some hunters,
the soil was so hot in some places that they could not walk on it. According
to Langsdorf and others, this new island, which is now several
thousand feet high, and two or three miles in circumference, has been
continually found to have increased in size when successively visited by
different travellers; but we have no accurate means of determining how
much of its growth, if any, has been due to upheaval, or how far it has
been exclusively formed by the ejection of ashes and streams of lava.
It seems, however, to be well attested that earthquakes of the most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span>
terrific description agitate and alter the bed of the sea and surface of
the land throughout this tract.</p>

<p>The line is continued in the southern extremity of the Peninsula of
Kamtschatka, where there are many active volcanoes, which, in some
eruptions, have scattered ashes to immense distances. The largest and
most active of these is Klutschew, lat. 56&deg; 3' N., which rises at once
from the sea to the prodigious height of 15,000 feet. Within 700 feet
of the summit, Erman saw, in 1829, a current of lava, emitting a vivid
light, flow down the northwest side to the foot of the cone. A flow of
lava from the summit of Mont Blanc to its base in the valley of Chamouni
would afford but an inadequate idea of the declivity down which
this current descended. Large quantities of ice and snow opposed for
a time a barrier to the lava, until at length the fiery torrent overcame,
by its heat and pressure, this obstacle, and poured down the mountain
side with a frightful noise, which was heard for a distance of more than
fifty miles.<a name="FNanchor_479" id="FNanchor_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a></p>

<p>The Kurile chain of islands constitutes the prolongation of the Kamtschatka
range, where a train of volcanic mountains, nine of which are
known to have been in eruption, trends in a southerly direction. The
line is then continued to the southwest in the great island of Jesso, and
again in Nipon, the principal of the Japanese group. It then extends
by Loo Choo and Formosa to the Philippine Islands, and thence by
Sangir and the northeastern extremity of Celebes to the Moluccas (see
map, <a href="#f39">fig. 39</a>). Afterwards it passes westward through Sumbawa to
Java.</p>

<p>There are said to be thirty-eight considerable volcanoes in Java, some
of which are more than 10,000 feet high. They are remarkable for the
quantity of sulphur and sulphureous vapors which they discharge.
They rarely emit lava, but rivers of mud issue from them, like the moya
of the Andes of Quito. The memorable eruption of Galongoon, in
1822, will be described in the twenty-fifth chapter. The crater of
Taschem, at the eastern extremity of Java, contains a lake strongly
impregnated with sulphuric acid, a quarter of a mile long, from which
a river of acid water issues, which supports no living creature, nor can
fish live in the sea near its confluence. There is an extinct crater near
Batur, called Guevo Upas, or the Valley of Poison, about half a mile in
circumference, which is justly an object of terror to the inhabitants of
the country. Every living being which penetrates into this valley falls
down dead, and the soil is covered with the carcasses of tigers, deer,
birds, and even the bones of men; all killed by the abundant emanations
of carbonic acid gas, by which the bottom of the valley is filled.</p>

<p>In another crater in this land of wonders, near the volcano of Talaga
Bodas, we learn from M. Reinwardt, that the sulphureous exhalations
have killed tigers, birds, and innumerable insects; and the soft parts
of these animals, such as as the fibres, muscles, nails, hair, and skin, are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
very well preserved, while the bones are corroded, and entirely destroyed.</p>

<p>We learn from observations made in 1844, by Mr. Jukes, that a
recent tertiary formation composed of limestone and resembling the
coral rock of a fringing reef, clings to the flanks of all the volcanic
islands from the east end of Timor to the west end of Java. These
modern calcareous strata are often white and chalk-like, sometimes 1000
feet and upwards above the sea, regularly stratified in thick horizontal
beds, and they show that there has been a general elevation of these
islands at a comparatively modern period.<a name="FNanchor_480" id="FNanchor_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a></p>

<p>The same linear arrangement which is observed in Java holds good
in the volcanoes of Sumatra, some of which are of great height, as Berapi,
which is more than 12,000 feet above the sea, and is continually smoking.
Hot springs are abundant at its base. The volcanic line then inclines
slightly to the northwest, and points to Barren Island, lat. 12&deg;
15&acute; N., in the Bay of Bengal. This volcano was in eruption in 1792,
and will be described in the twenty-sixth chapter. The volcanic train
then extends, according to Dr. Macclelland, to the island of Narcondam,
lat. 13&deg; 22&acute; N., which is a cone seven or eight hundred feet high,
rising from deep water, and said to present signs of lava currents descending
from the crater to the base. Afterwards the train stretches
in the same direction to the volcanic island of Ramree, about lat. 19&deg; N.,
and the adjoining island of Cheduba, which is represented in old charts
as a burning mountain. Thus we arrive at the Chittagong coast, which
in 1762 was convulsed by a tremendous earthquake (see chap. <a href="#Page_498">29</a>).<a name="FNanchor_481" id="FNanchor_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a></p>

<p>To enumerate all the volcanic regions of the Indian and Pacific oceans
would lead me far beyond the proper limits of this treatise; but it will
appear in the last chapter of this volume, when coral reefs are treated
of, that the islands of the Pacific consist alternately of linear groups of
two classes, the one lofty, and containing active volcanoes, and marine
strata above the sea-level, and which have been undergoing upheaval in
modern times; the other very low, consisting of reefs of coral, usually
with lagoons in their centres, and in which there is evidence of a gradual
subsidence of the ground. The extent and direction of these parallel
volcanic bands have been depicted with great care by Darwin in his
map before cited (p. <a href="#Page_351">351</a>).</p>

<p>The most remarkable theatre of volcanic activity in the Northern
Pacific&mdash;or, perhaps, in the whole world&mdash;occurs in the Sandwich
Islands, which have been admirably treated of in a recent work by Mr.
Dana.<a name="FNanchor_482" id="FNanchor_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a></p>

<p><i>Volcanic region from central Asia to the Azores.</i>&mdash;Another great
region of subterranean disturbance is that which has been imagined to
extend through a large part of Central Asia to the Azores, that is to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
say, from China and Tartary through Lake Aral and the Caspian to the
Caucasus, and the countries bordering the Black Sea, then again through
part of Asia Minor to Syria, and westward to the Grecian Islands,
Greece, Naples, Sicily, the southern part of Spain, Portugal and the
Azores. Respecting the eastern extremity of this line in China, we
have little information, but many violent earthquakes are known to
have occurred there. The volcano said to have been in eruption in the
seventh century in Central Tartary is situated on the northern declivity
of the Celestial Mountains, not far distant from the large lake called
Issikoul; and Humboldt mentions other vents and solfataras in the
same quarter, which are all worthy of notice, as being far more distant
from the ocean (260 geographical miles) than any other known points
of eruption.</p>

<p>We find on the western shores of the Caspian, in the country round
Baku, a tract called the Field of Fire, which continually emits inflammable
gas, while springs of naphtha and petroleum occur in the same
vicinity, as also mud volcanoes. Syria and Palestine abound in volcanic
appearances, and very extensive areas have been shaken, at different
periods, with great destruction of cities and loss of lives. Continual
mention is made in history of the ravages committed by earthquakes in
Sidon, Tyre, Berytus, Laodicea, and Antioch, and in the Island of
Cyprus. The country around the Dead Sea appears evidently, from
the accounts of modern travellers, to be volcanic. A district near
Smyrna, in Asia Minor, was termed by the Greeks Catacecaumene, or
"the burnt up," where there is a large arid territory, without trees,
and with a cindery soil.<a name="FNanchor_483" id="FNanchor_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> This country was visited in 1841 by Mr. W.
J. Hamilton, who found in the valley of the Hermus perfect cones of
scori&aelig;, with lava-streams, like those of Auvergne, conforming to the
existing river-channels, and with their surface undecomposed.<a name="FNanchor_484" id="FNanchor_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a></p>

<p><i>Grecian Archipelago.</i>&mdash;Proceeding westwards, we reach the Grecian
Archipelago, where Santorin, afterwards to be described, is the grand
centre of volcanic action.</p>

<p>It was Von Buch's opinion that the volcanoes of Greece were arranged
in a line running N. N. W. and S. S. E., and that they afforded the
only example in Europe of active volcanoes having a linear direction;
but M. Virlet, on the contrary, announces as the result of his investigations,
made during the French expedition to the Morea in 1829, that
there is no one determinate line of direction for the volcanic phenomena
in Greece, whether we follow the points of eruptions, or the earthquakes,
or any other signs of igneous agency.<a name="FNanchor_485" id="FNanchor_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a></p>

<p>Macedonia, Thrace, and Epirus, have always been subject to earthquakes,
and the Ionian Isles are continually convulsed.</p>

<p>Respecting Southern Italy, Sicily, and the Lipari Isles, it is unnecessary
to enlarge here, as I shall have occasion again to allude to them.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
I may mention, however, that a band of volcanic action has been traced
by Dr. Daubeny across the Italian Peninsula, from Ischia to Mount
Vultur, in Apulia, the commencement of the line being found in the
hot springs of Ischia, after which it is prolonged through Vesuvius to
the Lago d'Ansanto, where gases similar to those of Vesuvius are
evolved. Its farther extension strikes Mount Vultur, a lofty cone composed
of tuff and lava, from one side of which carbonic acid and sulphuretted
hydrogen are emitted.<a name="FNanchor_486" id="FNanchor_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a></p>

<p><i>Traditions of deluges.</i>&mdash;The traditions which have come down to us
from remote ages of great inundations said to have happened in Greece
and on the confines of the Grecian settlements, had doubtless their origin
in a series of local catastrophes, caused principally by earthquakes.
The frequent migrations of the earlier inhabitants, and the total want of
written annals long after the first settlement of each country, make it
impossible for us at this distance of time to fix either the true localities
or probable dates of these events. The first philosophical writers of
Greece were, therefore, as much at a loss as ourselves to offer a reasonable
conjecture on these points, or to decide how many catastrophes
might sometimes have become confounded in one tale, or how much this
tale may have been amplified, in after times, or obscured by mythological
fiction. The floods of Ogyges and Deucalion are commonly said
to have happened before the Trojan war; that of Ogyges more than
seventeen, and that of Deucalion more than fifteen centuries before our
era. As to the Ogygian flood, it is generally described as having laid
waste Attica, and was referred by some writers to a great overflowing
of rivers, to which cause Aristotle also attributed the deluge of Deucalion,
which, he says, affected Hellas only, or the central part of Thessaly.
Others imagined the same event to have been due to an earthquake,
which drew down masses of rock, and stopped up the course of the
Peneus in the narrow defile between mounts Ossa and Olympus.</p>

<p>As to the deluge of Samothrace, which is generally referred to a distinct
date, it appears that the shores of that small island and the adjoining
mainland of Asia were inundated by the sea. Diodorus Siculus
says that the inhabitants had time to take refuge in the mountains, and
save themselves by flight; he also relates, that long after the event the
fishermen of the island drew up in their nets the capitals of columns,
which were the remains of cities submerged by that terrible catastrophe.<a name="FNanchor_487" id="FNanchor_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a>
These statements scarcely leave any doubt that there occurred,
at the period alluded to, a subsidence of the coast, accompanied by
earthquakes and inroads of the sea. It is not impossible that the story
of the bursting of the Black Sea through the Thracian Bosphorus into
the Grecian Archipelago, which accompanied, and, as some say, caused
the Samothracian deluge, may have reference to a wave, or succession
of waves, raised in the Euxine by the same convulsion.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span>
We know that subterranean movements and volcanic eruptions are
often attended not only by incursions of the sea, but also by violent
rains, and the complete derangement of the river drainage of the inland
country, and by the damming up of the outlets of lakes by landslips, or
obstructions in the courses of subterranean rivers, such as abound in
Thessaly and the Morea. We need not therefore be surprised at the
variety of causes assigned for the traditional floods of Greece, by Herodotus,
Aristotle, Diodorus, Strabo, and others. As to the area embraced,
had all the Grecian deluges occurred simultaneously, instead of
being spread over many centuries, and had they, instead of being extremely
local, reached at once from the Euxine to the southwestern
limit of the Peloponnese, and from Macedonia to Rhodes, the devastation
would still have been more limited than that which visited Chili in
1835, when a volcanic eruption broke out in the Andes, opposite Chiloe,
and another at Juan Fernandez, distant 720 geographical miles, at the
same time that several lofty cones, in the Cordillera, 400 miles to the
eastward of that island, threw out vapor and ignited matter. Throughout
a great part of the space thus recently shaken in South America,
cities were laid in ruins, or the land was permanently upheaved, or
mountainous waves rolled inland from the Pacific.</p>

<p><i>Periodical alternation of Earthquakes in Syria and Southern Italy.</i>&mdash;It
has been remarked by Von Hoff, that from the commencement of the
thirteenth to the latter half of the seventeenth century, there was an
almost entire cessation of earthquakes in Syria and Judea; and, during
this interval of quiescence, the Archipelago, together with part of the
adjacent coast of Lesser Asia, as also Southern Italy and Sicily, suffered
greatly from earthquakes; while volcanic eruptions were unusually frequent
in the same regions. A more extended comparison, also, of the
history of the subterranean convulsions of these tracts seems to confirm
the opinion, that a violent crisis of commotion never visits both at the
same time. It is impossible for us to declare, as yet, whether this phenomenon
is constant in this and other regions, because we can rarely
trace back a connected series of events farther than a few centuries; but
it is well known that, where numerous vents are clustered together
within a small area, as in many archipelagoes for instance, two of them
are never in violent eruption at once. If the action of one becomes very
great for a century or more, the others assume the appearance of spent
volcanoes. It is, therefore, not improbable that separate provinces of
the same great range of volcanic fires may hold a relation to one deep-seated
focus, analogous to that which the apertures of a small group
bear to some more superficial rent or cavity. Thus, for example, we
may conjecture that, at a comparatively small distance from the surface,
Ischia and Vesuvius mutually communicate with certain fissures, and
that each affords relief alternately to elastic fluids and lava there generated.
So we may suppose Southern Italy and Syria to be connected,
at a much greater depth, with a lower part of the very same system of
fissures; in which case any obstruction occurring in one duct may have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
the effect of causing almost all the vapor and melted matter to be forced
up the other, and if they cannot get vent, they may be the cause of
violent earthquakes. Some objections advanced against this doctrine
that "volcanoes act as safety-valves," will be considered in the sequel.<a name="FNanchor_488" id="FNanchor_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p>The northeastern portion of Africa, including Egypt, which lies six
or seven degrees south of the volcanic line already traced, has been almost
always exempt from earthquakes; but the northwestern portion,
especially Fez and Morocco, which fall within the line, suffer greatly
from time to time. The southern part of Spain also, and Portugal,
have generally been exposed to the same scourge simultaneously with
Northern Africa. The provinces of Malaga, Murcia, and Granada, and
in Portugal the country round Lisbon, are recorded at several periods
to have been devastated by great earthquakes. It will be seen, from
Michell's account of the great Lisbon shock, in 1755, that the first
movement proceeded from the bed of the ocean ten or fifteen leagues
from the coast. So late as February 2, 1816, when Lisbon was vehemently
shaken, two ships felt a shock in the ocean west from Lisbon;
one of them at the distance of 120, and the other 262 French leagues
from the coast<a name="FNanchor_489" id="FNanchor_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a>&mdash;a fact which is more interesting, because a line drawn
through the Grecian Archipelago, the volcanic region of Southern Italy,
Sicily, Southern Spain, and Portugal, will, if prolonged westward
through the ocean, strike the volcanic group of the Azores, which may
possibly therefore have a submarine connection with the European line.</p>

<p>In regard to the volcanic system of Southern Europe, it may be observed,
that there is a central tract where the greatest earthquakes
prevail, in which rocks are shattered, mountains rent, the surface elevated
or depressed, and cities laid in ruins. On each side of this line of
greatest commotion there are parallel bands of country where the
shocks are less violent. At a still greater distance (as in Northern
Italy, for example, extending to the foot of the Alps), there are spaces
where the shocks are much rarer and more feeble, yet possibly of sufficient
force to cause, by continued repetition, some appreciable alteration
in the external form of the earth's crust. Beyond these limits, again,
all countries are liable to slight tremors, at distant intervals of time,
when some great crisis of subterranean movement agitates an adjoining
volcanic region; but these may be considered as mere vibrations, propagated
mechanically through the external covering of the globe, as sounds
travel almost to indefinite distances through the air. Shocks of this
kind have been felt in England, Scotland, Northern France, and Germany&mdash;particularly
during the Lisbon earthquake. But these countries
cannot, on this account, be supposed to constitute parts of the southern
volcanic region, any more than the Shetland and Orkney islands can be
considered as belonging to the Icelandic circle, because the sands ejected
from Hecla have been wafted thither by the winds.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
Besides the continuous spaces of subterranean disturbance, of which
we have merely sketched the outline, there are other disconnected volcanic
groups, of which several will be mentioned hereafter.</p>

<p><i>Lines of active and extinct Volcanoes not to be confounded.</i>&mdash;We must
always be careful to distinguish between lines of extinct and active volcanoes,
even where they appear to run in the same direction; for ancient
and modern systems may interfere with each other. Already, indeed,
we have proof that this is the case; so that it is not by geographical
position, but by reference to the species of organic beings alone, whether
aquatic or terrestrial, whose remains occur in beds interstratified with
lavas, that we can clearly distinguish the relative age of volcanoes of
which no eruptions are recorded. Had Southern Italy been known to
civilized nations for as short a period as America, we should have had
no record of eruptions in Ischia; yet we might have assured ourselves
that the lavas of that isle had flowed since the Mediterranean was inhabited
by the species of testacea now living in the Neapolitan seas.
With this assurance, it would not have been rash to include the numerous
vents of that island in the modern volcanic group of Campania.</p>

<p>On similar grounds we may infer, without much hesitation, that the
eruptions of Etna, and the modern earthquakes of Calabria, are a continuation
of that action which, at a somewhat earlier period, produced
the submarine lavas of the Val di Noto in Sicily. But on the other
hand, the lavas of the Euganean hills and the Vicentin, although not
wholly beyond the range of earthquakes in Northern Italy, must not
be confounded with any existing volcanic system; for when they flowed,
the seas were inhabited by animals almost all of them distinct from
those now known to live, whether in the Mediterranean or other parts of
the globe.</p>

and modern times.</p></div>

<p>I shall next give a sketch of the history of some of the volcanic vents
dispersed throughout the great regions before described, and consider
the composition and arrangement of their lavas and ejected matter.
The only volcanic region known to the ancients was that of the Mediterranean;
and even of this they have transmitted to us very imperfect
records relating to the eruptions of the three principal districts, namely,
that round Naples, that of Sicily and its isles, and that of the Grecian
Archipelago. By far the most connected series of records throughout a
long period relates to the first of these provinces; and these cannot be
too attentively considered, as much historical information is indispensable
in order to enable us to obtain a clear view of the connection and
alternate mode of action of the different vents in a single volcanic group.</p>

<p><i>Early convulsions in the Island of Ischia.</i>&mdash;-The Neapolitan volcanoes
extend from Vesuvius, through the Phlegr&aelig;an Fields, to Procida and
Ischia, in a somewhat linear arrangement, ranging from the northeast
to the southwest, as will be seen in the annexed map of the volcanic
district of Naples (<a href="#f40">fig. 40</a>). Within the space above limited, the volcanic
force is sometimes developed in single eruptions from a considerable
number of irregularly scattered points; but a great part of its
action has been confined to one principal and habitual vent, Vesuvius or
Somma. Before the Christian era, from the remotest periods of which
we have any tradition, this principal vent was in a state of inactivity.
But terrific convulsions then took place from time to time in Ischia
(Pithecusa), and seem to have extended to the neighboring isle of Procida
(Prochyta); for Strabo<a name="FNanchor_490" id="FNanchor_490"></a><a href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> mentions a story of Procida having been
torn asunder from Ischia; and Pliny<a name="FNanchor_491" id="FNanchor_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> derives its name from its having
been poured forth by an eruption from Ischia.</p>

<p>The present circumference of Ischia along the water's edge is eighteen
miles, its length from west to east about five, and its breadth from north
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
to south three miles. Several Greek colonies which settled there before
the Christian era were compelled to abandon it in consequence of the
violence of the eruptions. First the Erythr&aelig;ans, and afterwards the
Chalcidians, are mentioned as having been driven out by earthquakes
and igneous exhalations. A colony was afterwards established by Hiero,
king of Syracuse, about 380 years before the Christian era; but when
they had built a fortress, they were compelled by an eruption to fly,
and never again returned. Strabo tells us that Tim&aelig;us recorded a tradition,
that, a little before his time, Epomeus, the principal mountain in
the centre of the island, vomited fire during great earthquakes; that
the land between it and the coast had ejected much fiery matter, which
flowed into the sea, and that the sea receded for the distance of three
stadia, and then returning, overflowed the island. This eruption is
supposed by some to have been that which formed the crater of Monte
Corvo on one of the higher flanks of Epomeo, above Foria, the lava-current
of which may still be traced, by aid of the scori&aelig; on its surface,
from the crater to the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 40.</span><a name="f40" id="f40"></a><img src="images/f40.png" width="600" height="454" alt="Map of the volcanic district of Naples." title="" />

<p class="center2">A. Astroni.&nbsp;B. Monte Barbaro.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M. Monte Nuovo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S. The Solfatara.</p>

<p>To one of the subsequent eruptions in the lower parts of the isle,
which caused the expulsion of the first Greek colony, Monte Rotaro
has been attributed, and it bears every mark of recent origin. The
cone, which I examined in 1828, is remarkably perfect, and has a crater
on its summit precisely resembling that of Monte Nuovo near Naples;
but the hill is larger, and resembles some of the more considerable
cones of single eruption near Clermont in Auvergne, and, like some of
them, it has given vent to a lava-stream at its base, instead of its summit.
A small ravine swept out by a torrent exposes the structure of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
the cone, which is composed of innumerable inclined and slightly undulating
layers of pumice, scori&aelig;, white lapilli, and enormous angular
blocks of trachyte. These last have evidently been thrown out by violent
explosions, like those which in 1822 launched from Vesuvius a
mass of augitic lava, of many tons' weight, to the distance of three
miles, which fell in the garden of Prince Ottajano. The cone of Rotaro
is covered with the arbutus, and other beautiful evergreens. Such
is the strength of the virgin soil, that the shrubs have become almost
arborescent; and the growth of some of the smaller wild plants has
been so vigorous, that botanists have scarcely been able to recognize
the species.</p>

<p>The eruption which dislodged the Syracusan colony is supposed to
have given rise to that mighty current which forms the promontory of
Zaro and Caruso. The surface of these lavas is still very arid and
bristling, and is covered with black scori&aelig;; so that it is not without
great labor that human industry has redeemed some small spots, and
converted them into vineyards. Upon the produce of these vineyards
the population of the island is almost entirely supported. It amounted
when I was there, in 1828, to about twenty-five thousand, and was on
the increase.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 41.</span><a name="f41" id="f41"></a><img src="images/f41.png" width="550" height="208"

<i>c.</i> Another of the minor cones with a crater.<a name="FNanchor_492" id="FNanchor_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a></p>

<p>From the date of the great eruption last alluded to, down to our own
time, Ischia has enjoyed tranquillity, with the exception of one emission
of lava hereafter to be described, which, although it occasioned much
local damage, does not appear to have devastated the whole country,
in the manner of more ancient explosions. There are, upon the whole,
on different parts of Epomeo, or scattered through the lower tracts of
Ischia, twelve considerable volcanic cones which have been thrown up
since the island was raised above the surface of the deep; and many
streams of lava may have flowed, like that of "Arso" in 1302, without
cones having been produced; so that this island may, for ages before
the period of the remotest traditions, have served as a safety-valve to
the whole Terra di Lavoro, while the fires of Vesuvius were dormant.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span>
<i>Lake Avernus.</i>&mdash;It seems also clear that Avernus, a circular lake
near Puzzuoli, about half a mile in diameter, which is now a salubrious
and cheerful spot, once exhaled mephitic vapors, such as are often emitted
by craters after eruptions. There is no reason for discrediting the
account of Lucretius, that birds could not fly over it without being
stifled, although they may now frequent it uninjured.<a name="FNanchor_493" id="FNanchor_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> There must
have been a time when this crater was in action; and for many centuries
afterwards it may have deserved the appellation of "atri jauna
Ditis," emitting, perhaps, gases as destructive of animal life as those
suffocating vapors given out by Lake Quilotoa, in Quito, in 1797, by
which whole herds of cattle on its shores were killed,<a name="FNanchor_494" id="FNanchor_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a> or as those deleterious
emanations which annihilated all the cattle in the island of Lancerote,
one of the Canaries, in 1730.<a name="FNanchor_495" id="FNanchor_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> Bory St. Vincent mentions, that
in the same isle birds fell lifeless to the ground; and Sir William Hamilton
informs us that he picked up dead birds on Vesuvius during an
eruption.</p>

<p><i>Solfatara.</i>&mdash;The Solfatara, near Puzzuoli, which may be considered
as a nearly extinguished crater, appears, by the accounts of Strabo and
others, to have been before the Christian era in very much the same
state as at present, giving vent continually to aqueous vapor, together
with sulphureous and muriatic acid gases, like those evolved by Vesuvius.</p>

<p><i>Ancient history of Vesuvius.</i>&mdash;Such, then, were the points where the
subterranean fires obtained vent, from the earliest period to which tradition
reaches back, down to the first century of the Christian era; but
we then arrive at a crisis in the volcanic action of this district&mdash;one of
the most interesting events witnessed by man during the brief period
throughout which he has observed the physical changes on the earth's
surface. From the first colonization of Southern Italy by the Greeks,
Vesuvius afforded no other indications of its volcanic character than
such as the naturalist might infer, from the analogy of its structure to
other volcanoes. These were recognized by Strabo, but Pliny did not
include the mountain in his list of active vents. The ancient cone was
of a very regular form, terminating not as at present in two peaks, but
with a summit which presented, when seen from a distance, the even
outline of an abruptly truncated cone. On the summit, as we learn
from Plutarch, there was a crater with steep cliffs, and having its
interior overgrown with wild vines, and with a sterile plain at the bottom.
On the exterior, the flanks of the mountain were clothed with
fertile fields richly cultivated, and at its base were the populous cities
of Herculaneum and Pompeii. But the scene of repose was at length
doomed to cease, and the volcanic fire was recalled to the main channel,
which at some former unknown period had given passage to repeated
streams of melted lava, sand, and scori&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
<i>Renewal of its eruptions.</i>&mdash;The first symptom of the revival of the
energies of this volcano was the occurrence of an earthquake in the year
63 after Christ, which did considerable injury to the cities in its vicinity.
From that time to the year 79 slight shocks were frequent; and in the
month of August of that year they became more numerous and violent,
till they ended at length in an eruption. The elder Pliny, who commanded
the Roman fleet, was then stationed at Misenum; and in his
anxiety to obtain a near view of the phenomena, he lost his life, being
suffocated by sulphureous vapors. His nephew, the younger Pliny,
remained at Misenum, and has given us, in his Letters, a lively description
of the awful scene. A dense column of vapor was first seen rising
vertically from Vesuvius, and then spreading itself out laterally, so that
its upper portion resembled the head, and its lower the trunk of the
pine, which characterizes the Italian landscape. This black cloud was
pierced occasionally by flashes of fire, as vivid as lightning, succeeded
by darkness more profound than night. Ashes fell even upon the ships
at Misenum, and caused a shoal in one part of the sea&mdash;the ground
rocked, and the sea receded from the shores, so that many marine animals
were seen on the dry sand. The appearances above described
agree perfectly with those witnessed in more recent eruptions, especially
those of Monte Nuovo, in 1538, and of Vesuvius in 1822.</p>

<p>The younger Pliny, although giving a circumstantial detail of so many
physical facts, and describing the eruption and earthquake, and the shower
of ashes which fell at Stabi&aelig;, makes no allusion to the sudden overwhelming
of two large and populous cities, Herculaneum and Pompeii. In explanation
of this omission, it has been suggested that his chief object was
simply to give Tacitus a full account of the particulars of his uncle's death.
It is worthy, however, of remark, that had the buried cities never been
discovered, the accounts transmitted to us of their tragical end might
well have been discredited by the majority, so vague and general are
the narratives, or so long subsequent to the event. Tacitus, the friend
and contemporary of Pliny, when adverting in general terms to the convulsions,
says merely that "cities were consumed or buried."<a name="FNanchor_496" id="FNanchor_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a></p>

<p>Suetonius, although he alludes to the eruption incidentally, is silent
as to the cities. They are mentioned by Martial, in an epigram, as immersed
in cinders; but the first historian who alludes to them by name
is Dion Cassius,<a name="FNanchor_497" id="FNanchor_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> who flourished about a century and a half after Pliny.
He appears to have derived his information from the traditions of the
inhabitants, and to have recorded, without discrimination, all the facts
and fables which he could collect. He tells us, "that during the eruption
a multitude of men of superhuman stature, resembling giants, appeared,
sometimes on the mountain, and sometimes in the environs&mdash;that
stones and smoke were thrown out, the sun was hidden, and then
the giants seemed to rise again, while the sounds of trumpets were
heard, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and finally," he relates, "two entire cities, Herculaneum
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
and Pompeii, were buried under showers of ashes, while all the people
were sitting in the theatre." That many of these circumstances were
invented, would have been obvious, even without the aid of Pliny's letters;
and the examination of Herculaneum and Pompeii enables us to
prove, that none of the people were destroyed in the theatres, and indeed
that there were very few of the inhabitants who did not escape
from both cities. Yet some lives were lost, and there was ample foundation
for the tale in its most essential particulars.</p>

<p>It does not appear that in the year 79 any lava flowed from Vesuvius;
the ejected substances, perhaps, consisted entirely of lapilli, sand,
and fragments of older lava, as when Monte Nuovo was thrown up in
1538. The first era at which we have authentic accounts of the flowing
of a stream of lava, is the year 1036, which is the seventh eruption from
the revival of the fires of the volcano. A few years afterwards, in 1049,
another eruption is mentioned, and another in 1138 (or 1139), after
which a great pause ensued of 168 years. During this long interval of
repose, two minor vents opened at distant points. First, it is on tradition
that an eruption took place from the Solfatara, in the year 1198,
during the reign of Frederick II., Emperor of Germany; and although
no circumstantial detail of the event has reached us from those dark
ages, we may receive the fact without hesitation.<a name="FNanchor_498" id="FNanchor_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> Nothing more, however,
can be attributed to this eruption, as Mr. Scrope observes, than
the discharge of a light and scoriform trachytic lava, of recent aspect,
resting upon the strata of loose tuff which covers the principal mass of
trachyte.<a name="FNanchor_499" id="FNanchor_499"></a><a href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a></p>

<p><i>Volcanic eruption in Ischia</i>, 1302.&mdash;The other occurrence is well
authenticated&mdash;the eruption, in the year 1302, of a lava-stream from a
new vent on the southeast end of the Island of Ischia. During part of
1301, earthquakes had succeeded one another with fearful rapidity; and
they terminated at last with the discharge of a lava-stream from a point
named the Campo del Arso, not far from the town of Ischia. This lava
ran quite down to the sea&mdash;a distance of about two miles; in color it
varies from iron-gray to reddish black, and is remarkable for the glassy
felspar which it contains. Its surface is almost as sterile, after a period
of five centuries, as if it had cooled down yesterday. A few scantlings
of wild thyme, and two or three other dwarfish plants, alone appear in
the interstices of the scori&aelig;, while the Vesuvian lava of 1767 is already
covered with a luxuriant vegetation. Pontanus, whose country-house
was burnt and overwhelmed, describes the dreadful scene as having
lasted two months.<a name="FNanchor_500" id="FNanchor_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> Many houses were swallowed up, and a partial
emigration of the inhabitants followed. This eruption produced no
cone, but only a slight depression, hardly deserving the name of a crater,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
where heaps of black and red scori&aelig; lie scattered around. Until
this eruption, Ischia is generally believed to have enjoyed an interval of
rest for about seventeen centuries; but Julius Obsequens,<a name="FNanchor_501" id="FNanchor_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a> who flourished
<span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 214, refers to some volcanic convulsions in the year 662
after the building of Rome (91 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>) As Pliny, who lived a century
before Obsequens, does not enumerate this among other volcanic eruptions,
the statement of the latter author is supposed to have been erroneous;
but it would be more consistent, for reasons before stated, to
disregard the silence of Pliny, and to conclude, that some kind of subterranean
commotion, probably of no great violence, happened at the
period alluded to.</p>

<p><i>History of Vesuvius after</i> 1138.&mdash;To return to Vesuvius:&mdash;the next
eruption occurred in 1306; between which era and 1631 there was
only one other (in 1500), and that a slight one. It has been remarked,
that throughout this period Etna was in a state of such unusual activity,
as to lend countenance to the idea that the great Sicilian volcano may
sometimes serve as a channel of discharge to elastic fluids and lava that
would otherwise rise to the vents in Campania.</p>

<p><i>Formation of Monte Nuovo</i>, 1538.&mdash;The great pause was also marked
by a memorable event in the Phlegr&aelig;an Fields&mdash;the sudden formation
of a new mountain in 1538, of which we have received authentic accounts
from contemporary writers.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 42.</span><a name="f42" id="f42"></a><img src="images/f42.jpg" width="550" height="390"

</p>

<p>The height of this mountain, called ever since Monte Nuovo, has been
determined by the Italian mineralogist Pini, to be 440 English feet
above the level of the bay; its base is about eight thousand feet, or
more than a mile and a half in circumference. According to Pini, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span>
depth of the crater is 421 English feet from the summit of the hill, so
that its bottom is only nineteen feet above the level of the sea. The
cone is declared, by the best authorities, to stand partly on the site of
the Lucrine Lake (4, <a href="#f43">fig. 43</a>),<a name="FNanchor_502" id="FNanchor_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> which was nothing more than the crater
of a pre-existent volcano, and was almost entirely filled during the explosion
of 1538. Nothing now remains but a shallow pool, separated
from the sea by an elevated beach, raised artificially.</p>

<p>Sir William Hamilton has given us two original letters describing this
eruption. The first, by Falconi, dated 1538, contains the following
passages.<a name="FNanchor_503" id="FNanchor_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> "It is now two years since there have been frequent earthquakes
at Puzzuoli, Naples, and the neighboring parts. On the day
and in the night before the eruption (of Monte Nuovo), above twenty
shocks, great and small, were felt. The eruption began on the 29th of
September, 1538. It was on a Sunday, about one o'clock in the night,
when flames of fire were seen between the hot baths and Tripergola.
In a short time the fire increased to such a degree, that it burst open
the earth in this place, and threw up so great a quantity of ashes and
pumice-stones, mixed with water, as covered the whole country. The
next morning (after the formation of Monte Nuovo) the poor inhabitants
of Puzzuoli quitted their habitations in terror, covered with the muddy
and black shower which continued the whole day in that country&mdash;flying
from death, but with death painted in their countenances. Some
with their children in their arms, some with sacks full of their goods;
others leading an ass, loaded with their frightened family, towards Naples;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span>
others carrying quantities of birds, of various sorts, that had fallen
dead at the beginning of the eruption; others, again, with fish which
they had found, and which were to be met with in plenty on the shore,
the sea having left them dry for a considerable time. I accompanied
Signor Moramaldo to behold the wonderful effects of the eruption. The
sea had retired on the side of Bai&aelig;, abandoning a considerable tract,
and the shore appeared almost entirely dry, from the quantity of ashes
and broken pumice-stones thrown up by the eruption. I saw two
springs in the newly discovered ruins; one before the house that was
the queen's, of hot and salt water," &amp;c.</p>

<p>So far Falconi: the other account is by Pietro Giacomo di Toledo,
which begins thus:&mdash;"It is now two years since this province of Campagna
has been afflicted with earthquakes, the country about Puzzuoli
much more so than any other parts; but the 27th and the 28th of the
month of September last, the earthquakes did not cease day or night
in the town of Puzzuoli: that plain which lies between Lake Avernus,
the Monte Barbaro, and the sea, was <i>raised a little</i>, and many cracks
were made in it, from some of which issued water; at the same time the
sea, immediately joining the plain, <i>dried up about two hundred paces</i>, so
that the fish were left on the sand a prey to the inhabitants of Puzzuoli.
At last, on the 29th of the same month, about two o'clock in the night,
the earth opened near the lake, and discovered a horrid mouth, from
which were vomited furiously smoke, fire, stones, and mud, composed of
ashes, making at the time of its opening a noise like the loudest thunder.
The stones which followed were by the flames converted to pumice,
and some of these were <i>larger than an ox</i>. The stones went about
as high as a cross-bow can carry, and then fell down, sometimes on the
edge, and sometimes into the mouth itself. The mud was of the color
of ashes, and at first very liquid, then by degrees less so, and in such
quantities, that in less than twelve hours, with the help of the above-mentioned
stones, a mountain was raised of 1000 paces in height. Not
only Puzzuoli and the neighboring country was full of this mud, but the
city of Naples also; so that many of its palaces were defaced by it.
Now this eruption lasted two nights and two days without intermission,
though, it is true, not always with the same force; the third day the
eruption ceased, and I went up with many people to the top of the new
hill, and saw down into its mouth, which was a round cavity about a
quarter of a mile in circumference, in the middle of which, the stones
which had fallen were boiling up, just as a caldron of water boils on
the fire. The fourth day it began to throw up again, and the seventh
much more, but still with less violence than the first night. At this
time many persons who were on the hill were knocked down by the
stones and killed, or smothered with the smoke. In the day the smoke
still continues, and you often see fire in the midst of it in the nighttime."<a name="FNanchor_504" id="FNanchor_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a></p>

<p>It will be seen that both these accounts, written immediately after the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
birth of Monte Nuovo, agree in stating that the sea retired; and one
mentions that its bottom was upraised; but they attribute the origin of
the new hill exclusively to the jets of mud, showers of scori&aelig;, and large
fragments of rock, cast out from a central orifice, for several days and
nights. Baron Von Buch, however, in his excellent work on the Canary
Islands, and volcanic phenomena in general, has declared his opinion
that the cone and crater of Monte Nuovo were formed, not in the manner
above described, but by the upheaval of solid beds of white tuff,
which were previously horizontal, but which were pushed up in 1538,
so as to dip away in all directions from the centre, with the same inclination
as the sloping surface of the cone itself. "It is an error," he
says, "to imagine that this hill was formed by eruption, or by the ejection
of pumice, scori&aelig;, and other incoherent matter; for the solid beds
of upraised tuff are visible all round the crater, and it is merely the superficial
covering of the cone which is made up of ejected scori&aelig;."<a name="FNanchor_505" id="FNanchor_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></p>

<p>In confirmation of this view, M. Dufr&eacute;noy has cited a passage from
the works of Porzio, a celebrated physician of that period, to prove
that in 1538 the ground where Monte Nuovo stands was pushed up in
the form of a great bubble or blister, which on bursting, gave origin to
the present deep crater. Porzio, says, "that after two days and nights
of violent earthquakes, the sea retired for nearly 200 yards; so that the
inhabitants could collect great numbers of fish on this part of the
shore, and see some springs of fresh water which rose up there. At
length, on the third day of the calends of October (September 29), they
saw a large tract of ground intervening between the foot of Monte Barbaro,
and part of the sea, near the Lake Avernus, rise, and suddenly
assume the form of an incipient hill; and at two o'clock at night, this
heap of earth, opening as it were its mouth, vomited, with a loud noise,
flames, pumice-stones, and ashes."<a name="FNanchor_506" id="FNanchor_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a></p>

<p>So late as the year 1846 a fourth manuscript (written immediately
after the eruption) was discovered and published in Germany. It was
written in 1538 by Francesco del Nero,<a name="FNanchor_507" id="FNanchor_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> who mentions the drying up
of the bed of the sea near Puzzuoli, which enabled the inhabitants of
the town to carry off loads of fish. About eight o'clock in the morning
of the 29th September, the earth sunk down about 14 feet in that
place where the volcanic orifice now appears, and there issued forth a
small stream of water, at first cold, and afterwards tepid. At noon, on
the same day, the earth began to swell up in the same spot where it
had sunk down 14 feet, so as to form a hill. About this time fire
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">370</a></span>
issued forth, and gave rise to the great gulf, "with such a force, noise,
and shining light, that I, who was standing in my garden, was seized
with terror. Forty minutes afterwards, although unwell, I got upon a
neighboring height, from which I saw all that took place, and by my
troth it was a splendid fire, that threw up for a long time much earth
and many stones, which fell back again all round the gulf, in a semicircle
of from one to three bow-shots in diameter, and, filling up part of
the sea, formed a hill nearly of the height of Monte Morello. Masses
of earth and stones, as large as an ox, were shot up from the fiery gulf
into the air, to a height which I estimate at a mile and a half. When
they descended, some were dry, others in a soft muddy state." He
concludes by alluding again to the sinking of the ground, and the elevation
of it which followed, and says that to him it was inconceivable how
such a mass of stones and ashes could have been poured forth from the
gulf. He also refers to the account which Porzio was to draw up for
the Viceroy.</p>

<p>On comparing these four accounts, recorded by eye-witnesses, there
appears to be no real discrepancy between them. It seems clear that
the ground first sunk down 14 feet on the site of the future volcano,
and after having subsided it was again propelled upwards by the lava
mingled with steam and gases, which were about to burst forth. Jets
of red-hot lava, fragments of fractured rock, and occasionally mud composed
of a mixture of pumice, tuff, and sea-water, were hurled into the
air. Some of the blocks of stone were very large, leading us to infer
that the ground which sank and rose again was much shattered and
torn to pieces by the elastic vapors. The whole hill was not formed at
once, but by an intermittent action extending over a week or more. It
seems that the chasm opened between Tripergola and the baths in its
suburbs, and that the ejected materials fell and buried that small town.
A considerable part, however, of the hill was formed in less than
twenty-four hours, and in the same manner as on a smaller scale the
mud cones of the air volcanoes are produced, with a cavity in the middle.
There is no difficulty in conceiving that the pumiceous mud, if
so thrown out, may have set into a kind of stone on drying, just as
some cements, composed of volcanic ashes, are known to consolidate
with facility.</p>

<p>I am informed that Baron Von Buch discovered some marine shells
of existing species, such as occur fossil in the tuff of the neighborhood,
in beds exposed low down in the walls of the crater of Monte Nuovo.
These may have been ejected in the mud mixed with sea-water which
was cast out of the boiling gulf; or, as Signor Arcangelo Scacchi has
suggested,<a name="FNanchor_508" id="FNanchor_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> they may have been derived from the older tuff, which
contains marine shells of recent species. The same observer remarks
that Porzio's account upon the whole corroborates the doctrine of the
cone having been formed by eruption, in proof of which he cites the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
following passage:&mdash;"But what was truly astonishing, a hill of pumice-stones
and ashes was heaped up round the gulf to the height of a mile
in a single night."<a name="FNanchor_509" id="FNanchor_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> Signor Scacchi also adds that the ancient temple
of Apollo, now at the foot of Monte Nuovo, and the walls of which
still retain their perfect perpendicularity, could not possibly have maintained
that position had the cone of Monte Nuovo really been the result
of upheaval.</p>

<p>Tripergola was much frequented as a watering-place, and contained
a hospital for those who resorted there for the benefit of the thermal
springs; and it appears that there were no fewer than three inns in the
principal street. Had Porzio stated that any of these buildings, or the
ruins of them, were seen by himself or others raised up above the plain,
a short time before the first eruption, so as to stand on the summit or
slope of a newly-raised hillock, we might have been compelled, by so
circumstantial a narrative, to adopt M. Dufr&eacute;noy's interpretation.</p>

<p>But in the absence of such evidence, we must appeal to the crater
itself, where we behold a section of the whole mountain, without being
able to detect any original nucleus of upheaved rock distinct from the
rest; on the contrary, the whole mass is similar throughout in composition,
and the cone very symmetrical in form; nor are there any clefts,
such as might be looked for, as the effect of the sudden upthrow of
stony masses. M. C. Prevost has well remarked, that if beds of solid
and non-elastic materials had yielded to a violent pressure directed from
below upward, we should find not simply a deep empty cavity, but an

<span class="figright" style="width: 250px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 44.</span><a name="f44" id="f44"></a><img src="images/f44.png" width="250" height="163"
alt="Walls of the craters." title="" /></span>

irregular opening, where many rents converged;
and these rents would be now
seen breaking through the walls of the
crater, widening as they approach the
centre. (See Fig. 44, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>.)<a name="FNanchor_510" id="FNanchor_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a> Not a
single fissure of this kind is observable in
the interior of Monte Nuovo, where the
walls of the crater are continuous and entire;
nor are there any dikes implying that
rents had existed, which were afterwards filled with lava or other matter.</p>

<p>It has moreover been often urged by Von Buch, De Beaumont, and
others, who ascribe the conical form of volcanoes chiefly to upheaval
from below, that in such mountains there are a great number of deep
rents and ravines, which diverge on all sides like the spokes of a wheel,
from near the central axis to the circumference or base of the cone, as
in the case of Palma, Cantal, and Teneriffe. Yet the entire absence of
such divergent fissures or ravines, in such cases as Monte Nuovo, Somma,
or Etna, is passed by unnoticed, and appears to have raised in their
minds no objection to their favorite theory.</p>

<p>It is, indeed, admitted by M. Dufr&eacute;noy that there are some facts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>
which it is very difficult to reconcile with his own view of Porzio's record.
Thus, for example, there are certain Roman monuments at the
base of Monte Nuovo, and on the borders of Lake Avernus, such as the
temples of Apollo (before mentioned) and Pluto, which do not seem to
have suffered in the least degree by the supposed upheaval. "The
walls which still exist have preserved their vertical position, and the
vaults are in the same state as other monuments on the shores of the
Bay of Bai&aelig;. The long gallery which led to the Sibyl's Cave, on the
other side of Lake Avernus, has in like manner escaped injury, the roof
of the gallery remaining perfectly horizontal, the only change being that
the soil of the chamber in which the Sibyl gave out her oracles is now
covered by a few inches of water, which merely indicates a slight alteration
in the level of Lake Avernus."<a name="FNanchor_511" id="FNanchor_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> On the supposition, then, that
pre-existing beds of pumiceous tuff were upraised in 1538, so as to form
Monte Nuovo, it is acknowledged that the perfectly undisturbed state
of the contiguous soil on which these ancient monuments stand, is very
different from what might have been expected.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, in his "Volcanic Islands," has described several crateriform
hills in the Galapagos Archipelago as composed of tuff which has
evidently flowed like mud, and yet on consolidating has preserved an
inclination of twenty and even thirty degrees. The tuff does not fold in
continuous sheets round the hills as would have happened if they had
been formed by the upheaval of horizontal layers. The author describes
the composition of the tuff as very similar to that of Monte Nuovo, and
the high angles at which the beds slope, both those which have flowed
and those which have fallen in the form of ashes, entirely removes the
difficulty supposed by M. Dufr&eacute;noy to exist in regard to the slope of
Monte Nuovo, where it exceeds an angle of 18&deg; to 20&deg;.<a name="FNanchor_512" id="FNanchor_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> Mr. Dana,
also, in his account of the Sandwich Islands,<a name="FNanchor_513" id="FNanchor_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> shows that in the "cinder
cones" of that region, the strata have an original inclination of between
35&deg; and 40&deg;, while in the "tufa cones" formed near the sea, the beds
slope at about an angle of 30&deg;. The same naturalist also observed in
the Samoan or Navigator Islands in Polynesia, that fragments of fresh
coral had been thrown up together with volcanic matter to the height of
200 feet above the level of the sea in cones of tufa.<a name="FNanchor_514" id="FNanchor_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a></p>

<p>I shall again revert to the doctrine of the origin of volcanic cones by
upheaval, when speaking of Vesuvius, Etna, and Santorin, and shall now
merely add, that, in 1538, the whole coast, from Monte Nuovo to beyond
Puzzuoli, was upraised to the height of many feet above the bed
of the Mediterranean, and has since retained the greater part of the
elevation then acquired. The proofs of these remarkable changes of
level will be considered at length when the phenomena of the temple of
Serapis are described.<a name="FNanchor_515" id="FNanchor_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span>
<i>Volcanoes of the Phlegr&aelig;an Fields.</i>&mdash;Immediately adjoining Monte
Nuovo is the larger volcanic cone of Monte Barbaro (2, <a href="#f43">fig. 43</a>, p. 367),
the "Gaurus inanis" of Juvenal&mdash;an appellation given to it probably
from its deep circular crater, which is about a mile in diameter. Large
as is this cone, it was probably produced by a single eruption; and it
does not, perhaps, exceed in magnitude some of the largest of those
formed in Ischia, within the historical era. It is composed chiefly of
indurated tufa like Monte Nuovo, stratified conformably to its conical
surface. This hill was once very celebrated for its wines, and is still
covered with vineyards; but when the vine is not in leaf it has a sterile
appearance, and, late in the year, when seen from the beautiful Bay of
Bai&aelig;, it often contrasts so strongly in verdure with Monte Nuovo, which
is always clothed with arbutus, myrtle, and other wild evergreens, that
a stranger might well imagine the cone of older date to be that thrown
up in the sixteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_516" id="FNanchor_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a></p>

<p>There is nothing, indeed, so calculated to instruct the geologist as
the striking manner in which the recent volcanic hills of Ischia, and
that now under consideration, blend with the surrounding landscape.
Nothing seems wanting or redundant; every part of the picture is in
such perfect harmony with the rest, that the whole has the appearance
of having been called into existence by a single effort of creative power.
Yet what other result could we have anticipated if nature has ever been
governed by the same laws? Each new mountain thrown up&mdash;each
new tract of land raised or depressed by earthquakes&mdash;should be in
perfect accordance with those previously formed, if the entire configuration
of the surface has been due to a long series of similar disturbances.
Were it true that the greater part of the dry land originated simultaneously
in its present state, at some era of paroxysmal convulsion, and
that additions were afterwards made slowly and successively during a
period of comparative repose; then, indeed, there might be reason to
expect a strong line of demarcation between the signs of the ancient
and modern changes. But the very continuity of the plan, and the
perfect identity of the causes, are to many a source of deception; since
by producing a unity of effect, they lead them to exaggerate the energy
of the agents which operated in the earlier ages. In the absence of all
historical information, they are as unable to separate the dates of the
origin of different portions of our continents, as the stranger is to determine,
by their physical features alone, the distinct ages of Monte Nuovo,
Monte Barbara, Astroni, and the Solfatara.</p>

<p>The vast scale and violence of the volcanic operations in Campania,
in the olden time, has been a theme of declamation, and has been contrasted
with the comparative state of quiescence of this delightful region
in the modern era. Instead of inferring, from analogy, that the ancient
Vesuvius was always at rest when the craters of the Phlegr&aelig;an Fields
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
were burning&mdash;that each cone rose in succession,&mdash;and that many years,
and often centuries, of repose intervened between different eruptions,&mdash;geologists
seem to have generally conjectured that the whole group
sprung up from the ground at once, like the soldiers of Cadmus when
he sowed the dragon's teeth. As well might they endeavor to persuade
us that on these Phlegr&aelig;an Fields, as the poets feigned, the giants
warred with Jove, ere yet the puny race of mortals were in being.</p>

<p><i>Modern eruptions of Vesuvius.</i>&mdash;For nearly a century after the birth
of Monte Nuovo, Vesuvius continued in a state of tranquillity. There
had been no violent eruption for 492 years; and it appears that the
crater was then exactly in the condition of the present extinct volcano
of Astroni, near Naples. Bracini, who visited Vesuvius not long before
the eruption of 1631, gives the following interesting description of the
interior:&mdash;"The crater was five miles in circumference, and about a
thousand paces deep: its sides were covered with brushwood, and at
the bottom there was a plain on which cattle grazed. In the woody
parts wild boars frequently harbored. In one part of the plain, covered
with ashes, were three small pools, one filled with hot and bitter water,
another salter than the sea, and a third hot, but tasteless."<a name="FNanchor_517" id="FNanchor_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a> But at
length these forests and grassy plains were consumed, being suddenly
blown into the air, and their ashes scattered to the winds. In December,
1631, seven streams of lava poured at once from the crater, and
overflowed several villages, on the flanks and at the foot of the mountain.
Resina, partly built over the ancient site of Herculaneum, was
consumed by the fiery torrent. Great floods of mud were as destructive
as the lava itself,&mdash;no uncommon occurrence during these catastrophes;
for such is the violence of rains produced by the evolutions of
aqueous vapor, that torrents of water descend the cone, and becoming
charged with impalpable volcanic dust, and rolling along loose ashes,
acquire sufficient consistency to deserve their ordinary appellation of
"aqueous lavas."</p>

<p>A brief period of repose ensued, which lasted only until the year
1666, from which time to the present there has been a constant series
of eruptions, with rarely an interval of rest exceeding ten years. During
these three centuries, no irregular volcanic agency has convulsed
other points in this district. Brieslak remarked, that such irregular
convulsions had occurred in the Bay of Naples in every second century;
as, for example, the eruption of the Solfatara, in the twelfth; of the
lava of Arso, in Ischia, in the fourteenth; and of Monte Nuovo in the
sixteenth; but the eighteenth has formed an exception to this rule, and
this seems accounted for by the unprecedented number of eruptions of
Vesuvius during that period; whereas, when the new vents opened,
there had always been, as we have seen, a long intermittence of activity
in the principal volcano.</p>

<p><i>Structure of the cone of Vesuvius.</i>&mdash;Between the end of the eighteenth
century and the year 1822, the great crater of Vesuvius had been
gradually filled by lava boiling up from below, and by scori&aelig; falling
from the explosions of minor mouths which were formed at intervals on
its bottom and sides. In place of a regular cavity, therefore, there
was a rough and rocky plain, covered with blocks of lava and scori&aelig;,
and cut by numerous fissures, from which clouds of vapor were evolved.
But this state of things was totally changed by the eruption of October,
1822, when violent explosions, during the space of more than
twenty days, broke up and threw out all this accumulated mass, so as
to leave an immense gulf or chasm, of an irregular, but somewhat elliptical
shape, about three miles in circumference when measured along
the very sinuous and irregular line of its extreme margin, but somewhat
less than three quarters of a mile in its longest diameter, which was directed
from N. E. to S. W.<a name="FNanchor_518" id="FNanchor_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a> The depth of this tremendous abyss has
been variously estimated; for from the hour of its formation it increased
daily by the dilapidation of its sides. It measured, at first, according
to the account of some authors, two thousand feet in depth from the
extreme part of the existing summit;<a name="FNanchor_519" id="FNanchor_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a> but Mr. Scrope, when he saw it,
soon after the eruption, estimated its depth at less than half that
amount. More than eight hundred feet of the cone was carried away
by the explosions, so that the mountain was reduced in height from
about 4200 to 3400 feet.<a name="FNanchor_520" id="FNanchor_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a></p>

<p>As we ascend the sloping sides, the volcano appears a mass of loose
materials&mdash;a mere heap of rubbish, thrown together without the slightest
order; but on arriving at the brim of the crater, and obtaining a
view of the interior, we are agreeably surprised to discover that the
conformation of the whole displays in every part the most perfect symmetry
and arrangement. The materials are disposed in regular strata,
slightly undulating, appearing, when viewed in front, to be disposed in
horizontal planes. But, as we make the circuit of the edge of the crater,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
and observe the cliffs by which it is encircled projecting or receding
in salient or retiring angles, we behold transverse sections of the currents
of lava and beds of sand and scori&aelig;, and recognize their true dip. We
then discover that they incline outwards from the axis of the cone, at
angles varying from 30&deg; to 40&deg;. The whole cone, in fact, is composed
of a number of concentric coatings of alternating lavas, sand, and scori&aelig;.
Every shower of ashes which has fallen from above, and every
stream of lava descending from the lips of the crater, have conformed
to the outward surface of the hill, so that one conical envelope may be
said to have been successively folded round another, until the aggregation
of the whole mountain was completed. The marked separation
into distinct beds results from the different colors and degrees of coarseness
in the sands, scori&aelig;, and lava, and the alternation of these with
each other. The greatest difficulty, on the first view, is to conceive
how so much regularity can be produced, notwithstanding the unequal
distribution of sand and scori&aelig;, driven by prevailing winds in particular
eruptions, and the small breadth of each sheet of lava as it first flows
out from the crater.</p>

<p>But, on a closer examination, we find that the appearance of extreme
uniformity is delusive; for when a number of beds thin out gradually,
and at different points, the eye does not without difficulty recognize
the termination of any one stratum, but usually supposes it continuous
with some other, which at a short distance may lie precisely in the
same plane. The slight undulations, moreover, produced by inequalities
on the sides of the hill on which the successive layers were
moulded, assist the deception. As countless beds of sand and scori&aelig;
constitute the greater part of the whole mass, these may sometimes
mantle continuously round the whole cone; and even lava streams may
be of considerable breadth when first they overflow, and since, in some
eruptions, a considerable part of the upper portion of the cone breaks
down at once, may form a sheet extending as far as the space which
the eye usually takes in, in a single section.</p>

<p>The high inclination of some of the beds, and the firm union of the
particles even where there is evidently no cement, is another striking
feature in the volcanic tuffs and breccias, which seems at first not very
easy of explanation. But the last great eruption afforded ample illustration
of the manner in which these strata are formed. Fragments of
lava, scori&aelig;, pumice, and sand, when they fall at slight distances from the
summit, are only half cooled down from a state of fusion, and are afterwards
acted upon by the heat from within, and by fumeroles or small
crevices in the cone through which hot vapors are disengaged. Thus
heated, the ejected fragments cohere together strongly; and the whole
mass acquires such consistency in a few days, that fragments cannot be
detached without a smart blow of the hammer. At the same time sand
and scori&aelig;, ejected to a greater distance, remain incoherent.<a name="FNanchor_521" id="FNanchor_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">377</a></span>
Sir William Hamilton, in his description of the eruption of 1779,
says that jets of liquid lava, mixed with stones and scori&aelig;, were thrown
up to the height of at least ten thousand feet, having the appearance of
a column of fire.<a name="FNanchor_522" id="FNanchor_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a> Some of these were directed by the winds towards
Ottajano, and some of them falling almost perpendicularly, still red-hot
and liquid, on Vesuvius, covered its whole cone, part of the mountain
of Somma, and the valley between them. The falling matter being
nearly as vividly inflamed as that which was continually issuing fresh
from the crater, formed with it one complete body of fire, which could
not be less than two miles and a half in breadth, and of the extraordinary
height above mentioned, casting a heat to the distance of at least
six miles round it. Dr. Clarke, also, in his account of the eruption of
1793, says that millions of red-hot stones were shot into the air full
half the height of the cone itself, and then bending, fell all round in a
fine arch. On another occasion he says that, as they fell, they covered
nearly half the cone with fire.</p>

<p>The same author has also described the different appearance of the
lava at its source, and at some distance from it, when it had descended
into the plains below. At the point where it issued, in 1793, from an
arched chasm in the side of the mountain, the vivid torrent rushed
with the velocity of a flood. It was in perfect fusion, unattended with
any scori&aelig; on its surface, or any gross materials not in a state of complete
solution. It flowed with the translucency of honey, "in regular
channels, cut finer than art can imitate, and glowing with all the splendor
of the sun."&mdash;"Sir William Hamilton," he continues, "had conceived
that no stones thrown upon a current of lava would make any
impression. I was soon convinced of the contrary. Light bodies,
indeed, of five, ten, and fifteen pounds' weight, made little or no impression
even at the source; but bodies of sixty, seventy, and eighty
pounds were seen to form a kind of bed on the surface of the lava, and
float away with it. A stone of three hundred weight, that had been
thrown out by the crater, lay near the source of the current of lava: I
raised it upon one end, and then let it fall in upon the liquid lava;
when it gradually sunk beneath the surface, and disappeared. If I
wished to describe the manner in which it acted upon the lava, I should
say that it was like a loaf of bread thrown into a bowl of very thick
honey, which gradually involves itself in the heavy liquid, and then
slowly sinks to the bottom.</p>

<p>"The lava, at a small distance from its source, acquires a darker tint
upon its surface, is less easily acted upon, and, as the stream widens,
the surface, having lost its state of perfect solution, grows harder and
harder, and cracks into innumerable fragments of very porous matter,
to which they give the name of scori&aelig;, and the appearance of which
has led many to suppose that it proceeded thus from the mountain.
There is, however, no truth in this. All lava, at its first exit from its
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">378</a></span>
native volcano, flows out in a liquid state, and all equally in fusion.
The appearance of the scori&aelig; is to be attributed only to the action of
the external air, and not to any difference in the materials which compose
it, since any lava whatever, separated from its channel, and exposed
to the action of the external air, immediately cracks, becomes
porous, and alters its form. As we proceeded downwards, this became
more and more evident; and the same lava which at its original source
flowed in perfect solution, undivided, and free from incumbrances of
any kind, a little farther down had its surface loaded with scori&aelig; in
such a manner, that, upon its arrival at the bottom of the mountain,
the whole current resembled nothing so much as a heap of unconnected
cinders from an iron-foundry." In another place he says that "the rivers
of lava in the plain resembled a vast heap of cinders, or the scori&aelig; of
an iron-foundry, rolling slowly along, and falling with a rattling noise
over one another."<a name="FNanchor_523" id="FNanchor_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a> Von Buch, who was in company with MM. de
Humboldt and Gay-Lussac, describes the lava of 1805 (the most fluid
on record) as shooting suddenly before their eyes from top to bottom
of the cone in one single instant. Professor J. D. Forbes remarks that
the length of the slope of the cone proper being about 1300 feet, this
motion must correspond to a velocity of many hundred feet in a few
seconds, without interpreting Von Buch's expression literally. The
same lava, when it reached the level road at Torre del Greco, moved at
the rate of only eighteen inches per minute, or three-tenths of an inch
per second.<a name="FNanchor_524" id="FNanchor_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a> "Although common lava," observes Professor Forbes,
"is nearly as liquid as melted iron, when it issues from the orifice of the
crater, its fluidity rapidly diminishes, and as it becomes more and more
burdened by the consolidated slag through which it has to force its
way, its velocity of motion diminishes in an almost inconceivable degree;
and at length, when it ceases to present the slightest external trace of
fluidity, its movement can only be ascertained by careful and repeated
observations, just as in the case of a glacier."<a name="FNanchor_525" id="FNanchor_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a></p>

<p>It appears that the intensity of the light and heat of the lava varies
considerably at different periods of the same eruption, as in that of
Vesuvius in 1819 and 1820, when Sir H. Davy remarked different
degrees of vividness in the white heat at the point where the lava
originated.<a name="FNanchor_526" id="FNanchor_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a></p>

<p>When the expressions "flame" and "smoke" are used in describing
volcanic appearances, they must generally be understood in a figurative
sense. We are informed, indeed, by M. Abich, that he distinctly saw,
in the eruption of Vesuvius in 1834, the flame of burning
hydrogen;<a name="FNanchor_527" id="FNanchor_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a>
but what is usually mistaken for flame consists of vapor or scori&aelig;, and
impalpable dust illuminated by that vivid light which is emitted from
the crater below, where the lava is said to glow with the splendor of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
the sun. The clouds of apparent smoke are formed either of aqueous
and other vapor, or of finely comminuted scori&aelig;.</p>

<p><i>Dikes in the recent cone, how formed.</i>&mdash;The inclined strata before
mentioned which dip outwards in all directions from the axis of the
cone of Vesuvius, are intersected by veins or dikes of compact lava, for
the most part in a vertical position. In 1828 these were seen to be
about seven in number, some of them not less than four or five hundred
feet in height, and thinning out before they reached the uppermost part
of the cone. Being harder than the beds through which they pass,
they have decomposed less rapidly, and therefore stand out in relief.
When I visited Vesuvius, in November, 1828, I was prevented from
descending into the crater by the constant ejections then thrown out;
so that I got sight of three only of the dikes; but Signor Monticelli had
previously had drawings made of the whole, which he showed me. The
dikes which I saw were on that side of the cone which is encircled by
Somma. The eruption before mentioned, of 1828, began in March, and
in the November following the ejected matter had filled up nearly one-third
of the deep abyss formed at the close of the eruption of 1822. In
November I found a single black cone at the bottom of the crater continually
throwing out scori&aelig;, while on the exterior of the cone I observed
the lava of 1822, which had flowed out six years before, not yet
cool, and still evolving much heat and vapor from crevices.</p>

<p>Hoffmann, in 1832, saw on the north side of Vesuvius, near the
peak called Palo, a great many parallel bands of lava, some from six to
eight feet thick, alternating with scori&aelig; and conglomerate. These beds,
he says, were cut through by many dikes, some of them five feet broad.
They resemble those of Somma, the stone being composed of grains of
leucite and augite.<a name="FNanchor_528" id="FNanchor_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that the dikes above mentioned have been
produced by the filling up of open fissures with liquid lava; but of the
date of their formation we know nothing farther than that they are all
subsequent to the year 79, and, relatively speaking, that they are more
modern than all the lavas and scori&aelig; which they intersect. A considerable
number of the upper strata are not traversed by them. That the
earthquakes, which almost invariably precede eruptions, occasion rents
in the mass, is well known; and, in 1822, three months before the lava
flowed out, open fissures, evolving hot vapors, were numerous. It is
clear that such rents must be ejected with melted matter when the column
of lava rises, so that the origin of the dikes is easily explained, as
also the great solidity and crystalline nature of the rock composing them,
which has been formed by lava cooling slowly under great pressure.</p>

<p>It has been suggested that the frequent rending of volcanic cones
during eruptions may be connected with the gradual and successive
upheaval of the whole mass in such a manner as to increase the inclination
of the beds composing the cone; and in accordance with the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">380</a></span>
hypothesis before proposed for the origin of Monte Nuovo, Von Buch
supposes that the present cone of Vesuvius was formed in the year 79,
not by eruption, but by upheaval. It was not produced by the repeated
superposition of scori&aelig; and lava cast out or flowing from a central
source, but by the uplifting of strata previously horizontal. The
entire cone rose at once, such as we now see it, from the interior and
middle of Somma, and has since received no accession of height, but, on
the contrary, has ever since been diminishing in elevation.<a name="FNanchor_529" id="FNanchor_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a></p>

<p>Although I consider this hypothesis of Von Buch to be quite untenable,
I may mention some facts which may at first sight seem to favor it.
These are recorded by M. Abich in his account of the Vesuvian eruptions
of 1833 and 1834, a work illustrated by excellent engravings of
the volcanic phenomena which he witnessed.<a name="FNanchor_530" id="FNanchor_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a> It appears that, in the
year 1834, the great crater of Vesuvius had been filled up nearly to the
top with lava, which had consolidated and formed a level and unbroken
plain, except that a small cone thrown up by the ejection of scori&aelig; rose
in the middle of it like an island in a lake. At length this plain of lava
was broken by a fissure which passed from N. E. to S. W., and along
this line a great number of minute cones emitting vapor were formed.
The first act of formation of these minor cones is said to have consisted
of a partial upheaval of beds of lava previously horizontal, and which
had been rendered flexible by the heat and tension of elastic fluids,
which, rising from below, escaped from the centre of each new monticule.
There would be considerable analogy between this mode of origin
and that ascribed by Von Buch to Vesuvius and Somma, if the
dimensions of the upraised masses were not on so different a scale, and
if it was safe to reason from the inflation of bladders of half-fused lava,
from fifteen to twenty-five feet in height, to mountains attaining an altitude
of several thousand feet, and having their component strata strengthened
by intersecting dikes of solid lava.</p>

<p>At the same time M. Abich mentions, that when, in August, 1834,
a great subsidence took place in the platform of lava within the great
crater, so that the structure of the central cone was laid open, it was
seen to have been evidently formed, <i>not by upheaval</i>, but by the fall
of cinders and scori&aelig; which had been thrown out during successive
eruptions.<a name="FNanchor_531" id="FNanchor_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a></p>

<p>Previous to the year 79, Vesuvius appears, from the description of
its figure given by Strabo, to have been a truncated cone, having a level
and even outline as seen from a distance. That it had a crater on its
summit, we may infer from a passage in Plutarch, on which Dr. Daubeny
has judiciously commented in his treatise on volcanoes.<a name="FNanchor_532" id="FNanchor_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a> The walls
of the crater were evidently entire, except on one side, where there was
a single narrow breach. When Spartacus, in the year 72, encamped his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
gladiators in this hollow, Clodius, the pr&aelig;tor, besieged him there, keeping
the single outlet carefully guarded, and then let down his soldiers
by scaling-ladders over the steep precipices which surrounded the crater,
at the bottom of which the insurgents were encamped. On the
side towards the sea, the walls of this original cavity, which must have
been three miles in diameter, have been destroyed, and Brieslak was the
first to announce the opinion, that this destruction happened during the
tremendous eruption which occurred in 79, when the new cone, now
called Vesuvius, was thrown up, which stands encircled on three sides
by the ruins of the ancient cone, called Monte Somma.</p>

<p>In the annexed diagram (<a href="#f45">fig. 45</a>) it will be seen that on the side of
Vesuvius opposite to that where a portion of the ancient cone of Somma
(<i>a</i>) still remains, is a projection (<i>b</i>) called the Pedamentina, which some
have supposed to be part of the circumference of the ancient crater
broken down towards the sea, and over the edge of which the lavas of
the modern Vesuvius have poured; the axis of the present cone of Vesuvius
being, according to Visconti, precisely equidistant from the
escarpment of Somma and the Pedamentina.</p>

<p>In the same diagram I have represented the slanting beds of the cone
of Vesuvius as becoming horizontal in the Atrio del Cavallo (at <i>c</i>),
where the base of the new cone meets the precipitous escarpment of
Somma; for when the lava flows down to this point, as happened in
1822, its descending course is arrested, and it then runs in another
direction along this small valley, circling round the base of the cone.
Sand and scori&aelig;, also, blown by the winds, collect at the base of the
cone, and are then swept away by torrents; so that there is always
here a flatish plain, as represented. In the same manner, the small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span>
interior cone (<i>f</i>) must be composed of sloping beds, terminating in a
horizontal plain; for, while this monticule was gradually gaining height
by successive ejections of lava and scori&aelig;, in 1828, it was always surrounded
by a flat pool of semi-fluid lava, into which scori&aelig; and sand
were thrown.</p>

<p>In the steep simicircular escarpment of Somma, which faces the
modern Vesuvius, we see a great number of sheets of lava inclined at
an angle of about 26&deg;. They alternate with scori&aelig;, and are intersected
by numerous dikes, which, like the sheets of lava, are composed chiefly
of augite, with crystals of leucite, but the rock in the dikes is more
compact, having cooled and consolidated under greater pressure. Some
of the dikes cut through and shift others, so that they have evidently
been formed during successive eruptions. While the higher region of
Somma is made up of these igneous products, there appear on its flanks,
for some depth from the surface, as seen in a ravine called the "Fossa
Grande," beds of white pumiceous tuff, resembling the tuff which, at
Pausilippo, and other places, near Naples, contain shells of living
Mediterranean species. It is supposed by Pilla, Von Buch, and others,
that the tufaceous beds, which rise in Somma to more than half the
height of that mountain, are, in like manner, of submarine origin, because
a few sea-shells have been found in them, here and there, together
with serpul&aelig; of recent species attached to included blocks of
limestone.<a name="FNanchor_534" id="FNanchor_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a></p>

<p>It is contended, therefore, that as these strata were once accumulated
beneath the sea, they may have been subjected as they rose to such an
upward movement as may have given rise to a conical hill; and this
hypothesis, it is said, acquires confirmation from the fact, that the sheets
of lava near the summit of Somma are so compact and crystalline, and
of such breadth individually, as would not have been the case had they
run down a steep slope. They must, therefore, have consolidated on a
nearly level surface, and have been subsequently uplifted into their present
inclined position.</p>

<p>Unfortunately there are no sections of sufficient depth and continuity
on the flanks of Somma, to reveal to us clearly the relations of the
lava, scori&aelig;, and associated dikes, forming the highest part of the
mountain, with the marine tuffs observed on its declivity. Both
may, perhaps, have been produced contemporaneously when Somma
raised its head, like Stromboli, above the sea, its sides and base being
then submerged. Such a state of things may be indicated by a fact
noticed by Von Buch, namely, that the pumiceous beds of Naples,
when they approach Somma, contain fragments of the peculiar leucitic
lava proper to that mountain, which are not found in the same tuff at a
greater distance.<a name="FNanchor_535" id="FNanchor_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a> Portions, therefore, of this lava were either thrown
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>
out by explosions, or torn off by the waves, during the deposition of the
pumiceous strata beneath the sea.</p>

<p>We have as yet but a scanty acquaintance with the laws which regulate
the flow of lava beneath water, or the arrangement of scori&aelig; and
volcanic dust on the sides of a submarine cone. There can, however,
be little doubt that showers of ejected matter may settle on a steep
slope, and may include shells and the remains of aquatic animals, which
flourish in the intervals between eruptions. Lava under the pressure of
water would be less porous; but, as Dr. Daubeny suggests, it may
retain its fluidity longer than in the open air; for the rapidity with
which heated bodies are cooled by being plunged into water arises
chiefly from the conversion of the lower portions of water into steam,
which steam absorbing much heat, immediately ascends, and is reconverted
into water. But under the pressure of a deep ocean, the heat
of the lava would be carried off more slowly, and only by the circulation
of ascending and descending currents of water, those portions nearest
the source of heat becoming specifically light, and consequently displacing
the water above. This kind of circulation would take place
with much less rapidity than in the atmosphere, inasmuch as the expansion
of water by equal increments of heat is less considerable than
that of air.<a name="FNanchor_536" id="FNanchor_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a></p>

<p>We learn from the valuable observations made by Mr. Dana on the
active volcanoes of the Sandwich Islands, that large sheets of compact
basaltic lava have been poured out of craters at the top or near the summits
of flattened domes higher than Etna, as in the case of Mount Loa
for example, where a copious stream two miles broad and twenty-five
miles long proceeded from an opening 13,000 feet above the level of the
sea. The usual slope of these sheets of lava is between 5&deg; and 10&deg;;
but Mr. Dana convinced himself that, owing to the suddenness with which
they cool in the air, some lavas may occasionally form on slopes equalling
25&deg;, and still preserve a considerable compactness of texture. It is even
proved, he says, from what he saw in the great lateral crater of Kilauea,
on the flanks of Mount Loa, that a mass of such melted rock may consolidate
at an inclination of 30&deg;, and be continuous for 300 or 400 feet.
Such masses are narrow, he admits, "but if the source had been more
generous, they would have had a greater breadth, and by a succession
of ejections overspreading each cooled layer, a considerable thickness
might have been attained."<a name="FNanchor_537" id="FNanchor_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a> The same author has also shown, as before
mentioned, that in the "cinder cones" of the Sandwich Islands, the
strata have an original inclination of between 35&deg; and 40&deg;.<a name="FNanchor_538" id="FNanchor_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a></p>

<p>Mr. Scrope, writing in 1827, attributed the formation of a volcanic
cone chiefly to matter ejected from a central orifice, but partly to the
injection of lava into dikes, and "to that force of gaseous expansion, the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span>
intensity of which, in the central parts of the cone, is attested by local
earthquakes, which so often accompany eruptions.<a name="FNanchor_539" id="FNanchor_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a> It is the opinion
of MM. Von Buch, De Beaumont, and Dufr&eacute;noy, that the sheets of
lava on Somma are so uniform and compact, that their original inclination
did not exceed four or five degrees, and that four-fifths, therefore,
of their present slope is due to their having been subsequently tilted
and upraised. Notwithstanding the light thrown by M. de Beaumont
on the laws regulating the flow and consolidation of lava, I do not conceive
that these laws are as yet sufficiently determined to warrant us in
assigning so much of the inclined position of the beds of Somma to the
subsequent rending and dislocation of the cone. Even if this were admitted,
it is far more in harmony with the usual mode of development
of volcanic forces to suppose the movement which modified the shape of
the cone to have been intermittent and gradual, and not to have consisted
of a single effort, or one sudden and violent convulsion.<a name="FNanchor_540" id="FNanchor_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a></p>

<p><i>Vesuvian lavas.</i>&mdash;The lavas of Somma are characterized by containing
disseminated crystals of leucite (called, by the French, amphig&egrave;ne),
a mineral said to be very rare in the modern lavas of Vesuvius, which
are in general much more scoriaceous and less crystalline than those of
Somma.<a name="FNanchor_541" id="FNanchor_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a></p>

<p>At the fortress near Torre del Greco a section is exposed, fifteen feet
in height, of a current which ran into the sea; and it evinces, especially
in the lower part, a decided tendency to divide into rude columns. A
still more striking example may be seen to the west of Torre del Annunziata,
near Forte Scassato, where the mass is laid open to the depth
of twenty feet. In both these cases, however, the rock may rather be
said to be divided into numerous perpendicular fissures, than to be prismatic,
although the same picturesque effect is produced. In the lava-currents
of Central France (those of the Vivarais, in particular), the
uppermost portion, often forty feet or more in thickness, is an amorphous
mass passing downwards into lava irregularly prismatic; and under this
there is a foundation of regular and vertical columns; but these lavas
are often one hundred feet or more in thickness. We can scarcely expect
to discover the same phenomenon in the shallow currents of Vesuvius,
where the lowest part has cooled more rapidly, although it may
be looked for in modern streams in Iceland, which exceed even those of
ancient France in volume.</p>

<p>Mr. Scrope mentions that, in the cliffs encircling the modern crater
of Vesuvius, he saw many currents offering a columnar division, and some
almost as regularly prismatic as any ranges of the older basalts; and
he adds, that in some the spheroidal concretionary structure, on a large
scale, was equally conspicuous.<a name="FNanchor_542" id="FNanchor_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a> Brieslak<a name="FNanchor_543" id="FNanchor_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> also informs us that, in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span>
siliceous lava of 1737, which contains augite, leucite, and crystals of
felspar, he found very regular prisms in a quarry near Torre del Greco;
an observation confirmed by modern authorities.<a name="FNanchor_544" id="FNanchor_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a></p>

<p><i>Effects of decomposition on lavas.</i>&mdash;The decomposition of some of the
felspathic lavas, either by simple weathering, or by gaseous emanations,
converts them from a hard to a soft clayey state, so that they no longer
retain the smallest resemblance to rocks cooled down from a state of
fusion. The exhalations of sulphuretted hydrogen and muriatic acid,
which are disengaged continually from the Solfatara, also produce curious
changes on the trachyte of that nearly extinct volcano: the rock is
bleached, and becomes porous, fissile, and honey-combed, till at length
it crumbles into a white siliceous powder.<a name="FNanchor_545" id="FNanchor_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a> Numerous globular concretions,
composed of concentric lamin&aelig;, are also formed by the same
vapors in this decomposed rock.<a name="FNanchor_546" id="FNanchor_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a></p>

<p><i>Vesuvian minerals.</i>&mdash;A great variety of minerals are found in the
lavas of Vesuvius and Somma; augite, leucite, felspar, mica, olivine,
and sulphur are most abundant. It is an extraordinary fact, that in an
area of three square miles round Vesuvius, a greater number of simple
minerals have been found than in any spot of the same dimensions on
the surface of the globe. H&auml;uy enumerated only 380 species of simple
minerals as known to him; and no less than eighty-two had been found
on Vesuvius and in the tuffs on the flanks of Somma before the end of
the year 1828.<a name="FNanchor_547" id="FNanchor_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a> Many of these are peculiar to that locality. Some
mineralogists have conjectured that the greater part of these were not
of Vesuvian origin, but thrown up in fragments from some older formation,
through which the gaseous explosions burst. But none of the
older rocks in Italy, or elsewhere, contain such an assemblage of mineral
products; and the hypothesis seems to have been prompted by a
disinclination to admit that, in times so recent in the earth's history,
the laboratory of nature could have been so prolific in the creation of
new and rare compounds. Had Vesuvius been a volcano of high antiquity,
formed when nature</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Wanton'd as in her prime, and play'd at will</span>
<span class="i0">Her virgin fancies,</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>it would have been readily admitted that these, or a much greater variety
of substances, had been sublimed in the crevices of lava, just as
several new earthy and metallic compounds are known to have been
produced by fumeroles, since the eruption of 1822.</p>

<p><i>Mass enveloping Herculaneum and Pompeii.</i>&mdash;In addition to the
ejections which fall on the cone, and that much greater mass which
finds its way gradually to the neighboring sea, there is a third portion,
often of no inconsiderable thickness, composed of alluviums, spread over
the valleys and plains at small distances from the volcano. Aqueous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
vapors are evolved copiously from volcanic craters during eruptions,
and often for a long time subsequently to the discharge of scori&aelig; and
lava: these vapors are condensed in the cold atmosphere surrounding
the high volcanic peak, and heavy rains are thus caused. The floods
thus occasioned, sweep along the impalpable dust and light scori&aelig;, till
a current of mud is produced, which is called in Campania "lava d'
acqua," and is often more dreaded than an igneous stream (lava di fuoco),
from the greater velocity with which it moves. So late as the 27th
of October, 1822, one of these alluviums descended the cone of Vesuvius,
and, after overspreading much cultivated soil, flowed suddenly
into the villages of St. Sebastian and Massa, where, filling the streets
and interior of some of the houses, it suffocated seven persons. It will,
therefore, happen very frequently that, towards the base of a volcanic
cone, alternations will be found of lava, alluvium, and showers of
ashes.</p>

<p>To which of these two latter divisions the mass enveloping Herculaneum
and Pompeii should be referred, has been a question of the keenest
controversy; but the discussion might have been shortened, if the
combatants had reflected that, whether volcanic sand and ashes were
conveyed to the towns by running water, or through the air, during an
eruption, the interior of buildings, so long as the roofs remain entire,
together with all underground vaults and cellars, could be filled only
by an alluvium. We learn from history, that a heavy shower of sand,
pumice, and lapilli, sufficiently great to render Pompeii and Herculaneum
uninhabitable, fell for eight successive days and nights in the year
79, accompanied by violent rains.<a name="FNanchor_548" id="FNanchor_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> We ought, therefore, to find a very
close resemblance between the strata covering these towns and those
composing the minor cones of the Phlegr&aelig;an Fields, accumulated rapidly,
like Monte Nuovo, during a continued shower of ejected matter;
with this difference however, that the strata incumbent on the cities
would be horizontal, whereas those on the cones are highly inclined;
and that large angular fragments of rock, which are thrown out near the
vent, would be wanting at a distance where small lapilli only can be
found. Accordingly, with these exceptions, no identity can be more
perfect than the form, and distribution of the matter at the base of
Monte Nuovo, as laid open by the encroaching sea, and the appearance
of the beds superimposed on Pompeii. That city is covered with numerous
alternations of different horizontal beds of tuff and lapilli, for the
most part thin, and subdivided into very fine layers. I observed the
following section near the amphitheatre, in November, 1828&mdash;(descending

<p>Many of the ashes in these beds are vitrified, and harsh to the touch.
Crystals of leucite, both fresh and farinaceous, have been found intermixed.<a name="FNanchor_549" id="FNanchor_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a>
The depth of the bed of ashes above the houses is variable,
but seldom exceeds twelve or fourteen feet, and it is said that the higher
part of the amphitheatre always projected above the surface; though if
this were the case, it seems inexplicable that the city should never have
been discovered till the year 1750. It will be observed in the above
section that two of the brown, half-consolidated tuffs are filled with small
pisolitic globules. This circumstance is not alluded to in the animated
controversy which the Royal Academy of Naples maintained with one
of their members, Signor Lippi, as to the origin of the strata incumbent
on Pompeii. The mode of aggregation of these globules has been fully
explained by Mr. Scrope, who saw them formed in great numbers in
1822, by rain falling during the eruption on fine volcanic sand, and sometimes
also produced like hail in the air, by the mutual attraction of the
minutest particles of fine damp sand. Their occurrence, therefore, agrees
remarkably well with the account of heavy rain, and showers of sand and
ashes recorded in history.<a name="FNanchor_550" id="FNanchor_550"></a><a href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a></p>

<p>Lippi entitled his work, "F&ugrave; il fuoco o l' acqua che sotter&ograve; Pompei ed
Ercolano?"<a name="FNanchor_551" id="FNanchor_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a> and he contended that neither were the two cities destroyed
in the year 79, nor by a volcanic eruption, but purely by the agency of
water charged with transported matter. His letters, wherein he endeavored
to dispense, as far as possible, with igneous agency, even at the
foot of the volcano, were dedicated, with great propriety, to Werner,
and afford an amusing illustration of the polemic style in which geological
writers of that day indulged themselves. His arguments were partly
of an historical nature, derived from the silence of contemporary historians,
respecting the fate of the cities, which, as we have already stated,
is most remarkable, and partly drawn from physical proofs. He pointed
out with great clearness the resemblance of the tufaceous matter in the
vaults and cellars at Herculaneum and Pompeii to aqueous alluviums,
and its distinctness from ejections which had fallen through the air.
Nothing, he observes, but moist pasty matter could have received the
impression of a woman's breast, which was found in a vault at Pompeii,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
or have given the cast of a statue discovered in the theatre at Herculaneum.
It was objected to him, that the heat of the tuff in Herculaneum
and Pompeii was proved by the carbonization of the timber, corn, papyrus-rolls,
and other vegetable substances there discovered; but Lippi
replied with truth, that the papyri would have been burnt up if they
had come in contact with fire, and that their being only carbonized was
a clear demonstration of their having been enveloped, like fossil wood,
in a sediment deposited from water. The Academicians, in their report
on his pamphlet, assert, that when the amphitheatre was first cleared
out, the matter was arranged on the steps in a succession of concave
layers, accommodating themselves to the interior form of the building,
just as snow would lie if it had fallen there. This observation is highly
interesting, and points to the difference between the stratification of ashes
in an open building and of mud derived from the same in the interior of
edifices and cellars. Nor ought we to call the allegation in question,
because it could not be substantiated at the time of the controversy after
the matter had been all removed; although Lippi took advantage of
this removal, and met the argument of his antagonists by requiring them
to prove the fact. There is decisive evidence that no stream of lava has
ever reached Pompeii since it was first built, although the foundations
of the town stand upon the old leucitic lava of Somma; several streams
of which, with tuff interposed, had been cut through in excavations.</p>

<p><i>Infusorial beds covering Pompeii.</i>&mdash;A most singular and unexpected
discovery has been recently made (1844-5) by Professor Ehrenberg,
respecting the remote origin of many of the layers of ashes and pumice
enveloping Pompeii. They are, he says, in great part, of organic and
freshwater origin, consisting of the siliceous cases of microscopic infusoria.
What is still more surprising, this fact proves to be by no means
an isolated or solitary example of an intimate relation between organic
life and the results of volcanic activity. On the Rhine, several beds of
tuff and pumiceous conglomerate, resembling the mass incumbent upon
Pompeii and closely connected with extinct volcanoes, are now ascertained
to be made up to a great extent of the siliceous cases of infusoria
(or Diatomace&aelig;), invisible to the naked eye, and often half
fused.<a name="FNanchor_552" id="FNanchor_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a> No
less than 94 distinct species have already been detected in one mass of
this kind, more than 150 feet thick, at Hochsimmer, on the left bank of
the Rhine, near the Laacher-see. Some of these Rhenish infusorial
accumulations appear to have fallen in showers, others to have been
poured out of lake-craters in the form of mud, as in the Brohl valley.</p>

<p>In Mexico, Peru, the Isle of France, and several other volcanic regions,
analogous phenomena have been observed, and everywhere the species
of infusoria belong to freshwater and terrestrial genera, except in the
case of the Patagonian pumiceous tuffs, specimens of which, brought
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>
home by Mr. Darwin, are found to contain the remains of marine animalcules.
In various kinds of pumice ejected by volcanoes, the microscope
has revealed to Professor Ehrenberg the siliceous cases of infusoria
often half obliterated by the action of heat, and the fine dust thrown out
into the air during eruptions, is sometimes referable to these most minute
organic substances, brought up from considerable depths, and sometimes
mingled with small particles of vegetable matter.</p>

<p>In what manner did the solid coverings of these most minute plants
and animalcules, which can only originate and increase at the surface
of the earth, sink down and penetrate into subterranean cavities, so as
to be ejected from the volcanic orifices? We have of late years become
familiar with the fact, in the process of boring Artesian wells, that the
seeds of plants, the remains of insects, and even small fish, with other
organic bodies, are carried in an uninjured state by the underground
circulation of waters, to the depth of many hundred feet. With still
greater facility in a volcanic region we may conjecture, that water and
mud full of invisible infusoria may be sucked down, from time to time,
into subterranean rents and hollows in cavernous lava which has been
permeated by gases, or in rocks dislocated by earthquakes. It often
happens that a lake which has endured for centuries in a volcanic crater,
disappears suddenly on the approach of a new eruption. Violent
shocks agitate the surrounding region, and ponds, rivers, and wells are
dried up. Large cavities far below may thus become filled with fen-mud
chiefly composed of the more indestructible and siliceous portions
of infusoria, destined perhaps to be one day ejected in a fragmentary or
half-fused state, yet without the obliteration of all traces of organic
structure.<a name="FNanchor_553" id="FNanchor_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a></p>

<p><i>Herculaneum.</i>&mdash;It was remarked that no lava has flowed over the
site of Pompeii, since that city was built, but with Herculaneum the
case is different. Although the substance which fills the interior of the
houses and the vaults must have been introduced in a state of mud, like
that found in similar situations in Pompeii; yet the superincumbent
mass differs wholly in composition and thickness. Herculaneum was
situated several miles nearer to the volcano, and has, therefore, been always
more exposed to be covered, not only by showers of ashes, but by
alluviums and streams of lava. Accordingly, masses of both have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">390</a></span>
accumulated on each other above the city, to a depth of nowhere less than
70, and in many places of 112 feet.<a name="FNanchor_554" id="FNanchor_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a></p>

<p>The tuff which envelops the buildings consists of comminuted volcanic
ashes, mixed with pumice. A mask imbedded in this matrix has
left a cast, the sharpness of which was compared by Hamilton to those
in plaster of Paris; nor was the mask in the least degree scorched, as
if it had been imbedded in heated matter. This tuff is porous; and,
when first excavated, is soft and easily worked, but acquires a considerable
degree of induration on exposure to the air. Above this lowest
stratum is placed, according to Hamilton, "the matter of six eruptions,"
each separated from the other by veins of good soil. In these soils
Lippi states that he collected a considerable number of land shells&mdash;an
observation which is no doubt correct; for many snails burrow in soft
soils, and some Italian species descend, when they hybernate, to the
depth of five feet and more from the surface. Della Torre also informs
us that there is in one part of this superimposed mass a bed of true
siliceous lava (<i>lava di pietra dura</i>); and, as no such current is believed
to have flowed till near one thousand years after the destruction of Herculaneum,
we must conclude, that the origin of a large part of the covering
of Herculaneum was long subsequent to the first inhumation of
the place. That city, as well as Pompeii, was a seaport. Herculaneum
is still very near the shore, but a tract of land, a mile in length, intervenes
between the borders of the Bay of Naples and Pompeii. In both
cases the gain of land is due to the filling up of the bed of the sea with
volcanic matter, and not to elevation by earthquakes, for there has been
no change in the relative level of land and sea. Pompeii stood on a
slight eminence composed of the lavas of the ancient Vesuvius, and
flights of steps led down to the water's edge. The lowermost of these
steps are said to be still on an exact level with the sea.</p>

<p><i>Condition and contents of the buried cities.</i>&mdash;After these observations
on the nature of the strata enveloping and surrounding the cities, we
may proceed to consider their internal condition and contents, so far at
least as they offer facts of geological interest. Notwithstanding the
much greater depth at which Herculaneum was buried, it was discovered
before Pompeii, by the accidental circumstance of a well being
sunk, in 1713, which came right down upon the theatre, where the statues
of Hercules and Cleopatra were soon found. Whether this city or
Pompeii, both of them founded by Greek colonies, was the more considerable,
is not yet determined; but both are mentioned by ancient
authors as among the seven most flourishing cities in Campania. The
walls of Pompeii were three miles in circumference; but we have, as
yet, no certain knowledge of the dimensions of Herculaneum. In the
latter place the theatre alone is open for inspection; the Forum, Temple
of Jupiter, and other buildings, having been filled up with rubbish as
the workmen proceeded, owing to the difficulty of removing it from so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>
great a depth below ground. Even the theatre is only seen by torchlight,
and the most interesting information, perhaps, which the geologist
obtains there, is the continual formation of stalactite in the galleries cut
through the tuff; for there is a constant percolation of water charged
with carbonate of lime mixed with a small portion of magnesia. Such
mineral waters must, in the course of time, create great changes in
many rocks; especially in lavas, the pores of which they may fill with
calcareous spar, so as to convert them into amygdaloids. Some geologists,
therefore, are unreasonable when they expect that volcanic rocks
of remote eras should accord precisely with those of modern date;
since it is obvious that many of those produced in our own time will
not long retain the same aspect and internal composition.</p>

<p>Both at Herculaneum and Pompeii, temples have been found with
inscriptions commemorating the rebuilding of the edifices after they had
been thrown down by an earthquake.<a name="FNanchor_555" id="FNanchor_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a> This earthquake happened in
the reign of Nero, sixteen years before the cities were overwhelmed. In
Pompeii, one-fourth of which is now laid open to the day, both the
public and private buildings bear testimony to the catastrophe. The
walls are rent, and in many places traversed by fissures still open.
Columns are lying on the ground only half hewn from huge blocks of
travertin, and the temple for which they were designed is seen half
repaired. In some few places the pavement had sunk in, but in general
it was undisturbed, consisting of large irregular flags of lava joined
neatly together, in which the carriage wheels have often worn ruts an
inch and a half deep. In the wider streets, the ruts are numerous and
irregular; in the narrower, there are only two, one on each side, which
are very conspicuous. It is impossible not to look with some interest
even on these ruts, which were worn by chariot wheels more than
seventeen centuries ago; and, independently of their antiquity, it is
remarkable to see such deep incisions so continuous in a stone of great
hardness.</p>

<p><i>Small number of skeletons.</i>&mdash;A very small number of skeletons have
been discovered in either city; and it is clear that most of the inhabitants
not only found time to escape, but also to carry with them the
principal part of their valuable effects. In the barracks at Pompeii
were the skeletons of two soldiers chained to the stocks, and in the
vaults of a country-house in the suburbs were the skeletons of seventeen
persons, who appear to have fled there to escape from the shower
of ashes. They were found inclosed in an indurated tuff, and in this
matrix was preserved a perfect cast of a woman, perhaps the mistress
of the house, with an infant in her arms. Although her form was imprinted
on the rock, nothing but the bones remained. To these a chain
of gold was suspended, and on the fingers of the skeletons were rings
with jewels. Against the sides of the same vault was ranged a long
line of earthen amphor&aelig;.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
The writings scribbled by the soldiers on the walls of their barracks,
and the names of the owners of each house written over the doors, are
still perfectly legible. The colors of fresco paintings on the stuccoed
walls in the interior of buildings are almost as vivid as if they were just
finished. There are public fountains decorated with shells laid out in
patterns in the same fashion as those now seen in the town of Naples;
and in the room of a painter, who was perhaps a naturalist, a large collection
of shells was found, comprising a great variety of Mediterranean
species, in as good a state of preservation as if they had remained for
the same number of years in a museum. A comparison of these
remains, with those found so generally in a fossil state would not assist
us in obtaining the least insight into the time required to produce a certain
degree of decomposition or mineralization; for, although under
favorable circumstances much greater alteration might doubtless have
been brought about in a shorter period, yet the example before us shows
that an inhumation of seventeen centuries may sometimes effect nothing
towards the reduction of shells to the state in which fossils are usually
found.</p>

<p>The wooden beams in the houses at Herculaneum are black on the
exterior, but, when cleft open, they appear to be almost in the state of
ordinary wood, and the progress made by the whole mass towards the
state of lignite is scarcely appreciable. Some animal and vegetable
substances of more perishable kinds have of course suffered much
change and decay, yet the state of preservation of these is truly remarkable.
Fishing-nets are very abundant in both cities, often quite
entire; and their number at Pompeii is the more interesting from the
sea being now, as we stated, a mile distant. Linen has been found at
Herculaneum, with the texture well defined; and in a fruiterer's shop
in that city were discovered vessels full of almonds, chestnuts, walnuts,
and fruit of the "carubiere," all distinctly recognizable from their
shape. A loaf, also, still retaining its form, was found in a baker's
shop, with his name stamped upon it. On the counter of an apothecary
was a box of pills converted into a fine earthy substance; and by
the side of it a small cylindrical roll evidently prepared to be cut into
pills. By the side of these was a jar containing medicinal herbs. In
1827, moist olives were found in a square glass-case, and "caviare," or
roe of a fish, in a state of wonderful preservation. An examination of
these curious condiments has been published by Covelli of Naples, and
they are preserved hermetically sealed in the museum there.<a name="FNanchor_556" id="FNanchor_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a></p>

<p><i>Papyri.</i>&mdash;There is a marked difference in the condition and appearance
of the animal and vegetable substances found at Pompeii and
Herculaneum; those of Pompeii being penetrated by a gray pulverulent
tuff, those in Herculaneum seeming to have been first enveloped
by a paste which consolidated round them, and then allowed them to
become slowly carbonized. Some of the rolls of papyrus at Pompeii
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
still retain their form; but the writing, and indeed almost all the vegetable
matter, appear to have vanished, and to have been replaced by
volcanic tuff somewhat pulverulent. At Herculaneum the earthy matter
has scarcely ever penetrated; and the vegetable substance of the
papyrus has become a thin friable black matter, almost resembling in
appearance the tinder which remains when stiff paper has been burnt,
in which the letters may still be sometimes traced. The small bundles
of papyri, composed of five or six rolls tied up together, had sometimes
lain horizontally, and were pressed in that direction, but sometimes
they had been placed in a vertical position. Small tickets were attached
to each bundle, on which the title of the work was inscribed.
In one case only have the sheets been found with writing on both sides
of the pages. So numerous are the obliterations and corrections, that
many must have been original manuscripts. The variety of handwritings
is quite extraordinary: nearly all are written in Greek, but there
are a few in Latin. They were almost all found in a suburban villa in
the library of one private individual; and the titles of four hundred of
those least injured, which have been read, are found to be unimportant
works, but all entirely new, chiefly relating to music, rhetoric, and
cookery. There are two volumes of Epicurus "On Nature," and the
others are mostly by writers of the same school, only one fragment
having been discovered, by an opponent of the Epicurean system,
Chrysippus.<a name="FNanchor_557" id="FNanchor_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a></p>

<p><i>Probability of future discoveries of MSS.</i>&mdash;In the opinion of some
antiquaries, not one-hundredth part of the city has yet been explored:
and the quarters hitherto cleared out at a great expense, are those
where there was the least probability of discovering manuscripts. As
Italy could already boast her splendid Roman amphitheatres and Greek
temples, it was a matter of secondary interest to add to their number
those in the dark and dripping galleries of Herculaneum; and having
so many of the masterpieces of ancient art, we could have dispensed
with the inferior busts and statues which could alone have been expected
to reward our researches in the ruins of a provincial town.
But from the moment that it was ascertained that rolls of papyrus preserved
in this city could still be deciphered, every exertion ought to
have been steadily and exclusively directed towards the discovery of
other libraries. Private dwellings should have been searched, before
so much labor and expense were consumed in examining public edifices.
A small portion of that zeal and enlightened spirit which
prompted the late French and Tuscan expedition to Egypt might long
ere this, in a country nearer home, have snatched from oblivion some
of the lost works of the Augustan age, or of eminent Greek historians
and philosophers. A single roll of papyrus might have disclosed more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
matter of intense interest than all that was ever written in hieroglyphics.</p>

<p><i>Stabi&aelig;.</i>&mdash;Besides the cities already mentioned, Stabi&aelig;, a small town
about six miles from Vesuvius, and near the site of the modern Castel-a-Mare
(see <a href="#f40">map</a> of volcanic district of Naples), was overwhelmed during
the eruption of 79. Pliny mentions that, when his uncle was there, he
was obliged to make his escape, so great was the quantity of falling
stones and ashes. In the ruins of this place, a few skeletons have been
found buried in volcanic ejections, together with some antiquities of no
great value, and rolls of papyrus, which, like those of Pompeii, were
illegible.</p>

<p><i>Torre del Greco overflowed by lava.</i>&mdash;Of the towns hitherto mentioned,
Herculaneum alone has been overflowed by a stream of melted
matter; but this did not, as we have seen, enter or injure the buildings,
which were previously enveloped or covered over with tuff. But burning
torrents have often taken their course through the streets of Torre
del Greco, and consumed or inclosed a large portion of the town in
solid rock. It seems probable that the destruction of three thousand
of its inhabitants in 1631, which some accounts attribute to boiling water,
was principally due to one of those alluvial floods which we before
mentioned: but, in 1737, the lava itself flowed through the eastern
side of the town, and afterwards reached the sea; and, in 1794, another
current, rolling over the western side, filled the streets and houses, and
killed more than four hundred persons. The main street is now quarried
through this lava, which supplied building stones for new houses erected
where others had been annihilated. The church was half buried in a
rocky mass, but the upper portion served as the foundation of a new
edifice.</p>

<p>The number of the population at present is estimated at fifteen thousand;
and a satisfactory answer may readily be returned to those who
inquire how the inhabitants can be so "inattentive to the voice of time
and the warnings of nature,"<a name="FNanchor_558" id="FNanchor_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a> as to rebuild their dwellings on a spot so
often devastated. No neighboring site unoccupied by a town, or which
would not be equally insecure, combines the same advantages of proximity
to the capital, to the sea, and to the rich lands on the flanks of
Vesuvius. If the present population were exiled, they would immediately
be replaced by another, for the same reason that the Maremma
of Tuscany and the Campagna di Roma will never be depopulated,
although the malaria fever commits more havoc in a few years than the
Vesuvian lavas in as many centuries. The district around Naples supplies
one amongst innumerable examples, that those regions where the
surface is most frequently renewed, and where the renovation is accompanied,
at different intervals of time, by partial destruction of animal
and vegetable life, may nevertheless be amongst the most habitable and
delightful on our globe.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
I have already made a similar remark when speaking of tracts where
aqueous causes are now most active; and the observation applies as
well to parts of the surface which are the abode of aquatic animals, as
to those which support terrestrial species. The sloping sides of Vesuvius
give nourishment to a vigorous and healthy population of about
eighty thousand souls; and the surrounding hills and plains, together
with several of the adjoining isles, owe the fertility of their soil to matter
ejected by prior eruptions. Had the fundamental limestone of the
Apennines remained uncovered throughout the whole area, the country
could not have sustained a twentieth part of its present inhabitants. This
will be apparent to every geologist who has marked the change in the
agricultural character of the soil the moment he has passed the utmost
boundary of the volcanic ejections, as when, for example, at the distance
of about seven miles from Vesuvius, he leaves the plain and
ascends the declivity of the Sorrentine Hills.</p>

<p>Yet, favored as this region has been by Nature from time immemorial,
the signs of the changes imprinted on it during the period that it has
served as the habitation of man may appear in after-ages to indicate
a series of unparalleled disasters. Let us suppose that at some future
time the Mediterranean should form a gulf of the great ocean, and that
the waves and tidal current should encroach on the shores of Campania,
as it now advances upon the eastern coast of England; the geologist will
then behold the towns already buried, and many more which will evidently
be entombed hereafter, laid open in the steep cliffs, where he
will discover buildings superimposed above each other, with thick intervening
strata of tuff or lava&mdash;some unscathed by fire, like those of
Herculaneum and Pompeii; others half melted down, as in Torre del
Greco; and many shattered and thrown about in strange confusion, as
in Tripergola, beneath Monte Nuovo. Among the ruins will be seen
skeletons of men, and impressions of the human form stamped in solid
rocks of tuff. Nor will the signs of earthquakes be wanting. The pavement
of part of the Domitian Way, and the temple of the Nymphs, submerged
at high tide, will be uncovered at low water, the columns remaining
erect and uninjured. Other temples which had once sunk down,
like that of Serapis, will be found to have been upraised again by subsequent
movements. If they who study these phenomena, and speculate
on their causes, assume that there were periods when the laws of
Nature or the whole course of natural events differed greatly from those
observed in their own time, they will scarcely hesitate to refer the wonderful
monuments in question to those primeval ages. When they consider
the numerous proofs of reiterated catastrophes to which the region
was subject, they may, perhaps, commiserate the unhappy fate of beings
condemned to inhabit a planet during its nascent and chaotic state, and
feel grateful that their favored race has escaped such scenes of anarchy
and misrule.</p>

<p>Yet what was the real condition of Campania during those years of
dire convulsion? "A climate where heaven's breath smells sweet and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span>
wooingly&mdash;a vigorous and luxuriant nature unparalleled in its productions&mdash;a
coast which was once the fairy-land of poets, and the favorite
retreat of great men. Even the tyrants of the creation loved this alluring
region, spared it, adorned it, lived in it, died in it."<a name="FNanchor_559" id="FNanchor_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> The inhabitants,
indeed, have enjoyed no immunity from the calamities which are
the lot of mankind; but the principal evils which they have suffered
must be attributed to moral, not to physical, causes&mdash;to disastrous
events over which man might have exercised a control, rather than to
the inevitable catastrophes which result from subterranean agency.
When Spartacus encamped his army of ten thousand gladiators in the
old extinct crater of Vesuvius, the volcano was more justly a subject of
terror to Campania, than it has ever been since the rekindling of its fires.</p>

<p><i>External physiognomy of Etna.</i>&mdash;After Vesuvius, our most authentic
records relate to Etna, which rises near the sea in solitary grandeur to
the height of nearly eleven thousand feet.<a name="FNanchor_560" id="FNanchor_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a> The base of the cone is
almost circular, and eighty-seven English miles in circumference; but
if we include the whole district over which its lavas extend, the circuit
is probably twice that extent.</p>

<p><i>Divided into three regions.</i>&mdash;The cone is divided by nature into three
distinct zones, called the <i>fertile</i>, the <i>woody</i>, and the <i>desert</i> regions. The
first of these, comprising the delightful country around the skirts of the
mountain, is well cultivated, thickly inhabited, and covered with olives,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
vines, corn, fruit-trees, and aromatic herbs. Higher up, the woody
region encircles the mountain&mdash;an extensive forest six or seven miles in
width, affording pasturage for numerous flocks. The trees are of various
species, the chestnut, oak, and pine being most luxuriant; while in some
tracts are groves of cork and beech. Above the forest is the desert
region, a waste of black lava and scori&aelig;; where, on a kind of plain,
rises a cone of eruption to the height of about eleven hundred feet, from
which sulphureous vapors are continually evolved.</p>

<p><i>Cones produced by lateral eruption.</i>&mdash;The most grand and original
feature in the physiognomy of Etna is the multitude of minor cones
which are distributed over its flanks, and which are most abundant in
the woody region. These, although they appear but trifling irregularities
when viewed from a distance as subordinate parts of so imposing
and colossal a mountain, would, nevertheless, be deemed hills of considerable
altitude in almost any other region. Without enumerating numerous
monticules of ashes thrown out at different points, there are
about eighty of these secondary volcanoes, of considerable dimensions;
fifty-two on the west and north, and twenty-seven on the east side of
Etna. One of the largest, called Monte Minardo, near Bronte, is upwards
of 700 feet in height, and a double hill near Nicolosi, called
Monti Rossi, formed in 1669, is 450 feet high, and the base two miles in
circumference; so that it somewhat exceeds in size Monte Nuovo, before
described. Yet it ranks only as a cone of the second magnitude
amongst those produced by the lateral eruptions of Etna. On looking
down from the lower borders of the desert region, these volcanoes present
us with one of the most delightful and characteristic scenes in
Europe. They afford every variety of height and size, and are arranged
in beautiful and picturesque groups. However uniform they may appear
when seen from the sea, or the plains below, nothing can be more
diversified than their shape when we look from above into their craters,
one side of which is generally broken down. There are, indeed, few
objects in nature more picturesque than a wooded volcanic crater. The
cones situated in the higher parts of the forest zone are chiefly clothed
with lofty pines; while those at a lower elevation are adorned with
chestnuts, oaks, beech, and holm.</p>

<p><i>Successive obliteration of these cones.</i>&mdash;The history of the eruptions of
Etna, imperfect and interrupted as it is, affords us, nevertheless, much
insight into the manner in which the whole mountain has successively attained
its present magnitude and internal structure. The principal cone
has more than once fallen in and been reproduced. In 1444 it was 320
feet high, and fell in after the earthquakes of 1537. In the year 1693,
when a violent earthquake shook the whole of Sicily, and killed sixty
thousand persons, the cone lost so much of its height, says Boccone,
that it could not be seen from several places in Valdemone, from which
it was before visible. The greater number of eruptions happen either
from the great crater, or from lateral openings in the desert region.
When hills are thrown up in the middle zone, and project beyond the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
general level, they gradually lose their height during subsequent eruptions;
for when lava runs down from the upper parts of the mountain,
and encounters any of these hills, the stream is divided, and flows round
them so as to elevate the gently sloping grounds from which they rise.
In this manner a deduction is often made at once of twenty or thirty
feet, or even more, from their height. Thus, one of the minor cones,
called Monte Peluso, was diminished in altitude by a great lava stream
which encircled it in 1444; and another current has recently taken the
same course&mdash;yet this hill still remains four or five hundred feet high.</p>

<p>There is a cone called Monte Nucilla near Nicolosi, round the base of
which several successive currents have flowed, and showers of ashes
have fallen, since the time of history, till at last, during an eruption in
1536, the surrounding plain was so raised, that the top of the cone
alone was left projecting above the general level. Monte Nero, situated
above the Grotta dell' Capre, was in 1766 almost submerged by a current:
and Monte Capreolo afforded, in the year 1669, a curious example
of one of the last stages of obliteration; for a lava stream, descending on
a high ridge which had been built up by the continued superposition
of successive lavas, flowed directly into the crater, and nearly filled it.
The lava, therefore, of each new lateral cone tends to detract from the
relative height of lower cones above their base: so that the flanks of
Etna, sloping with a gentle inclination, envelop in succession a great
multitude of minor volcanoes, while new ones spring up from time to
time.</p>

<p><i>Early eruptions of Etna.</i>&mdash;Etna appears to have been in activity
from the earliest times of tradition; for Diodorus Siculus mentions an
eruption which caused a district to be deserted by the Sicani before the
Trojan war. Thucydides informs us, that in the sixth year of the Peloponnesian
war, or in the spring of the year 425 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, a lava stream
ravaged the environs of Catania, and this he says was the third eruption
which had happened in Sicily since the colonization of that island by
the Greeks.<a name="FNanchor_561" id="FNanchor_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a> The second of the three eruptions alluded to by the historian
took place in the year 475 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, and was that so poetically
described by Pindar, two years afterwards, in his first Pythian ode:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">&#916;' &#959;&#965;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#953;&#945; &#963;&#965;&#957;&#949;&#967;&#949;&#953;</span>

</div>
</div>

<p>In these and the seven verses which follow, a graphic description is
given of Etna, such as it appeared five centuries before the Christian
era, and such as it has been seen when in eruption in modern times. The
poet is only making a passing allusion to the Sicilian volcano, as the
mountain under which Typh&oelig;us lay buried, yet by a few touches of his
master-hand every striking feature of the scene has been faithfully portrayed.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
We are told of "the snowy Etna, the pillar of heaven&mdash;the
nurse of everlasting frost, in whose deep caverns lie concealed the fountains
of unapproachable fire&mdash;a stream of eddying smoke by day&mdash;a
bright and ruddy flame by night; and burning rocks rolled down with
loud uproar into the sea."</p>

<p><i>Eruption of 1669&mdash;Monti Rossi formed.</i>&mdash;The great eruption which
happened in the year 1669 is the first which claims particular attention.
An earthquake had levelled to the ground all the houses in Nicolosi, a
town situated near the lower margin of the woody region, about twenty
miles from the summit of Etna, and ten from the sea at Catania. Two
gulfs then opened near that town, from whence sand and scori&aelig; were
thrown up in such quantity, that in the course of three or four months
a double cone was formed, called Monti Rossi, about 450 feet high. But
the most extraordinary phenomenon occurred at the commencement of
the convulsion in the plain of S. Lio. A fissure six feet broad, and of
unknown depth, opened with a loud crash, and ran in a somewhat tortuous
course to within a mile of the summit of Etna. Its direction was
from north to south, and its length twelve miles. It emitted a most
vivid light. Five other parallel fissures of considerable length afterwards
opened, one after the other, and emitted smoke, and gave out bellowing
sounds which were heard at the distance of forty miles. This
case seems to present the geologist with an illustration of the manner in
which those continuous dikes of vertical porphyry were formed, which
are seen to traverse some of the older lavas of Etna; for the light emitted
from the great rent of S. Lio appears to indicate that the fissure was
filled to a certain height with incandescent lava, probably to the height
of an orifice not far distant from Monti Rossi, which at that time opened
and poured out a lava current. When the melted matter in such a rent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">400</a></span>
has cooled, it must become a solid wall or dike, intersecting the older
rocks of which the mountain is composed; similar rents have been
observed during subsequent eruptions, as in 1832, when they ran in all
directions from the centre of the volcano. It has been justly remarked
by M. Elie de Beaumont, that such star-shaped fractures may indicate
a slight upheaval of the whole of Etna. They may be the signs of the
stretching of the mass, which may thus be raised gradually by a force
from below.<a name="FNanchor_563" id="FNanchor_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a></p>

<p>The lava current of 1669, before alluded to, soon reached in its course
a minor cone called Mompiliere, at the base of which it entered a subterranean
grotto, communicating with a suite of those caverns which are
so common in the lavas of Etna. Here it appears to have melted down
some of the vaulted foundations of the hill, so that the whole of that
cone became slightly depressed and traversed by numerous open fissures.</p>

<p><i>Part of Catania destroyed.</i>&mdash;The lava, after overflowing fourteen
towns and villages, some having a population of between three and four
thousand inhabitants, arrived at length at the walls of Catania. These
had been purposely raised to protect the city; but the burning flood
accumulated till it rose to the top of the rampart, which was sixty feet
in height, and then it fell in a fiery cascade and overwhelmed part of the
city. The wall, however, was not thrown down, but was discovered
long afterwards by excavations made in the rock by the Prince of Biscari;
so that the traveller may now see the solid lava curling over the
top of the rampart as if still in the very act of falling.</p>

<p>This great current performed the first thirteen miles of its course in
twenty days, or at the rate of 162 feet per hour, but required twenty-three
days for the last two miles, giving a velocity of only twenty-two
feet per hour; and we learn from Dolomieu that the stream moved
during part of its course at the rate of 1500 feet an hour, and in others
it took several days to cover a few yards.<a name="FNanchor_564" id="FNanchor_564"></a><a href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a> When it entered the sea it
was still six hundred yards broad, and forty feet deep. It covered some
territories in the environs of Catania which had never before been visited
by the lavas of Etna. While moving on, its surface was in general a
mass of solid rock; and its mode of advancing, as is usual with lava
streams, was by the occasional fissuring of the solid walls. A gentleman
of Catania, named Pappalardo, desiring to secure the city from the
approach of the threatening torrent, went out with a party of fifty men
whom he had dressed in skins to protect them from the heat, and armed
with iron crows and hooks. They broke open one of the solid walls
which flanked the current near Belpasso, and immediately forth issued
a rivulet of melted matter which took the direction of Patern&oacute;; but the
inhabitants of that town, being alarmed for their safety, took up arms
and put a stop to farther operations.<a name="FNanchor_565" id="FNanchor_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
As another illustration of the solidity of the walls of an advancing
lava stream, I may mention an adventure related by Recupero, who, in
1766, had ascended a small hill formed of ancient volcanic matter, to
behold the slow and gradual approach of a fiery current, two miles and
a half broad; when suddenly two small threads of liquid matter issuing
from a crevice detached themselves from the main stream, and ran rapidly
towards the hill. He and his guide had just time to escape, when
they saw the hill, which was fifty feet in height, surrounded, and in a
quarter of an hour melted down into the burning mass, so as to flow on
with it.</p>

<p>But it must not be supposed that this complete fusion of rocky matter
coming in contact with lava is of universal, or even common, occurrence.
It probably happens when fresh portions of incandescent matter come
successively in contact with fusible materials. In many of the dikes
which intersect the tuffs and lavas of Etna, there is scarcely any perceptible
alteration effected by heat on the edges of the horizontal beds, in
contact with the vertical and more crystalline mass. On the side of
Mompiliere, one of the towns overflowed in the great eruption above
described, an excavation was made in 1704; and by immense labor the
workmen reached, at the depth of thirty-five feet, the gate of the principal
church, where there were three statues, held in high veneration.
One of these, together with a bell, some money, and other articles, were
extracted in a good state of preservation from beneath a great arch
formed by the lava. It seems very extraordinary that any works of art,
not encased with tuff, like those in Herculaneum, should have escaped
fusion in hollow spaces left open in this lava-current, which was so hot
at Catania eight years after it entered the town, that it was impossible
to hold the hand in some of the crevices.</p>

<p><i>Subterranean caverns on Etna.</i>&mdash;Mention was made of the entrance
of a lava-stream into a subterranean grotto, whereby the foundations of
a hill were partially undermined. Such underground passages are among
the most curious features on Etna, and appear to have been produced by
the hardening of the lava, during the escape of great volumes of elastic
fluids, which are often discharged for many days in succession, after the
crisis of the eruption is over. Near Nicolosi, not far from Monti Rossi,
one of these great openings may be seen, called the Fossa della Palomba,
625 feet in circumference at its mouth, and seventy-eight deep.
After reaching the bottom of this, we enter another dark cavity, and
then others in succession, sometimes descending precipices by means of
ladders. At length the vaults terminate in a great gallery ninety feet
long, and from fifteen to fifty broad, beyond which there is still a passage,
never yet explored; so that the extent of these caverns remains
unknown.<a name="FNanchor_566" id="FNanchor_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a> The walls and roofs of these great vaults are composed of
rough and bristling scori&aelig;, of the most fantastic forms.</p>

<p><i>Marine strata at base of Etna.</i>&mdash;If we skirt the fertile region at the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
base of Etna on its southern and eastern sides, we behold marine strata
of clay sand, and volcanic tuff, cropping out from beneath the modern
lavas. The marine fossil shells occurring in these strata are all of them,
or nearly all, identical with species now inhabiting the Mediterranean;
and as they appear at the height of from 600 to 800 feet above the sea
near Catania, they clearly prove that there has been in this region, as in
other parts of Sicily farther to the south, an upward movement of the
ancient bed of the sea. It is fair, therefore, to infer that the whole
mountain, with the exception of those parts which are of very modern
origin, has participated in this upheaval.</p>

<p>If we view Etna from the south, we see the marine deposits above
alluded to, forming a low line of hills (<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>, Fig. 47), or a steep inland
slope or cliff (<i>f</i>), as in the annexed drawing taken from the limestone
platform of Primosole. It should be observed however, in reference to
this view, that the height of the volcanic cone is ten times greater than
the hills at its base (<i>e</i>, <i>e</i>), although it appears less elevated, because the
summit of the cone is ten or twelve times more distant from the plain of
Catania than is Licodia.</p>

<p>The mountain is in general of a very symmetrical form, a flattened
cone broken on its eastern side, by a deep valley, called the Val del
Bove, or in the provincial dialect of the peasants, "Val di Bu&eacute;," for here
the herdsman</p>

</div>
</div>

<p>Dr. Buckland was, I believe, the first English geologist who examined
this valley with attention, and I am indebted to him for having described
it to me, before I visited Sicily, as more worthy of attention than any
single spot in that island, or perhaps in Europe.</p>

<p>The Val del Bove commences near the summit of Etna, and descending
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>
into the woody region, is farther continued on one side by a second
and narrower valley, called the Val di Calanna. Below this another,
named the Val di St. Giacomo, begins,&mdash;a long narrow ravine, which
is prolonged to the neighborhood of Zaffarana (<i>e</i>, <a href="#f48">fig. 48</a>), on the confines
of the fertile region. These natural incisions into the side of the volcano
are of such depth that they expose to view a great part of the structure
of the entire mass, which, in the Val del Bove, is laid open to the
depth of from 3000 to above 4000 feet from the summit of Etna. The
geologist thus enjoys an opportunity of ascertaining how far the internal
conformation of the cone corresponds with what he might have anticipated
as the result of that mode of increase which has been witnessed
during the historical era.</p>

<p><i>Description of Plate III.</i>&mdash;The accompanying view (Pl. III.) is part
of a panoramic sketch which I made in November, 1828, and may assist
the reader in comprehending some topographical details to be alluded
to in the sequel, although it can convey no idea of the picturesque
grandeur of the scene.</p>

<p>The great lava-currents of 1819 and 1811 are seen pouring down
from the higher parts of the valley, overrunning the forests of the great
plain, and rising up in the foreground on the left with a rugged surface,
on which many hillocks and depressions appear, such as often characterize
a lava-current immediately after its consolidation.</p>

<p>The small cone, No. 7, was formed in 1811, and was still smoking
when I saw it in 1828. The other small volcano to the left, from which
vapor is issuing, was, I believe, one of those formed in 1819.</p>

unable to point out the precise spot which this crater would occupy in
the view represented in Plate III.; but I conceive that it would appear
in the face of the great precipice, near which the smoke issuing from
the cone No. 7 is made to terminate. There are many ledges of rock
on the face of that precipice where eruptions have occurred.</p>

<p>The Val del Bove is of truly magnificent dimensions, a vast amphitheatre
four or five miles in diameter, surrounded by nearly vertical
precipices, varying from 1000 to above 3000 feet in height, the loftiest
being at the upper end, and the height gradually diminishing on both
sides. The feature which first strikes the geologist as distinguishing
the boundary cliffs of this valley, is the prodigious multitude of verticle
dikes which are seen in all directions traversing the volcanic beds. The
circular form of this great chasm, and the occurrence of these countless
dikes, amounting perhaps to several thousands in number, so forcibly
recalled to my mind the phenomena of the Atrio del Cavallo, on Vesuvius,
that I at first imagined that I had entered a vast crater, on a scale as
far exceeding that of Somma, as Etna surpasses Vesuvius in magnitude.</p>

<p>But I was soon undeceived when I had attentively explored the different
sides of the great amphitheatre, in order to satisfy myself whether
the semicircular wall of the Val del Bove had ever formed the boundary
of a crater, and whether the beds had the same qu&acirc;qu&acirc;-versal dip
which is so beautifully exhibited in the escarpment of Somma. Had
the supposed analogy between Somma and the Val del Bove held true,
the tufts and lavas at the head of the valley would have dipped to the
west, those on the north side towards the north, and those on the
southern side to the south. But such I did not find to be the inclination
of the beds; they all dip towards the sea, or nearly east, as in the
valleys of St. Giacomo and Calanna below.</p>

<i>Scenery of the Val del Bove.</i>&mdash;Let the reader picture to himself a
large amphitheatre, five miles in diameter, and surrounded on three sides
by precipices from 2000 to 3000 feet in height. If he has beheld that
most picturesque scene in the chain of the Pyrenees, the celebrated
"cirque of Gavarnie," he may form some conception of the magnificent
circle of precipitous rocks which inclose, on three sides, the great plain
of the Val del Bove. This plain has been deluged by repeated streams
of lava; and although it appears almost level, when viewed from a distance,
it is, in fact, more uneven than the surface of the most tempestuous
sea. Besides the minor irregularities of the lava, the valley is in one
part interrupted by a ridge of rocks, two of which, Musara and Capra,
are very prominent. It can hardly be said that they</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;&mdash;"like giants stand</span>
<span class="i0">To sentinel enchanted land;"</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>for although, like the Trosachs, in the Highlands of Scotland, they are of
gigantic dimensions, and appear almost isolated, as seen from many points,
yet the stern and severe grandeur of the scenery which they adorn is
not such as would be selected by a poet for a vale of enchantment. The
character of the scene would accord far better with Milton's picture of
the infernal world; and if we imagine ourselves to behold in motion, in
the darkness of the night, one of those fiery currents which have so often
traversed the great valley, we may well recall</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;&mdash;"yon dreary plain, forlorn and wild,</span>
<span class="i0">The seat of desolation, void of light,</span>
<span class="i0">Save what the glimmering of these livid flames</span>
<span class="i0">Casts pale and dreadful."</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>The face of the precipices already mentioned is broken in the most
picturesque manner by the vertical walls of lava which traverse them.
These masses visually stand out in relief, are exceedingly diversified in
form, and of immense altitude. In the autumn, their black outline may
often be seen relieved by clouds of fleecy vapor which settle behind
them, and do not disperse until mid-day, continuing to fill the valley
while the sun is shining on every other part of Sicily, and on the higher
regions of Etna.</p>

<p>As soon as the vapors begin to rise, the changes of scene are varied
in the highest degree, different rocks being unveiled and hidden by turns,
and the summit of Etna often breaking through the clouds for a moment
with its dazzling snows, and being then as suddenly withdrawn from
the view.</p>

<p>An unusual silence prevails; for there are no torrents dashing from
the rocks, nor any movement of running water in this valley such as may
almost invariably be heard in mountainous regions. Every drop of water
that falls from the heavens, or flows from the melting ice and snow, is
instantly absorbed by the porous lava; and such is the dearth of springs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span>
that the herdsman is compelled to supply his flocks, during the hot season,
from stores of snow laid up in hollows of the mountain during winter.</p>

<p>The strips of green herbage and forest land, which have here and there
escaped the burning lavas, serve, by contrast, to heighten the desolation
of the scene. When I visited the valley, nine years after the eruption of
1819, I saw hundreds of trees, or rather the white skeletons of trees, on
the borders of the black lava, the trunks and branches being all leafless,
and deprived of their bark by the scorching heat emitted from the melted
rock; an image recalling those beautiful lines:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center2">Dikes at the base of the Serre del Solfizio, Etna.</p></div>

<p><i>Form, composition, and origin of the dikes.</i>&mdash;But without indulging
the imagination any longer in descriptions of scenery, I may observe that
the dikes before mentioned form unquestionably the most interesting
geological phenomenon in the Val del Bove. Some of these are composed
of trachyte, others of compact blue basalt with olivine. They vary in
breadth from two to twenty feet and upwards, and usually project from
the face of the cliffs, as represented in the annexed drawing (<a href="#f49">fig. 49</a>).
They consist of harder materials than the strata which they traverse, and
therefore waste away less rapidly under the influence of that repeated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span>
congelation and thawing to which the rocks in this zone of Etna are exposed.
The dikes are for the most part vertical, but sometimes they
run in a tortuous course through the tuffs and breccias, as represented
in <a href="#f50">fig. 50</a>. In the escarpment of Somma, where similar walls of lava cut
through alternating beds of sand and scori&aelig;, a coating of coal-black rock,
approaching in its nature and appearance to pitchstone, is seen at the
contact of the dike with the intersected beds. I did not observe such
parting layers at the junction of the Etnean dikes which I examined, but
they may perhaps be discoverable.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 50.</span><a name="f50" id="f50"></a><img src="images/f50.png" width="500" height="282" alt="Tortuous veins of lava at Punto di Giumento, Etna." title="" />

<p class="center2">Tortuous veins of lava at Punto di Giumento, Etna.</p></div>

<p>The geographical position of these dikes is most interesting, as they
are very numerous near the head of the Val del Bove, where the cones
of 1811 and 1819 were thrown up, as also in that zone of the mountain
where lateral eruptions are frequent; whereas in the valley of Calanna,
which is below that parallel, and in a region where lateral eruptions are
extremely rare, scarcely any dikes are seen, and none whatever still lower
in the valley of St. Giacomo. This is precisely what we might have
expected, if we consider the vertical fissures now filled with rock to have
been the feeders of lateral cones, or, in other words, the channels which
gave passage to the lava-currents and scori&aelig; that have issued from vents
in the forest zone. In other parts of Etna there may be numerous dikes
at as low a level as the Valley of Calanna, because the line of lateral
eruptions is not everywhere at the same height above the sea; but in
the section above alluded to, there appeared to me an obvious connection
between the frequency of dikes and of lateral eruptions.</p>

<p>Some fissures may have been filled from above, but I did not see any
which, by terminating downwards, gave proof of such an origin. Almost
all the isolated masses in the Val del Bove, such as Capra, Musara, and
others, are traversed by dikes, and may, perhaps, have partly owed their
preservation to that circumstance, if at least the action of occasional
floods has been one of the destroying causes in the Val del Bove; for
there is nothing which affords so much protection to a mass of strata
against the undermining action of running water as a perpendicular dike
of hard rock.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
In the accompanying drawing (<a href="#f51">fig. 51</a>), the flowing of the lavas of
1811 and 1819, between the rocks Finochio, Capra, and Musara, is represented.
The height of the two last-mentioned isolated masses has
been much diminished by the elevation of their base, caused by these
currents. They may, perhaps, be the remnants of lateral cones which
existed before the Val del Bove was formed, and may hereafter be once
more buried by the lavas that are now accumulating in the valley.</p>

<p>From no point of view are the dikes more conspicuous than from the
summit of the highest cone of Etna; a view of some of them is given in
the annexed drawing. (Fig. 52.)</p>

<p><i>Eruption of 1811.</i>&mdash;I have alluded to the streams of lava which were
poured forth in 1811 and 1819. Gemmellaro, who witnessed these
eruptions, informs us that the great crater in 1811 first testified by its
loud detonations that a column of lava had ascended to near the summit
of the mountain. A violent shock was then felt, and a stream broke out
from the side of the cone, at no great distance from its apex. Shortly
after this had ceased to flow, a second stream burst forth at another
opening, considerably below the first; then a third still lower, and so on
till seven different issues had been thus successively formed, all lying
upon the same straight line. It has been supposed that this line was a
perpendicular rent in the internal framework of the mountain, which rent
was probably not produced at one shock, but prolonged successively
downwards, by the lateral pressure and intense heat of the internal column
of lava, as it subsided by gradual discharge through each vent.<a name="FNanchor_568" id="FNanchor_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor">568</a></p>

<p><i>Eruption of 1819.</i>&mdash;In 1819 three large mouths or caverns opened
very near those which were formed in the eruptions of 1811, from which
flames, red-hot cinders, and sand were thrown up with loud explosions.
A few minutes afterwards another mouth opened below, from which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
flames and smoke issued; and finally a fifth, lower still, whence a torrent
of lava flowed, which spread itself with great velocity over the
deep and broad valley called "Val del Bove." This stream flowed two
miles in the first twenty-four hours, and nearly as far in the succeeding
day and night. The three original mouths at length united into one
large crater, and sent forth lava, as did the inferior apertures, so that an
enormous torrent poured down the "Val del Bove." When it arrived
at a vast and almost perpendicular precipice, at the head of the Valley
of Calanna, it poured over in a cascade, and, being hardened in its descent,
made an inconceivable crash as it was dashed against the bottom.
So immense was the column of dust raised by the abrasion of the tufaceous
hill over which the hardened mass descended, that the Catanians
were in great alarm, supposing a new eruption to have burst out in the
woody region, exceeding in violence that near the summit of Etna.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 52.</span><a name="f52" id="f52"></a><img src="images/f52.jpg" width="550" height="466" alt="View from the summit of Etna into the Val del Bove." title="" />

<p><i>Mode of advance of the lava.</i>&mdash;Of the cones thrown up during this
eruption, not more than two are of sufficient magnitude to be numbered
among those eighty which were before described as adorning the
flanks of Etna. The surface of the lava which deluged the "Val del
Bove," consists of rocky and <i>angular blocks</i>, tossed together in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>
utmost disorder. Nothing can be more rugged, or more unlike the
smooth and even superficies, which those who are unacquainted with
volcanic countries may have pictured to themselves, in a mass of matter
which had consolidated from a liquid state. Mr. Scrope observed
this current in the year 1819, slowly advancing down a considerable
slope, at the rate of about a yard an hour, nine months after its emission.
The lower stratum being arrested by the resistance of the ground,
the upper or central part gradually protruded itself, and, being unsupported,
fell down. This in its turn was covered by a mass of more
liquid lava, which swelled over it from above. The current had all the
appearance of a huge heap of rough and large cinders rolling over and
over upon itself by the effect of an extremely slow propulsion from
behind. The contraction of the crust as it solidified, and the friction
of the scoriform cakes against one another, produced a crackling sound.
Within the crevices a dull red heat might be seen by night, and vapor
issuing in considerable quantity was visible by day.<a name="FNanchor_570" id="FNanchor_570"></a><a href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a></p>

<p>It was stated that when the lava of 1819 arrived at the head of the
Valley of Calanna, after flowing down the Val del Bove, it descended
in a cascade. This stream, in fact, like many previous currents of
lava which have flowed down successively from the higher regions of
Etna, was turned by a great promontory projecting from the southern
side of the Val del Bove. This promontory consists of the hills called
Zocolaro and Calanna, and of a ridge of inferior height which connects
them. (See <a href="#f53">fig. 53</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 53.</span><a name="f53" id="f53"></a>

<p class="small"><i>b</i>, Lavas of 1811 and 1819 flowing round the hill of Calanna.</p></div>

<p>It happened in 1811 and 1819 that the flows of lava overtopped the
ridge intervening between the hills of Zocolaro and Calanna, so that
they fell in a cascade over a lofty precipice, and began to fill up the
valley of Calanna (<i>a</i>, <a href="#f53">fig. 53</a>). Other portions of the same lava-current
(<i>b</i>) flowed round the promontory, and they exhibit one of the peculiar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
characteristics of such streams, namely that of becoming solid externally,
even while yet in motion. Instead of thinning out gradually at their
edges, their sides may often be compared to two rocky walls which are
sometimes inclined at an angle of between thirty and forty degrees.
When such streams are turned from their course by a projecting rock,
they move right onwards in a new direction; and in the Valley of
Calanna a considerable space has thus been left between the steep sides
of the lavas <i>b b</i>, so deflected, and the precipitous escarpment of Zocolaro,
A, which bounds the plain C.</p>

<p><i>Lavas and breccias.</i>&mdash;In regard to the volcanic masses which are intersected
by dikes in the Val del Bove, they consist in great part of
graystone lavas, of an intermediate character between basalt and
trachyte, and partly of porphyritic lava resembling trachyte, but to
which that name cannot, according to Von Buch and G. Rose, be in
strictness applied, because the felspar belongs to the variety called
Labradorite. There is great similarity in the composition of the ancient
and modern lavas of Etna, both consisting of felspar, augite, olivine,
and titaniferous iron. The alternating breccias are made up of scori&aelig;,
sand, and angular blocks of lava. Many of these fragments may have
been thrown out by volcanic explosions, which, falling on the hardened
surface of moving lava-currents, may have been carried to a considerable
distance. It may also happen that when lava advances very
slowly, in the manner of the flow of 1819, the angular masses resulting
from the frequent breaking of the mass as it rolls over upon
itself, may produce these breccias. It is at least certain that the upper
portion of the lava-currents of 1811 and 1819 now consist of angular
masses to the depth of many yards. D'Aubuisson has compared the
surface of one of the ancient lavas of Auvergne to that of a river suddenly
frozen over by the stoppage of immense fragments of drift-ice, a
description perfectly applicable to these modern Etnean flows. The
thickness of the separate beds of conglomerate or breccia which are seen
in the same vertical section, is often extremely different, varying from
3 to nearly 50 feet, as I observed in the hill of Calanna.</p>

<p><i>Flood produced by the melting of snow by lava.</i>&mdash;It is possible that
some of the breccias or conglomerates may be referred to aqueous
causes, as great floods occasionally sweep down the flanks of Etna,
when eruptions take place in winter, and when the snows are melted
by lava. It is true that running water in general exerts no power on
Etna, the rain which falls being immediately imbibed by the porous
lavas; so that, vast as is the extent of the mountain, it feeds only a few
small rivulets, and these, even, are dry throughout the greater portion
of the year. The enormous rounded boulders, therefore, of felspar-porphyry
and basalt, a line of which can be traced from the sea, from
near Giardini, by Mascali, and Zafarana, to the "Val del Bove," would
offer a perplexing problem to the geologist, if history had not preserved
the memorials of a tremendous flood which happened in this district in
the year 1755. It appears that two streams of lava flowed in that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span>
year, on the 2d of March, from the highest crater; they were immediately
precipitated upon an enormous mass of snow which then covered
the whole mountain, and was extremely deep near the summit. The
sudden melting of this frozen mass, by a fiery torrent three miles in
length, produced a frightful inundation, which devastated the sides of
the mountain for eight miles in length, and afterwards covered the lower
flanks of Etna, where they were less steep, together with the plains near
the sea, with great deposits of sand, scori&aelig;, and blocks of lava.</p>

<p>Many absurd stories circulated in Sicily respecting this event; such as
that the water was boiling, and that it was vomited from the highest
crater; that it was as salt as the sea, and full of marine shells; but
these were mere inventions, to which Recupero, although he relates
them as tales of the mountaineers, seems to have attached rather too
much importance.</p>

<p>Floods of considerable violence have also been produced on Etna by
the fall of heavy rains, aided, probably, by the melting of snow. By
this cause alone, in 1761, sixty of the inhabitants of Acicatena were
killed, and many of their houses swept away.<a name="FNanchor_571" id="FNanchor_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a></p>

<p><i>Glacier covered by a lava-stream.</i>&mdash;A remarkable discovery was made
on Etna in 1828 of a great mass of ice, preserved for many years, perhaps
for centuries, from melting, by the singular accident of a current
of red-hot lava having flowed over it. The following are the facts in
attestation of a phenomenon which must at first sight appear of so paradoxical
a character. The extraordinary heat experienced in the South
of Europe, during the summer and autumn of 1828, caused the supplies
of snow and ice which had been preserved in the spring of that
year, for the use of Catania and the adjoining parts of Sicily and the
island of Malta, to fail entirely. Great distress was consequently felt
for want of a commodity regarded in those countries as one of the necessaries
of life rather than an article of luxury, and the abundance of
which contributes in some of the larger cities to the salubrity of the
water and the general health of the community. The magistrates of
Catania applied to Signor M. Gemmellaro, in the hope that his local
knowledge of Etna might enable him to point out some crevice or natural
grotto on the mountain, where drift-snow was still preserved.
Nor were they disappointed; for he had long suspected that a small
mass of perennial ice at the foot of the highest cone was part of a large
and continuous glacier covered by a lava-current. Having procured a
large body of workmen, he quarried into this ice, and proved the superposition
of the lava for several hundred yards, so as completely to
satisfy himself that nothing but the subsequent flowing of the lava over
the ice could account for the position of the glacier. Unfortunately for
the geologist, the ice was so extremely hard, and the excavation so expensive,
that there is no probability of the operations being renewed.</p>

<p>On the first of December, 1828, I visited this spot, which is on the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span>
southeast side of the cone, and not far above the Casa Inglese; but the
fresh snow had already nearly filled up the new opening, so that it had
only the appearance of the mouth of a grotto. I do not, however,
question the accuracy of the conclusion of Signer Gemmellaro, who,
being well acquainted with all the appearances of drift-snow in the fissures
and cavities of Etna, had recognized, even before the late excavations,
the peculiarity of the position of the ice in this locality. We may suppose
that, at the commencement of the eruption, a deep mass of drift-snow
had been covered by volcanic sand showered down upon it before
the descent of the lava. A dense stratum of this fine dust mixed with
scori&aelig; is well known to be an extremely bad conductor of heat; and
the shepherds in the higher regions of Etna are accustomed to provide
water for their flocks during summer, by strewing a layer of volcanic
sand a few inches thick over the snow, which effectually prevents the
heat of the sun from penetrating.</p>

<p>Suppose the mass of snow to have been preserved from liquefaction
until the lower part of the lava had consolidated, we may then readily
conceive that a glacier thus protected, at the height of ten thousand
feet above the level of the sea, would endure as long as the snows of
Mont Blanc, unless melted by volcanic heat from below. When I
visited the great crater in the beginning of winter (December 1st, 1828),
I found the crevices in the interior incrusted with thick ice, and in
some cases hot vapors were actually streaming out between masses of
ice and the rugged and steep walls of the crater.<a name="FNanchor_572" id="FNanchor_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a></p>

<p>After the discovery of Signor Gemmellaro, it would not be surprising
to find in the cones of the Icelandic volcanoes, which are covered for
the most part with perpetual snow, repeated alternations of lava-streams
and glaciers. We have, indeed, Lieutenant Kendall's authority for the
fact that Deception Island, in New South Shetland, lat. 62&deg; 55' S., is
principally composed of alternate layers of volcanic ashes and
ice.<a name="FNanchor_573" id="FNanchor_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a></p>

<p><i>Origin of the Val del Bove.</i>&mdash;It is recorded, as will be stated in the
history of earthquakes (ch. 29), that in the year 1772 a great subsidence
took place on Papandayang, the largest volcano in the island of
Java; an extent of ground <i>fifteen miles in length</i>, <i>and six in breadth</i>,
covered by no less than forty villages, was engulphed, and the cone
lost 4000 feet of its height. In like manner the summit of Carguairazo,
one of the loftiest of the Andes of Quito, fell in on the 19th July, 1698;
and another mountain of still greater altitude in the same chain, called
Capac Urcu, a short time before the conquest of America by the Spaniards.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
It will also be seen in the next chapter that, so late as the year 1822,
during a violent earthquake and volcanic eruption in Java, one side of
the mountain called Galongoon, which was covered by a dense forest,
became an enormous gulf in the form of a semicircle. The new cavity
was about midway between the summit and the plain, and surrounded
by steep rocks.</p>

<p>Now we might imagine a similar event, or a series of subsidences to
have formerly occurred on the eastern side of Etna, although such
catastrophes have not been witnessed in modern times, or only on a
very trifling scale. A narrow ravine, about a mile long, twenty feet
wide, and from twenty to thirty-six in depth, has been formed, within
the historical era, on the flanks of the volcano, near the town of Mascalucia;
and a small circular tract, called the Cisterna, near the summit,
sank down in the year 1792, to the depth of about forty feet, and left
on all sides of the chasm a vertical section of the beds, exactly resembling
those which are seen in the precipices of the Val del Bove. At
some remote periods, therefore, we might suppose more extensive portions
of the mountain to have fallen in during great earthquakes.</p>

<p>But we ought not to exclude entirely from our speculations another
possible agency, by which the great cavity may in part at least have
been excavated, namely, the denuding action of the sea. Whether its
waves may once have had access to the great valley before the ancient
portion of Etna was upheaved to its present elevation, is a question
which will naturally present itself to every geologist. Marine shells
have been traced to a height of 800 feet above the base of Etna, and
would doubtless be seen to ascend much higher, were not the structure
of the lower region of the mountain concealed by floods of lava. We
cannot ascertain to what extent a change in the relative level of land
and sea may have been carried in this spot, but we know that some of
the tertiary strata in Sicily of no ancient date reach a height of 3000
feet, and the marine deposits on the flanks of Etna, full of recent species
of shells, may ascend to equal or greater heights. The narrow Valley
of Calanna leading out of the Val del Bove, and that of San Giacomo
lower down, have much the appearance of ravines swept out by aqueous
action.</p>

<p><i>Structure and origin of the cone of Etna.</i>&mdash;Our data for framing a
correct theory of the manner in which the cone of Etna has acquired its
present dimensions and internal structure are very imperfect, because it
is on its eastern side only, in the Val del Bove above described, that we
see a deep section exposed. Even here we obtain no insight into the
interior composition of the mountain beyond a depth of between three
and four thousand feet below the base of that highest cone, which has
been several times destroyed and renewed. The precipices seen at the
head of the Val del Bove, in the escarpment called the Serre del Solfizio,
exhibit merely the same series of alternating lavas and breccias,
which, descending with a general dip towards the sea, form the boundary
cliffs of all other parts of the Val del Bove. If then we estimate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
the height of Etna at about 11,000 feet, we may say that we know
from actual observation less than one-half of its component materials,
assuming it to extend downwards to the level of the sea; namely, first,
the highest cone, which is about 1000 feet above its base; and, secondly,
the alternations of lava, tuff, and volcanic breccia, which constitute
the rocks between the Cisterna, near the base of the upper cone, and
the foot of the precipices at the head of the Val del Bove. At the
lowest point to which the vertical section extends, there are no signs of
any approach to a termination of the purely volcanic mass, which may
perhaps penetrate many thousand feet farther downwards. There is,
indeed, a rock called Rocca Gianicola, near the foot of the great escarpment,
which consists of a large mass between 150 and 200 feet wide,
not divided into beds, and almost resembling granite in its structure,
although agreeing very closely in mineral composition with the lavas of
Etna in general.<a name="FNanchor_574" id="FNanchor_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a> This mass may doubtless be taken as a representative
of those crystalline or plutonic formations which would be met with
in abundance if we could descend to greater depths in the direction of
the central axis of the mountain. For a great body of geological evidence
leads us to conclude, that rocks of this class result from the consolidation,
under great pressure, of melted matter, which has risen up
and filled rents and chasms, such, for example, as may communicate
with the principal and minor vents of eruption in a volcano like Etna.</p>

<p>But, if we speculate on the nature of the formation which the lava
may have pierced in its way upwards, we may fairly presume that a
portion of these consist of marine tertiary rocks, like those of the neighboring
Val di Noto, or those which skirt the borders of the Etnean cone,
on its southern and eastern sides. Etna may, in fact, have been at first
an insular volcano, raising its summit but slightly above the level of the
sea; but we have no grounds for concluding that any of the beds exposed
in the deep section of the Val del Bove have formed a part of such
a marine accumulation. On the contrary, all the usual signs of subaqueous
origin are wanting; and even if we believe the foundations of
the mountain to have been laid in the sea, we could not expect this portion
to be made visible in sections which only proceed downwards from
the summit through one-half the thickness of the mountain, especially as
the highest points attained by the tertiary strata in other parts of Sicily
very rarely exceed 3000 feet above the sea.</p>

<p>On the eastern and southern base of Etna, a marine deposit, already
alluded to, is traced up to the height of 800 or 1000 feet, before it becomes
concealed beneath that covering of modern lavas which is continually
extending its limits during successive eruptions, and prevents us
from ascertaining how much higher the marine strata may ascend. As
the imbedded shells belong almost entirely to species now inhabiting
the Mediterranean, it is evident that there has been here an upheaval of
the region at the base of Etna at a very modern period. It is fair, therefore,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
to infer that the volcanic nucleus of the mountain, partly perhaps of
submarine, and partly of subaerial origin, participated in this movement,
and was carried up bodily. Now, in proportion as a cone gains height
by such a movement, combined with the cumulative effects of eruptions,
throwing out matter successively from one or more central vents, the
hydrostatic pressure of the columns of lava augments with their increasing
height, until the time arrives when the flanks of the cone can no
longer resist the increased pressure; and from that period they give
way more readily, lateral outbursts becoming more frequent. Hence,
independently of any local expansion of the fractured volcanic mass,
those general causes by which the modern tertiary strata of a great part
of Sicily have been raised to the height of several thousand feet above
their original level, would tend naturally to render the discharge of lava
and scori&aelig; from the summit of Etna less copious, and the lateral discharge
greater.</p>

<p>If, then, a conical or dome-shaped mass of volcanic materials was
accumulated to the height of 4000, or perhaps 7000 feet, before the upward
movement began, or, what is much more probable, during the
continuance of the upward movement, that ancient mass would not be
buried under the products of newer eruptions, because these last would
then be poured out chiefly at a lower level.</p>

<p>Since I visited Etna in 1828, M. de Beaumont has published a most
valuable memoir on the structure and origin of that mountain, which he
examined in 1834;<a name="FNanchor_575" id="FNanchor_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a> and an excellent description of it has also appeared
in the posthumous work of Hoffmann.<a name="FNanchor_576" id="FNanchor_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a></p>

<p>In M. de Beaumont's essay, in which he has explained his views with
uncommon perspicuity and talent, he maintains that all the alternating
stony and fragmentary beds, more than 3000 feet thick, which are exposed
in the Val del Bove, were formed originally on a surface so nearly
flat that the slope never exceeded three degrees. From this horizontal
position they were at length heaved up suddenly (d'un seul coup) into a
great mountain, to which no important additions have since been made.
Prior to this upthrow, a platform is supposed to have existed above the
level of the sea, in which various fissures opened; and from these melted
matter was poured forth again and again, which spread itself around
in thin sheets of uniform thickness. From the same rents issued showers
of scori&aelig; and fragmentary matter, which were spread out so as to form
equally uniform and horizontal beds, intervening between the sheets of
lava. But although, by the continued repetition of these operations, a
vast pile of volcanic matter, 4000 feet or more in thickness, was built up
precisely in that region where Etna now rises, and to which nothing
similar was produced elsewhere in Sicily, still we are told that Etna was
not yet a mountain. No hypothetical diagram has been given to help
us to conceive how this great mass of materials of supramarine origin
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
could have been disposed of in horizontal beds, so as not to constitute
an eminence towering far above the rest of Sicily; but it is assumed that
a powerful force from below at length burst suddenly through the horizontal
formation, uplifted it to a considerable height, and caused the beds
to be, in many places, highly inclined. This elevatory force was not all
expended on a single central point as Von Buch has imagined in the case
of Palma, Teneriffe, or Somma, but rather followed for a short distance
a linear direction.<a name="FNanchor_577" id="FNanchor_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a></p>

<p>Among other objections that may be advanced against the theory
above proposed, I may mention, first, that the increasing number of
dikes as we approach the head of the Val del Bove, or the middle of
Etna, and the great thickness of lava, scori&aelig;, and conglomerates in that
region, imply that the great centre of eruption was always where it now
is, or nearly at the same point, and there must, therefore, have been a
tendency, from the beginning, to a conical or dome-shaped arrangement
in the ejected materials. Secondly, were we to admit a great number
of separate points of eruption, scattered over a plain or platform, there
must have been a great number of cones thrown up over these different
vents; and these hills, some of which would probably be as lofty as
those now seen on the flanks of Etna, or from 300 to 750 feet in height,
would break the continuity of the sheets of lava, while they would become
gradually enveloped by them. The ejected materials, moreover,
would slope at a high angle on the sides of these cones, and where they
fell on the surrounding plain, would form strata thicker near the base
of each cone than at a distance.</p>

<p>What then are the facts, it will be asked, to account for which this
hypothesis of original horizontality, followed by a single and sudden
effort of upheaval, which gave to the beds their present slope, has been
invented? M. de Beaumont observes, that in the boundary precipices
of the Val del Bove, sheets of lava and intercalated beds of cinders,
mixed with pulverulent and fragmentary matter evidently cast out
during eruptions, are sometimes inclined at steep angles, varying from
15&deg; to 27&deg;. It is impossible, he says, that the lavas could have flowed
originally on planes so steeply inclined, for streams which descend a
slope even of 10&deg; form narrow stripes, and never acquire such a compact
texture. Their thickness, moreover, always inconsiderable, varies
with every variation of steepness, in the declivity down which they flow;
whereas, in several parts of the Val del Bove, the sheets of lava are
continuous for great distances, in spite of their steep inclination, and are
often compact, and perfectly parallel one to the other, even where there
are more than 100 beds of interpolated fragmentary matter.</p>

<p>The intersecting dikes also terminate upwards in many instances, at
different elevations, and blend (or, as M. de Beaumont terms it, articulate)
with sheets of lava, which they meet at right angles. It is therefore
assumed that such dikes were the feeders of the streams of lava
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
with which they unite, and they are supposed to prove that the platform,
on the surface of which the melted matter was poured out, was
at first so flat, that the fluid mass spread freely and equally in every
direction, and not towards one point only of the compass, as would
happen if it had descended the sloping sides of a cone. This argument
is ingeniously and plainly put in the following terms:&mdash;"Had the
melted matter poured down an inclined plane, after issuing from a rent,
the sheet of lava would, after consolidation, have formed an elbow with
the dike, like the upper bar of the letter F, instead of extending itself
on both sides like that of a T."<a name="FNanchor_578" id="FNanchor_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> It is also contended that a series of
sheets of lava, formed on a conical or dome-shaped mountain, would
have been more numerous at points farthest from the central axis, since
every dike which had been the source of a lava-stream, must have poured
its contents downwards, and never upwards.</p>
<p class="center2">Fig. 54.</p>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><a name="f54" id="f54"></a><img src="images/f54.png" width="450" height="277" alt="Dikes as they would now appear had they been originally perpendicular." title="" />

<p class="center2">Dikes as they would now appear had they been originally perpendicular.</p></div>

<p>In reference to the facts here stated, I may mention that the dikes
which I saw in the Val del Bove were either vertical, or made almost
all of them a near approach to the perpendicular, which could not have
been the case had they been the feeders of horizontal beds of lava, and
had they consequently joined them originally at right angles, for then
the dikes, as at <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, <a href="#f54">fig. 54</a>, ought subsequently to have acquired a
considerable slope, like the beds which they intersect. I may also urge
another objection to the views above set forth, namely, that had the
dikes been linear vents, or orifices of eruption, we must suppose the
inter-stratified scori&aelig; and lapilli, as well as the lavas, to have come
out of them, and in that case the irregular heaping up of fragmentary
matter around the vents would, as before hinted, have disturbed that
uniform thickness and parallelism of the beds which M. de Beaumont
describes.</p>

<p>If, however, some of the sheets of lava join the dikes in such a manner,
as to imply that they were in a melted state simultaneously with
the contents of the fissures,&mdash;a point not easily ascertained, where the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
precipices are for the most part inaccessible,&mdash;the fact may admit of a
different interpretation from that proposed by the French geologists.
Rents like those before alluded to (p. 399), which opened in the plain
of S. Lio in 1669, filled below with incandescent lava, may have lain in
the way of currents of melted matter descending from higher openings.
In that case, the matter of the current would have flowed into the
fissure and mixed with the lava at its bottom. Numerous open rents of
this kind are described by Mr. Dana as having been caused, during a late
eruption, in one of the volcanic domes of the Sandwich Islands. They
remained open at various heights on the slopes of the great cone, running
in different directions, and demonstrate the possibility of future junctions
of slightly inclined lava-streams with perpendicular walls of lava.</p>

<p>To me, therefore, it appears far more easy to explain the uniform
thickness and parallelism of so many lavas and beds of fragmentary
matter seen in the Val del Bove, by supposing them to have issued
successively out of one or more higher vents near the summit of a great
dome, than to imagine them to have proceeded from lateral dikes or
rents opening in a level plain. In the Sandwich Islands, we have examples
of volcanic domes 15,000 feet high, produced by successive outpourings
from vents at or near the summit. One of these, Mount Loa,
has a slope in all directions of 6&deg; 30'; another, Mount Kea, a mean
inclination of 7&deg; 46'. That their lavas may occasionally consolidate on
slopes of 25&deg;, and even more, and still preserve considerable solidity of
texture, has been already stated; see above, p. <a href="#Page_383">383</a>.</p>

<p>We know not how large a quantity of modern lava may have been
poured into the bottom of the Val del Bove, yet we perceive that eruptions
breaking forth near the centre of Etna have already made some
progress in filling up this great hollow. Even within the memory of
persons now living, the rocks of Musara and Capra have, as before
stated, lost much of their height and picturesque grandeur by the piling
up of recent lavas round their base (see <a href="#f51">fig. 51</a>, p. 408), and the great
chasm has intercepted many streams which would otherwise have deluged
the fertile region below, as has happened on the side of Catania.
The volcanic forces are now laboring, therefore, to repair the breach
which subsidence has caused on one side of the great cone; and unless
their energy should decline, or a new sinking take place, they may in
time efface this inequality. In that event, the restored portion will always
be unconformable to the more ancient part, yet it will consist, like
it, of alternating beds of lava, scori&aelig;;, and conglomerates, which, with
all their irregularities, will have a general slope from the centre and
summit of Etna towards the sea.</p>

<p>I shall conclude, then, by remarking that I conceive the general inclination
of the alternating stony and fragmentary beds of the Val del
Bove, from the axis of Etna towards its circumference or base, and the
greater thickness of the volcanic pile as we approach the central parts of
the mountain, to be due to the preponderance of eruptions from that
centre. These gave rise, from the first, to a dome-shaped mass, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
has ever since been increasing in height and area, being fractured again
and again by the expansive force of vapors, and the several parts made
to cohere together more firmly after the solidification of the lava with
which every open fissure and chasm has been filled. At the same time
the cone may have gained a portion of its height by the elevatory effect
of such dislocating movements, and the sheets of lava may have acquired
in some places a greater, in others a less, inclination than that which at
first belonged to them.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 55.</span><a name="f55" id="f55"></a><img src="images/f55.png" width="450" height="103" alt="Non-volcanic protuberance and valley of elevation." title="" />

<p class="center2">Non-volcanic protuberance and valley of elevation.</p></div>

<p>But had the mountain been due solely, or even principally, to upheaval,
its structure would have resembled that which geologists have so
often recognized in dome-shaped hills, or certain elevated regions, which
all consider as having been thrust up by a force from below. In this case
there is often an elliptical cavity at the summit, due partly to the fracture
of the upraised rocks, but still more to aqueous denudation, as they
rose out of the sea. The central cavity, or valley, exposes to view the
subjacent formation <i>c</i>, <a href="#f55">fig. 55</a>, and the incumbent mass dips away on all
sides from the axis, but has no tendency to thin out near the base of the
dome, or at <i>x</i>, <i>x</i>; whereas at this point the volcanic mass terminates
(see <a href="#f56">fig. 56</a>) and allows the fundamental rock <i>c</i> to appear at the surface.
In the last diagram, the more ordinary case is represented of a great
hollow or crater at the summit of the volcanic cone; but instead of
this, we have seen that in the case of Etna there is a deep lateral depression,
called the Val del Bove, the upper part of which approaches
near to the central axis, and the origin of which we have attributed to
subsidence.</p>

<p><i>Antiquity of the cone of Etna.</i>&mdash;It was before remarked that confined
notions in regard to the quantity of past time have tended, more than
any other prepossessions, to retard the progress of sound theoretical
views in geology;<a name="FNanchor_579" id="FNanchor_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a> the inadequacy of our conceptions of the earth's
antiquity having cramped the freedom of our speculations in this science,
very much in the same way as a belief in the existence of a vaulted firmament
once retarded the progress of astronomy. It was not until
Descartes assumed the indefinite extent of the celestial spaces, and removed
the supposed boundaries of the universe, that just opinions began
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>
to be entertained of the relative distances of the heavenly bodies; and
until we habituate ourselves to contemplate the possibility of an indefinite
lapse of ages having been comprised within each of the modern
periods of the earth's history, we shall be in danger of forming most
erroneous and partial views in geology.</p>

<p>If history had bequeathed to us a faithful record of the eruptions of
Etna, and a hundred other of the principal active volcanoes of the globe,
during the last three thousand years,&mdash;if we had an exact account of the
volume of lava and matter ejected during that period, and the times
of their production,&mdash;we might, perhaps, be able to form a correct estimate
of the average rate of the growth of a volcanic cone. For we
might obtain a mean result from the comparison of the eruptions of so
great a number of vents, however irregular might be the development
of the igneous action in any one of them, if contemplated singly during
a brief period.</p>

<p>It would be necessary to balance protracted periods of inaction against
the occasional outburst of paroxysmal explosions. Sometimes we should
have evidence of a repose of seventeen centuries, like that which was
interposed in Ischia, between the end of the fourth century <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, and the
beginning of the fourteenth century of our era.<a name="FNanchor_580" id="FNanchor_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a> Occasionally a tremendous
eruption, like that of Jorullo, would be recorded, giving rise,
at once, to a considerable mountain.</p>

<p>If we desire to approximate to the age of a cone such as Etna, we
ought first to obtain some data in regard to the thickness of matter
which has been added during the historical era, and then endeavor to
estimate the time required for the accumulation of such alternating lavas
and beds of sand and scori&aelig; as are superimposed upon each other in the
Val del Bove; afterwards we should try to deduce, from observations
on other volcanoes, the more or less rapid increase of burning mountains
in all the different stages of their growth.</p>

<p>There is a considerable analogy between the mode of increase of a
volcanic cone and that of trees of <i>exogenous</i> growth. These trees augment,
both in height and diameter, by the successive application externally
of cone upon cone of new ligneous matter; so that if we make a
transverse section near the base of the trunk, we intersect a much greater
number of layers than nearer to the summit. When branches occasionally
shoot out from the trunk, they first pierce the bark, and then, after
growing to a certain size, if they chance to be broken off, they may become
inclosed in the body of the tree, as it augments in size, forming
knots in the wood, which are themselves composed of layers of ligneous
matter, cone within cone.</p>

<p>In like manner, a volcanic mountain, as we have seen, consists of a
succession of conical masses enveloping others, while lateral cones, having
a similar internal structure, often project, in the first instance, like
branches from the surface of the main cone, and then becoming buried
again, are hidden like the knots of a tree.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
We can ascertain the age of an oak or pine by counting the number
of concentric rings of annual growth seen in a transverse section near
the base, so that we may know the date at which the seedling began to
vegetate. The Baobab-tree of Senegal (<i>Adansonia digitata</i>) is supposed
to exceed almost any other in longevity. Adanson inferred that one
which he measured, and found to be thirty feet in diameter, had attained
the age of 5150 years. Having made an incision to a certain depth, he
first counted three hundred rings of annual growth, and observed what
thickness the tree had gained in that period. The average rate of growth
of younger trees, of the same species, was then ascertained, and the
calculation made according to a supposed mean rate of increase. De
Candolle considers it not improbable that the celebrated Taxodium of
Chapultepec, in Mexico (<i>Cupressus disticha</i>, Linn.), which is 117 feet in
circumference, may be still more aged.<a name="FNanchor_581" id="FNanchor_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a></p>

<p>It is, however, impossible, until more data are collected respecting
the average intensity of the volcanic action, to make any thing like an
approximation to the age of a cone like Etna; because, in this case, the
successive envelopes of lava and scori&aelig; are not continuous, like the layers
of wood in a tree, and afford us no definite measure of time. Each conical
envelope is made up of a great number of distinct lava-currents and
showers of sand and scori&aelig;, differing in quantity, and which may have
been accumulated in unequal periods of time. Yet we cannot fail to
form the most exalted conception of the antiquity of this mountain, when
we consider that its base is about ninety miles in circumference; so that
it would require ninety flows of lava, each a mile in breadth at their
termination, to raise the present foot of the volcano as much as the
average height of one lava-current.</p>

<p>There are no records within the historical era which lead to the opinion
that the altitude of Etna has materially varied within the last two
thousand years. Of the eighty most conspicuous minor cones which
adorn its flanks, only one of the largest, Monti Rossi, has been produced
within the times of authentic history. Even this hill, thrown up in the
year 1669, although 450 feet in height, only ranks as a cone of second
magnitude. Monte Minardo, near Bronte, rises, even now, to the height
of 750 feet, although its base has been elevated by more modern lavas
and ejections. The dimensions of these larger cones appear to bear
testimony to <i>paroxysms</i> of volcanic activity, after which we may conclude,
from analogy, that the fires of Etna remained dormant for many
years&mdash;since nearly a century of rest has sometimes followed a violent
eruption in the historical era. It must also be remembered, that of the
small number of eruptions which occur in a century, one only is estimated
to issue from the summit of Etna for every two that proceed from
the sides. Nor do all the lateral eruptions give rise to such cones as
would be reckoned amongst the smallest of the eighty hills above enumerated;
some of them produce merely insignificant monticules, which
are soon afterwards buried by showers of ashes.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>
How many years then must we not suppose to have been expended
in the formation of the eighty cones? It is difficult to imagine that a
fourth part of them have originated during the last thirty centuries.
But if we conjecture the whole of them to have been formed in twelve
thousand years, how inconsiderable an era would this portion of time
constitute in the history of the volcano! If we could strip off from
Etna all the lateral monticules now visible, together with the lavas and
scori&aelig; that have been poured out from them, and from the highest
crater, during the period of their growth, the diminution of the entire
mass would be extremely slight: Etna might lose, perhaps, several
miles in diameter at its base, and some hundreds of feet in elevation;
but it would still be the loftiest of Sicilian mountains, studded with
other cones, which would be recalled, as it were, into existence by the
removal of the rocks under which they are now buried.</p>

<p>There seems nothing in the deep sections of the Val del Bove to indicate
that the lava-currents of remote periods were greater in volume
than those of modern times; and there are abundant proofs that the
countless beds of solid rock and scori&aelig; were accumulated, as now, in
succession. On the grounds, therefore, already explained, we must
infer that a mass so many thousand feet in thickness must have required
an immense series of ages anterior to our historical periods for its growth;
yet the whole must be regarded as the product of a modern portion of
the tertiary epoch. Such, at least, is the conclusion that seems to follow
from geological data, which show that the oldest parts of the mountain,
if not of posterior date to the marine strata around its base, were
at least of coeval origin.</p>

<p>Some geologists contend, that the sudden elevation of large continents
from beneath the waters of the sea have again and again produced
waves which have swept over vast regions of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_582" id="FNanchor_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a> But it is
clear that no devastating wave has passed over the forest zone of Etna
since any of the lateral cones before mentioned were thrown up; for
none of these heaps of loose sand and scori&aelig; could have resisted for a
moment the denuding action of a violent flood. To some, perhaps, it
may appear that hills of such incoherent materials cannot be of very
great antiquity, because the mere action of the atmosphere must, in the
course of several thousand years, have obliterated their original forms.
But there is no weight in this objection; for the older hills are covered
with trees and herbage, which protect them from waste; and, in regard
to the newer ones, such is the porosity of their component materials,
that the rain which falls upon them is instantly absorbed; and for the
same reason that the rivers on Etna have a subterranean course, there
are none descending the sides of the minor cones.</p>

<p>No sensible alteration has been observed in the form of these cones
since the earliest periods of which there are memorials; and there
seems no reason for anticipating that in the course of the next ten
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
thousand or twenty thousand years they will undergo any great alteration
in their appearance, unless they should be shattered by earthquakes
or covered by volcanic ejections.</p>

<p>In other parts of Europe, as in Auvergne and Velay, in France,
similar loose cones of scori&aelig;, probably of as high antiquity as the whole
mass of Etna, stand uninjured at inferior elevations above the level of
the sea.</p>

<p><i>Volcanic eruptions in Iceland.</i>&mdash;With the exception of Etna and Vesuvius,
the most complete chronological records of a series of eruptions
are those of Iceland, for their history reaches as far back as the ninth
century of our era; and, from the beginning of the twelfth century,
there is clear evidence that, during the whole period, there has never
been an interval of more than forty, and very rarely one of twenty years,
without either an eruption or a great earthquake. So intense is the
energy of the volcanic action in this region, that some eruptions of
Hecla have lasted six years without ceasing. Earthquakes have often
shaken the whole island at once, causing great changes in the interior,
such as the sinking down of hills, the rending of mountains, the desertion
by rivers of their channels, and the appearance of new lakes.<a name="FNanchor_583" id="FNanchor_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a>
New islands have often been thrown up near the coast, some of which
still exist; while others have disappeared, either by subsidence or the
action of the waves.</p>

<p>In the interval between eruptions, innumerable hot springs afford
vent to subterranean heat, and solfataras discharge copious streams of
inflammable matter. The volcanoes in different parts of this island are
observed, like those of the Phlegr&aelig;an Fields, to be in activity by turns,
one vent often serving for a time as a safety-valve to the rest. Many
cones are often thrown up in one eruption, and in this case they take a
linear direction, running generally from northeast to southwest, from
the northeastern part of the island, where the volcano Krabla lies, to
the promontory Reykianas.</p>

<i>New island thrown up in 1783.</i>&mdash;The convulsions of the year 1783
appear to have been more tremendous than any recorded in the modern
annals of Iceland; and the original Danish narrative of the catastrophe,
drawn up in great detail, has since been substantiated by several English
travellers, particularly in regard to the prodigious extent of country laid
waste, and the volume of lava produced.<a name="FNanchor_584" id="FNanchor_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> About a month previous to
the eruption on the mainland, a submarine volcano burst forth in the sea
in lat. 63&deg; 25' N., long. 23&deg; 44' W., at a distance of thirty miles in a
southwest direction from Cape Reykianas, and ejected so much pumice,
that the ocean was covered with that substance to the distance of 150
miles, and ships were considerably impeded in their course. A new
island was thrown up, consisting of high cliffs, within which fire, smoke,
and pumice were emitted from two or three different points. This island
was claimed by his Danish Majesty, who denominated it Ny&ouml;e, or the
New Island; but before a year had elapsed, the sea resumed its ancient
domain, and nothing was left but a reef of rocks from five to thirty
fathoms under water.</p>

<p><i>Great eruption of Skapt&aacute;r Jokul.</i>&mdash;Earthquakes which had long been
felt in Iceland, became violent on the 11th of June, 1783, when Skapt&aacute;r
Jokul, distant nearly 200 miles from Ny&ouml;e, threw out a torrent of lava
which flowed down into the river Skapt&acirc;, and completely dried it up.
The channel of the river was between high rocks, in many places from
four hundred to six hundred feet in depth, and near two hundred in
breadth. Not only did the lava fill up this great defile to the brink, but
it overflowed the adjacent fields to a considerable extent. The burning
flood, on issuing from the confined rocky gorge, was then arrested for
some time by a deep lake, which formerly existed in the course of the
river, between Skaptardal and Aa, which it entirely filled. The current
then advanced again, and reaching some ancient lava full of subterraneous
caverns, penetrated and melted down part of it; and in some
places, where the steam could not gain vent, it blew up the rock,
throwing fragments to the height of more than 150 feet. On the 18th
of June another ejection of liquid lava rushed from the volcano, which
flowed down with amazing velocity over the surface of the first stream.
By the damming up of the mouths of some of the tributaries of the
Skapt&acirc;, many villages were completely overflowed with water, and thus
great destruction of property was caused. The lava, after flowing for
several days, was precipitated down a tremendous cataract called Stapafoss,
where it filled a profound abyss, which that great waterfall had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">426</a></span>
been hollowing out for ages, and after this, the fiery current again continued
its course.</p>

<p>On the third of August, fresh floods of lava still pouring from the
volcano, a new branch was sent off in a different direction; for the
channel of the Skapt&acirc; was now so entirely choked up, and every opening
to the west and north so obstructed, that the melted matter was
forced to take a new course, so that it ran in a southeast direction, and
discharged itself into the bed of the river Hverfisfliot, where a scene of
destruction scarcely inferior to the former was occasioned. These Icelandic
lavas (like the ancient streams which are met with in Auvergne,
and other provinces of Central France), are stated by Stephenson to
have accumulated to a prodigious depth in narrow rocky gorges; but
when they came to wide alluvial plains, they spread themselves out into
broad burning lakes, sometimes from twelve to fifteen miles wide, and
one hundred feet deep. When the "fiery lake" which filled up the
lower portion of the valley of the Skapt&acirc;, had been augmented by new
supplies, the lava flowed up the course of the river to the foot of the
hills from whence the Skapt&acirc; takes its rise. This affords a parallel case
to one which can be shown to have happened at a remote era in the
volcanic region of the Vivarais in France, where lava issued from the
cone of Thueyts, and while one branch ran down, another more powerful
stream flowed up the channel of the river Ard&ecirc;che.</p>

<p>The sides of the valley of the Skapt&acirc; present superb ranges of basaltic
columns of older lava, resembling those which are laid open in the valleys
descending from Mont Dor, in Auvergne, where more modern lava-currents,
on a scale very inferior in magnitude to those of Iceland, have
also usurped the beds of the existing rivers. The eruption of Skapt&aacute;r
Jokul did not entirely cease till the end of two years; and when Mr.
Paulson visited the tract eleven years afterwards, in 1794, he found
columns of smoke still rising from parts of the lava, and several rents
filled with hot water.<a name="FNanchor_585" id="FNanchor_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a></p>

<p>Although the population of Iceland was very much scattered, and did
not exceed fifty thousand, no less than twenty villages were destroyed,
besides those inundated by water; and more than nine thousand human
beings perished, together with an immense number of cattle, partly by
the depredations of the lava, partly by the noxious vapors which impregnated
the air, and, in part, by the famine caused by showers of ashes
throughout the island, and the desertion of the coasts by the fish.</p>

<p><i>Immense volume of the lava.</i>&mdash;But the extraordinary volume of melted
matter produced in this eruption deserves the particular attention of the
geologist. Of the two branches, which flowed in nearly opposite directions,
the greatest was fifty, and the lesser forty miles in length. The
extreme breadth which the Skapt&acirc; branch attained in the low countries
was from twelve to fifteen miles, that of the other about seven. The
ordinary height of both currents was one hundred feet, but in narrow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">427</a></span>
defiles it sometimes amounted to six hundred. Professor Bischoff has
calculated that the mass of lava brought up from the subterranean
regions by this single eruption "surpassed in magnitude the bulk of
Mont Blanc."<a name="FNanchor_586" id="FNanchor_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor">586</a> But a more distinct idea will be formed of the dimensions
of the two streams, if we consider how striking a feature they
would now form in the geology of England, had they been poured out
on the bottom of the sea after the deposition and before the elevation of
our secondary and tertiary rocks. The same causes which have excavated
valleys through parts of our marine strata, once continuous, might
have acted with equal force on the igneous rocks, leaving, at the same
time, a sufficient portion undestroyed to enable us to discover their former
extent. Let us, then, imagine the termination of the Skapt&aacute; branch
of lava to rest on the escarpment of the inferior and middle oolite, where
it commands the vale of Gloucester. The great platform might be one
hundred feet thick, and from ten to fifteen miles broad, exceeding any
which can be found in Central France. We may also suppose great
tabular masses to occur at intervals, capping the summit of the Cotswold
Hills between Gloucester and Oxford, by Northleach, Burford, and
other towns. The wide valley of the Oxford clay would then occasion
an interruption for many miles; but the same rocks might recur on the
summit of Cumnor and Shotover Hills, and all the other oolitic eminences
of that district. On the chalk of Berkshire, extensive plateaus,
six or seven miles wide, would again be formed; and lastly, crowning
the highest sands of Highgate and Hampstead, we might behold some
remnants of the current five or six hundred feet in thickness, causing
those hills to rival, or even to surpass, in height, Salisbury Craigs and
Arthur's Seat.</p>

<p>The distance between the extreme points here indicated would not
exceed ninety miles in a direct line; and we might then add, at the distance
of nearly two hundred miles from London, along the coast of
Dorsetshire and Devonshire, for example, a great mass of igneous rocks,
to represent those of contemporary origin, which were produced beneath
the level of the sea, where the island of Ny&ouml;e rose up.</p>

<p><i>Volume of ancient and modern flows of lava compared.</i>&mdash;Yet, gigantic
as must appear the scale of these modern volcanic operations, we must
be content to regard them as perfectly insignificant in comparison to
currents of the primeval ages, if we embrace the theoretical views of
many geologists, which were not inaccurately expressed by the late Professor
Alexander Brongniart, when he declared that "aux &eacute;poques
g&eacute;ognostiques anciennes, tous les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes g&eacute;ologiques se passoient
dans des dimensions <i>centuples</i> de celles qu'ils pr&eacute;sentent aujourd'hui."<a name="FNanchor_587" id="FNanchor_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor">587</a>
Had Skapt&aacute;r Jokul, therefore, been a volcano of the olden time, it would
have poured forth lavas at a single eruption a hundred times more voluminous
than those which were witnessed by the present generation in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span>
1783. But it may, on the contrary, be affirmed that, among the older
formations, no igneous rock of such colossal magnitude has yet been met
with; nay, it would be most difficult to point out a mass of ancient date
(distinctly referable to a single eruption) which would even rival in
volume the matter poured out from Skapt&aacute;r Jokul in 1783.</p>

<p><i>Eruption of Jorullo in 1759.</i>&mdash;As another example of the stupendous
scale of modern volcanic eruptions, I may mention that of Jorullo in
Mexico, in 1759. The great region to which this mountain belongs has
already been described. The plain of Malpais forms part of an elevated
platform, between two and three thousand feet above the level of the
sea, and is bounded by hills composed of basalt, trachyte, and volcanic
tuff, clearly indicating that the country had previously, though probably
at a remote period, been the theatre of igneous action. From the era
of the discovery of the New World to the middle of the last century, the
district had remained undisturbed, and the space, now the site of the
volcano, which is thirty-six leagues distant from the nearest sea, was
occupied by fertile fields of sugar-cane and indigo, and watered by the
two brooks Cuitimba and San Pedro. In the month of June, 1759,
hollow sounds of an alarming nature were heard, and earthquakes succeeded
each other for two months, until, at the end of September, flames
issued from the ground, and fragments of burning rocks were thrown to
prodigious heights. Six volcanic cones, composed of scori&aelig; and fragmentary
lava, were formed on the line of a chasm which ran in the direction
from N. N. E. to S. S. W. The least of these cones was 300 feet in
height; and Jorullo, the central volcano, was elevated 1600 feet above
the level of the plain. It sent forth great streams of basaltic lava, containing
included fragments of granitic rocks, and its ejections did not
cease till the month of February, 1760.<a name="FNanchor_588" id="FNanchor_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 57.</span><a name="f57" id="f57"></a><img src="images/f57.png" width="550" height="63" alt="Summit of Jorullo." title="" />

<p class="center2"><i>a</i>, Summit of Jorullo. <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, Inclined plane sloping at an angle of 6&deg; from the base of the cones.</p></div>

<p>Humboldt visited the country more than forty years after this occurrence,
and was informed by the Indians, that when they returned, long
after the catastrophe, to the plain, they found the ground uninhabitable
from the excessive heat. When he himself visited the place, there
appeared, around the base of the cones, and spreading from them, as
from a centre, over an extent of four square miles, a mass of matter of
a convex form, about 550 feet high at its junction with the cones, and
gradually sloping from them in all directions towards the plain. This
mass was still in a heated state, the temperature in the fissures being on
the decrease from year to year, but in 1780 it was still sufficient to light
a cigar at the depth of a few inches. On this slightly convex protuberance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
the slope of which must form an angle of about 6&deg; with the horizon,
were thousands of flattish conical mounds, from six to nine feet high,
which, as well as large fissures traversing the plain, acted as fumeroles,
giving out clouds of sulphurous acid and hot aqueous vapor. The two
small rivers before mentioned disappeared during the eruption, losing
themselves below the eastern extremity of the plain, and reappearing as
hot springs at its western limit.</p>

<p><i>Cause of the convexity of the plain of Malpais.</i>&mdash;Humboldt attributed
the convexity of the plain to inflation from below; supposing the ground,
for four square miles in extent, to have risen up in the shape of a bladder
to the elevation of 550 feet above the plain in the highest part.
But Mr. Scrope has suggested that the phenomena may be accounted
for far more naturally, by supposing that lava flowing simultaneously
from the different orifices, and principally from Jorullo, united
into a sort of pool or lake. As they were poured forth on a surface
previously flat, they would, if their liquidity was not very great, remain
thickest and deepest near their source, and diminish in bulk from thence
towards the limits of the space which they covered. Fresh supplies
were probably emitted successively during the course of an eruption
which lasted more than half a year; and some of these, resting on those
first emitted, might only spread to a small distance from the foot of the
cone, where they would necessarily accumulate to a great height. The
average slope of the great dome-shaped volcanoes of the Sandwich
Islands, formed almost exclusively of lava, with scarce any scori&aelig;, is
between 6&deg; 30' and 7&deg; 46', so that the inclination of the convex mass
around Jorullo, if we adopt Mr. Scrope's explanation (see <a href="#f57">fig. 57</a>), is
quite in accordance with the known laws which govern the flow of lava.</p>

<p>The showers, also, of loose and pulverulent matter from the six craters,
and principally from Jorullo, would be composed of heavier and
more bulky particles near the cones, and would raise the ground at
their base, where, mixing with rain, they might have given rise to the
stratum of black clay, which is described as covering the lava. The
small conical mounds (called "hornitos," or little ovens) may resemble
those five or six small hillocks which existed in 1823 on the Vesuvian
lava, and sent forth columns of vapor, having been produced by the
disengagement of elastic fluids heaping up small dome-shaped masses
of lava. The fissures mentioned by Humboldt as of frequent occurrence,
are such as might naturally accompany the consolidation of a thick bed
of lava, contracting as it congeals; and the disappearance of rivers is
the usual result of the occupation of the lower part of a valley or plain
by lava, of which there are many beautiful examples in the old lava-currents
of Auvergne. The heat of the "hornitos" is stated to have
diminished from the first; and Mr. Bullock, who visited the spot many
years after Humboldt, found the temperature of the hot spring very
low,&mdash;a fact which seems clearly to indicate the gradual congelation of
a subjacent bed of lava, which from its immense thickness may have
been enabled to retain its heat for half a century. The reader may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
reminded, that when we thus suppose the lava near the volcano to have
been, together with the ejected ashes, more than five hundred feet in
depth, we merely assign a thickness which the current of Skapt&aacute;r Jokul
attained in some places in 1783.</p>

<p><i>Hollow sound of the plain when struck.</i>&mdash;Another argument adduced
in support of the theory of inflation from below, was, the hollow sound
made by the steps of a horse upon the plain; which, however, proves
nothing more than that the materials of which the convex mass is composed
are light and porous. The sound called "rimbombo" by the
Italians is very commonly returned by <i>made ground</i> when struck sharply;
and has been observed not only on the sides of Vesuvius and other volcanic
cones where there is a cavity below, but in such regions as the
Campagna di Roma, composed in a great measure of tuff and porous
volcanic rocks. The reverberation, however, may perhaps be assisted
by grottoes and caverns, for these may be as numerous in the lavas of
Jorullo as in many of those of Etna; but their existence would lend no
countenance to the hypothesis of a great arched cavity, four square
miles in extent, and in the centre 550 feet high.<a name="FNanchor_589" id="FNanchor_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a></p>

<p><i>No recent eruptions of Jorullo.</i>&mdash;In a former edition I stated that I
had been informed by Captain Vetch, that in 1819 a tower at Guadalaxara
was thrown down by an earthquake, and that ashes, supposed to
have come from Jorullo, fell at the same time at Guanaxuato, a town
situated 140 English miles from the volcano. But Mr. Burkhardt, a
German director of mines, who examined Jorullo in 1827, ascertained
that there had been no eruption there since Humboldt's visit in 1803.
He went to the bottom of the crater, and observed a slight evolution of
sulphurous acid vapors, but the "hornitos" had entirely ceased to send
forth steam. During the twenty-four years intervening between his
visit and that of Humboldt, vegetation had made great progress on the
flanks of the new hills; the rich soil of the surrounding country was
once more covered with luxuriant crops of sugar-cane and indigo, and
there was an abundant growth of natural underwood on all the uncultivated
tracts.<a name="FNanchor_590" id="FNanchor_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a></p>

<p><i>Galongoon, Java</i>, 1822.&mdash;The mountain of Galongoon (or Galung
Gung) was in 1822 covered by a dense forest, and situated in a fruitful
and thickly-peopled part of Java. There was a circular hollow at its
summit, but no tradition existed of any former eruption. In July, 1822,
the waters of the river Kunir, one of those which flowed from its flanks,
became for a time hot and turbid. On the 8th of October following a
loud explosion was heard, the earth shook, and immense columns of hot
water and boiling mud, mixed with burning brimstone, ashes, and lapilli,
of the size of nuts, were projected from the mountain like a waterspout,
with such prodigious violence that large quantities fell beyond the river
Tandoi, which is forty miles distant. Every valley within the range of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>
this eruption became filled with a burning torrent, and the rivers, swollen
with hot water and mud, overflowed their banks, and carried away
great numbers of the people, who were endeavoring to escape, and the
bodies of cattle, wild beasts, and birds. A space of twenty-four miles
between the mountain and the river Tandoi was covered to such a
depth with bluish mud that people were buried in their houses, and
not a trace of the numerous villages and plantations throughout that
extent was visible. Within this space the bodies of those who perished
were buried in mud and concealed, but near the limits of the volcanic
action they were exposed, and strewed over the ground in great numbers,
partly boiled and partly burnt.</p>

<p>It was remarked, that the boiling mud and cinders were projected
with such violence from the mountain, that while many remote villages
were utterly destroyed and buried, others much nearer the volcano
were scarcely injured.</p>

<p>The first eruption lasted nearly five hours, and on the following days
the rain fell in torrents, and the rivers, densely charged with mud,
deluged the country far and wide. At the end of four days (October
12th) a second eruption occurred more violent than the first, in which
hot water and mud were again vomited, and great blocks of basalt were
thrown to the distance of seven miles from the volcano. There was at
the same time a violent earthquake, and in one account it is stated that the
face of the mountain was utterly changed, its summits broken down, and
one side, which had been covered with trees, became an enormous gulf
in the form of a semicircle. This cavity was about midway between the
summit and the plain, and surrounded by steep rocks, said to be newly
heaped up during the eruption. New hills and valleys are said to have
been formed, and the rivers Banjarang and Wulan changed their course,
and in one night (October 12th) 2000 persons were killed.</p>

<p>The first intimation which the inhabitants of Bandong received of this
calamity on the 8th of October, was the news that the river Wulna was
bearing down into the sea the dead bodies of men, and the carcasses of
stags, rhinoceroses, tigers, and other animals. The Dutch painter Payen
determined to travel from thence to the volcano, and he found that the
quantity of the ashes diminished as he approached the base of the mountain.
He alludes to the altered form of the mountain after the 12th,
but does not describe the new semicircular gulf on its side.</p>

<p>The official accounts state that 114 villages were destroyed, and above
4000 persons killed.<a name="FNanchor_591" id="FNanchor_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a></p>

<p><i>Submarine volcanoes.</i>&mdash;Although we have every reason to believe that
volcanic eruptions as well as earthquakes are common in the bed of the
sea, it was not to be expected that many opportunities would occur to
scientific observers of witnessing the phenomena. The crews of vessels
have sometimes reported that they have seen in different places sulphur
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span>ous
smoke, flame, jets of water, and steam, rising up from the sea, or
they have observed the waters greatly discolored, and in a state of violent
agitation as if boiling. New shoals have also been encountered, or
a reef of rocks just emerging above the surface, where previously there
was always supposed to have been deep water. On some few occasions
the gradual formation of an island by a submarine eruption has been observed,
as that of Sabrina, in the year 1811, off St. Michael's in the
Azores. The throwing up of ashes in that case, and the formation of
a cone about three hundred feet in height, with a crater in the centre,
closely resembled the phenomena usually accompanying a volcanic eruption
on land. Sabrina was soon washed away by the waves. Previous
eruptions in the same part of the sea were recorded to have happened
in 1691 and 1720. The rise of Ny&ouml;e, also, a small island off the coast
of Iceland, in 1783, has already been alluded to; and another volcanic
isle was produced by an eruption near Reikiavig, on the same coast, in
June, 1830.<a name="FNanchor_592" id="FNanchor_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a></p>

<p><i>Graham Island</i><a name="FNanchor_593" id="FNanchor_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a>, 1831.&mdash;We have still more recent and minute information
respecting the appearance, in 1831, of a new volcanic island in
the Mediterranean, between the S. W. coast of Sicily and that projecting
part of the African coast where ancient Carthage stood. The site of the
island was not any part of the great shoal, or bank, called "Nerita," as
was first asserted, but a spot where Captain W. H. Smyth had found,
in his survey a few years before, a depth of more than one hundred
fathoms water.<a name="FNanchor_594" id="FNanchor_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a></p>

<p>The position of the island (lat. 37&deg; 8' 30" N., long. 12&deg; 42' 15" E.)
was about thirty miles S. W. of Sciacca, in Sicily, and thirty-three miles
N. E. of Pantellaria.<a name="FNanchor_595" id="FNanchor_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a> On the 28th of June, about a fortnight before
the eruption was visible, Sir Pulteney Malcolm, in passing over the spot
in his ship, felt the shocks of an earthquake, as if he had struck on a
sand-bank; and the same shocks were felt on the west coast of Sicily,
in a direction from S. W. to N. E. About the 10th of July, John
Corrao, the captain of a Sicilian vessel, reported that, as he passed near
the place, he saw a column of water like a water-spout, sixty feet high,
and 800 yards in circumference, rising from the sea, and soon afterwards
a dense steam in its place, which ascended to the height of 1800 feet.
The same Corrao, on his return from Girgenti, on the 18th of July,
found a small island, twelve feet high with a crater in its centre, ejecting
volcanic matter, and immense columns of vapor; the sea around being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
covered with floating cinders and dead fish. The scori&aelig; were of a
chocolate color, and the water which boiled in the circular basin was of
a dingy red. The eruption continued with great violence to the end of
the same month; at which time the island was visited by several persons,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">434</a></span>
and among others by Capt. Swinburne, R. N., and M. Hoffmann,
the Prussian geologist. It was then from fifty to ninety feet in height,
and three-quarters of a mile in circumference. By the 4th of August
it became, according to some accounts, above 200 feet high, and three
miles in circumference; after which it began to diminish in size by the
action of the waves, and it was only two miles round on the 25th of
August; and on the 3d of September, when it was carefully examined
by Captain Wodehouse, only three-fifths of a mile in circumference; its
greatest height being then 107 feet. At this time the crater was about 780
feet in circumference. On the 29th of September, when it was visited
by Mons. C. Prevost, its circumference was reduced to about 700 yards.
It was composed entirely of incoherent ejected matter, scori&aelig;, pumice,
and lapilli, forming regular strata, some of which are described as having
been parallel to the steep inward slope of the crater, while the rest
were inclined outwards, like those of Vesuvius.<a name="FNanchor_598" id="FNanchor_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a> When the arrangement
of the ejected materials has been determined by their falling continually
on two steep slopes, that of the external cone and that of the crater,
which is always a hollow inverted cone, a transverse section would
probably resemble that given in the annexed figure (<a href="#f61">61</a>). But when I
visited Vesuvius, in 1828, I saw no beds of scori&aelig; inclined towards the
axis of the cone. (See <a href="#f45">fig. 45</a>, p. 381.) Such may have once existed;
but the explosions or subsidences, or whatever causes produced the
great crater of 1822, had possibly destroyed them.</p>

<p>Few of the pieces of stone thrown out from Graham Island exceeded
a foot in diameter. Some fragments of dolomitic limestone were intermixed;
but these were the only non-volcanic substances. During the
month of August, there occurred on the S. W. side of the new island
a violent ebullition and agitation of the sea, accompanied by the constant
ascension of a column of dense white steam, indicating the existence
of a second vent at no great depth from the surface. Towards
the close of October, no vestige of the crater remained, and the island
was nearly levelled with the surface of the ocean, with the exception,
at one point, of a small monticule of sand and scori&aelig;. It was reported
that, at the commencement of the year following (1832), there was a
depth of 150 feet where the island had been: but this account was
quite erroneous; for in the early part of that year Captain Swinburne
found a shoal and discolored water there, and towards the end of 1833
a dangerous reef existed of an oval figure, about three-fifths of a mile
in extent. In the centre was a black rock, of the diameter of about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
twenty-six fathoms, from nine to eleven feet under water; and round
this rock are banks of black volcanic stones and loose sand. At the
distance of sixty fathoms from this central mass, the depth increased
rapidly. There was also a second shoal at the distance of 450 feet
S. W. of the great reef, with fifteen feet water over it, also composed
of rock, surrounded by deep sea. We can scarcely doubt that the rock
in the middle of the larger reef is solid lava, which rose up in the principal
crater, and that the second shoal marks the site of the submarine
eruption observed in August, 1831, to the S. W. of the island.</p>

<p>From the whole of the facts above detailed, it appears that a hill
eight hundred feet or more in height was formed by a submarine volcanic
vent, of which the upper part (only about two hundred feet high)
emerged above the waters, so as to form an island. This cone must
have been equal in size to one of the largest of the lateral volcanoes on
the flanks of Etna, and about half the height of the mountain Jorullo
in Mexico, which was formed in the course of nine months, in 1759. In
the centre of the new volcano a large cavity was kept open by gaseous
discharges, which threw out scori&aelig;; and fluid lava probably rose up
in this cavity. It is not uncommon for small subsidiary craters to open
near the summit of a cone, and one of these may have been formed in
the case of Graham Island; a vent, perhaps, connected with the main
channel of discharge which gave passage in that direction to elastic
fluids, scori&aelig;, and melted lava. It does not appear that, either from
this duct, or from the principal vent, there was any overflowing of lava;
but melted rock may have flowed from the flanks or base of the cone
(a common occurrence on land), and may have spread in a broad sheet
over the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>The dotted lines in the annexed figure are an imaginary restoration
of the upper part of the cone, now removed by the waves: the strong
lines represent the part of the volcano which is still under water: in
the centre is a great column, or dike, of solid lava, two hundred feet in
diameter, supposed to fill the space by which the gaseous fluids rose;
and on each side of the dike is a stratified mass of scori&aelig; and fragmentary
lava. The solid nucleus of the reef, where the black rock is now
found, withstands the movements of the sea; while the surrounding
loose tuffs are cut away to a somewhat lower level. In this manner the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_436" id="Page_436">436</a></span>
lava, which was the lowest part of the island, or, to speak more correctly,
which scarcely ever rose above the level of the sea when the
island existed, has now become the highest point in the reef.</p>

<p>No appearances observed, either during the eruption or since the
island disappeared, gave the least support to the opinion promulgated
by some writers, that part of the ancient bed of the sea had been lifted
up bodily.</p>

<p>The solid products, says Dr. John Davy, whether they consisted of
sand, light cinders, or vesicular lava, differed more in form than in
composition. The lava contained augite; and the specific gravity was
2&middot;07 and 2&middot;70. When the light spongy cinder, which floated on the
sea, was reduced to fine powder by trituration, and the greater part of
the entangled air got rid of, it was found to be of the specific gravity
2&middot;64; and that of some of the sand which fell in the eruption was
2&middot;75;<a name="FNanchor_600" id="FNanchor_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a> so that the materials equalled ordinary granites in weight and
solidity. The only gas evolved in any considerable quantity was carbonic
acid.<a name="FNanchor_601" id="FNanchor_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor">601</a></p>

<p><i>Submarine eruptions in mid-Atlantic.</i>&mdash;In the Nautical Magazine for
1835, p. 642, and for 1838, p. 361, and in the Comptes Rendus, April,
1838, accounts are given of a series of volcanic phenomena, earthquakes,
troubled water, floating scori&aelig; and columns of smoke, which have been
observed at intervals since the middle of the last century, in a space of
open sea between longitudes 20&deg; and 22&deg; west, about half a degree
south of the equator. These facts, says Mr. Darwin, seem to show,
that an island or an archipelago is in process of formation in the middle
of the Atlantic; a line joining St. Helena and Ascension would, if prolonged,
intersect this slowly nascent focus of volcanic action.<a name="FNanchor_602" id="FNanchor_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor">602</a> Should
land be eventually formed here, it will not be the first that has been
produced by igneous action in this ocean since it was inhabited by the
existing species of testacea. At Porto Praya in St. Jago, one of the
Azores, a horizontal, calcareous stratum occurs, containing shells of
recent marine species, covered by a great sheet of basalt eighty feet
thick.<a name="FNanchor_603" id="FNanchor_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor">603</a> It would be difficult to estimate too highly the commercial
and political importance which a group of islands might acquire, if in
the next two or three thousand years they should rise in mid-ocean
between St. Helena and Ascension.</p>

<h6>CANARY ISLANDS.</h6>

<p><i>Eruption in Lancerote, 1730 to 1736.</i>&mdash;The effects of an eruption
which happened in Lancerote, one of the Canary Islands, between the
years 1730 and 1736, were very remarkable; and a detailed description
has been published by Von Buch, who had an opportunity, when
he visited that island in 1815, of comparing the accounts transmitted to
us of the event, with the present state and geological appearances of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span>
country.<a name="FNanchor_604" id="FNanchor_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor">604</a> On the 1st of September, 1730, the earth split open on a
sudden two leagues from Yaira. In one night a considerable hill of
ejected matter was thrown up; and, a few days later, another vent
opened, and gave out a lava-stream, which overran Chinanfaya and
other villages. It flowed first rapidly, like water, but became afterwards
heavy and slow, like honey. On the 7th of September an immense
rock was protruded from the bottom of the lava with a noise like
thunder, and the stream was forced to change its course from N. to
N. W., so that St. Catalina and other villages were overflowed.</p>

<p>Whether this mass was protruded by an earthquake, or was a mass
of ancient lava, blown up like that before mentioned in 1783 in Iceland,
is not explained.</p>

<p>On the 11th of September more lava flowed out, and covered the
village of Maso entirely, and for the space of eight days precipitated
itself with a horrible roar into the sea. Dead fish floated on the waters
in indescribable multitudes, or were thrown dying on the shore. After
a brief interval of repose, three new openings broke forth immediately
from the site of the consumed St. Catalina, and sent out an enormous
quantity of lapilli, sand, and ashes. On the 28th of October the cattle
throughout the whole country dropped lifeless to the ground, suffocated
by putrid vapors, which condensed and fell down in drops. On the
1st of December a lava-stream reached the sea, and formed an island,
round which dead fish were strewed.</p>

<p><i>Number of cones thrown up.</i>&mdash;It is unnecessary here to give the
details of the overwhelming of other places by fiery torrents, or of a
storm which was equally new and terrifying to the inhabitants, as they
had never known one in their country before. On the 10th of January,
1731, a high hill was thrown up, which, on the same day, precipitated
itself back again into its own crater; fiery brooks of lava flowed from it
to the sea. On the 3d of February a new cone arose. Others were
thrown up in March, and poured forth lava-streams. Numerous other
volcanic cones were subsequently formed in succession, till at last their
number amounted to about thirty. In June, 1731, during a renewal of
the eruptions, all the banks and shores in the western part of the island
were covered with dying fish, of different species, some of which had
never before been seen. Smoke and flame arose from the sea, with
loud detonations. These dreadful commotions lasted without interruption
for <i>five successive years</i>, so that a great emigration of the inhabitants
became necessary.</p>

<p><i>Their linear direction.</i>&mdash;As to the height of the new cones, Von Buch
was assured that the formerly great and flourishing St. Catalina lay
buried under hills 400 feet in height; and he observes that the most
elevated cone of the series rose 600 feet above its base, and 1378 feet
above the sea, and that several others were nearly as high. The new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">438</a></span>
vents were all arranged <i>in one line</i>, about two geographical miles long,
and in a direction nearly east and west. If we admit the probability of
Von Buch's conjecture, that these vents opened along the line of a cleft,
it seems necessary to suppose that this subterranean fissure was only
prolonged upwards to the surface by degrees, and that the rent was
narrow at first, as is usually the case with fissures caused by earthquakes.
Lava and elastic fluids might escape from some point on the
rent where there was least resistance, till, the first aperture becoming
obstructed by ejections and the consolidation of lava, other orifices burst
open in succession along the line of the original fissure. Von Buch
found that each crater was lowest on that side on which lava had
issued; but some craters were not breached, and were without any lava
streams. In one of these were open fissures, out of which hot vapors
rose, which in 1815 raised the thermometer to 145&deg; Fahrenheit, and
was probably at the boiling point lower down. The exhalations
seemed to consist of aqueous vapor; yet they could not be pure steam,
for the crevices were incrusted on either side by siliceous sinter (an
opal-like hydrate of silica of a white color), which extended almost to
the middle. This important fact attests the length of time during
which chemical processes continue after eruptions, and how open fissures
may be filled up laterally by mineral matter, sublimed from volcanic
exhalations. The lavas of this eruption covered nearly a third of the
whole island, often forming on slightly inclined planes great horizontal
sheets several square leagues in area, resembling very much the basaltic
platforms of Auvergne.</p>

<p><i>Pretended distinction between ancient and modern lavas.</i>&mdash;One of the
new lavas was observed to contain masses of olivine of an olive-green
color, resembling those which occur in one of the lavas of the Vivarais.
Von Buch supposes the great crystals of olivine to have been derived
from a previously existing basalt melted up by the new volcanoes; but
we have scarcely sufficient data to bear out such a conjecture. The
older rocks of the island consist, in a great measure, of that kind
of basaltic lava called dolerite, sometimes columnar, and partly of common
basalt and amygdaloid. Some recent lavas assumed, on entering
the sea, a prismatic form, and so much resembled the older lavas of
the Canaries, that the only geological distinction which Von Buch
appears to have been able to draw between them was, that they did
not alternate with conglomerates, like the ancient basalts. Some
modern writers have endeavored to discover, in the abundance of these
conglomerates, a proof of the dissimilarity of the volcanic action in
ancient and modern times; but this character is more probably attributable
to the difference between submarine operations and those on the
land. All the blocks and imperfectly rounded fragments of lava, transported
during the intervals of eruption, by rivers and torrents, into the
adjoining sea, or torn by the continued action of the waves from cliffs
which are undermined, must accumulate in stratified breccias and conglomerates,
and be covered again and again by other lavas. This is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_439" id="Page_439">439</a></span>
now taking place on the shores of Sicily, between Catania and Trezza,
where the sea breaks down and covers the shore with blocks and pebbles
of the modern lavas of Etna; and on parts of the coast of Ischia,
where numerous currents of trachyte are in like manner undermined in
lofty precipices. So often, then, as an island is raised in a volcanic
archipelago by earthquakes from the deep, the fundamental and (relatively
to all above) the oldest lava will often be distinguishable from
those formed by subsequent eruptions on dry land, by their alternation
with beds of sandstone and fragmentary rocks.</p>

<p>The supposed want of identity, then, between the volcanic phenomena
of different epochs resolves itself partly at least into the marked difference
between the operations simultaneously in progress, above and below
the waters. Such, indeed, is the source, as was before stated in the First
Book (Chap. V.), of many of our strongest theoretical prejudices in geology.
No sooner do we study and endeavor to explain submarine appearances,
than we feel, to use a common expression, out of our element;
and unwilling to concede that our extreme ignorance of processes now
continually going on can be the cause of our perplexity, we take refuge
in a "pre-existent order of nature."</p>

<p><i>Recent formation of oolitic travertin in Lancerote.</i>&mdash;Throughout a considerable
part of Lancerote, the old lavas are covered by a thin stratum
of limestone, from an inch to two feet in thickness. It is of a hard stalactitic
nature, sometimes oolitic, like the Jura limestone, and contains fragments
of lava and terrestrial shells, chiefly helices and spiral bulimi. It
sometimes rises to the height of 800 feet above the level of the sea. Von
Buch imagines that this remarkable superstratum has been produced by
the furious northwest storms, which in winter drive the spray of the sea
in clouds over the whole island; from whence calcareous particles may
be deposited stalactitically. Mr. Darwin informs me that he found a
limestone in St. Helena, the harder parts of which correspond precisely to
the stone of Lancerote. He attributes the origin of this rock in St. Helena
not to the spray of the sea, but to drifting by violent winds of the finer
particles of shells from the sea-beach. Some parts of this drift are subsequently
dissolved by atmospheric moisture, and redeposited, so as to
convert calcareous sand into oolite.</p>

<p><i>Recent eruption in Lancerote.</i>&mdash;From the year 1736 to 1815, when Von
Buch visited Lancerote, there had been no eruption; but, in August, 1824,
a crater opened near the port of Rescif, and formed by its ejections, in
the space of twenty-four hours, a considerable hill. Violent earthquakes
preceded and accompanied this eruption.<a name="FNanchor_605" id="FNanchor_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor">605</a></p>

<p><i>Teneriffe.</i>&mdash;The Peak of Teneriffe is about 12,000 feet high, and stands,
says Von Buch, like a tower encircled by its fosse and bastion. The bastion
consists, like the semicircular escarpment of Somma turned towards
Vesuvius, of precipitous cliffs, composed of trachyte, basalt, coarse conglomerates,
and tuffs, traversed by volcanic dikes, mostly vertical, and of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">440</a></span>
basalt. These cliffs vary in height from 1000 to 1800 feet, and are supposed
by Von Buch to have been heaved up into their present position
by a force exerted from below, in accordance with the theory proposed
by the same author for the origin of the cones of Vesuvius and Etna.
According to the observations of M. Deville in 1839<a name="FNanchor_606" id="FNanchor_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor">606</a>, the trachytes are
often granitoid in their aspect, and contain instead of glassy felspar the
allied mineral called oligoclase, which had been previously considered as
characteristic of more ancient igneous rocks. The same traveller supposes,
although he found no limestone or trace of fossils in any of the
rocks of Teneriffe, that the alternating trachytes and trachytic conglomerates
originated beneath the sea. If this opinion be correct, and it is
at least very probable, geologists may still speculate on two modes in
which the mass of the island acquired its present form and elevation
above the sea. 1st, The advocates of Von Buch's crater-of-elevation
hypothesis may imagine that a succession of horizontally superimposed
beds were upheaved by a sudden movement, and tilted so as to dip in
all directions outwards from the centre of a new dome-shaped eminence,
in the middle of which a large opening or bowl-shaped cavity was produced.
2dly, Or according to the theory which to me appears preferable,
a submarine hill in the form of a flattened dome may have gradually
accumulated, partly below the waters and partly above by the continued
outpourings of sheets of lava and the ejection of ashes from a
central orifice. In this case the dikes would represent the fissures, which
were filled during successive eruptions, and the original inclination of the
beds may have been increased by the distension and upheaval of the mass
during reiterated convulsions, acting most forcibly at or near the channel
of discharge, which would become partially sealed up with lava from time
to time, and then be burst open again during eruptions. At length the
whole island may have been raised bodily out of the sea by a gradual
upward movement.</p>

<p>Whatever theory we adopt, we must always explain the abrupt termination
of the dikes and layers of trachyte and basalt in the steep walls of
the escarpments surrounding the great crater by supposing the removal
of part of the materials once prolonged farther inward towards the centre.
If, according to the elevation-crater hypothesis, a series of sheets of lava
and ashes originally spread over a level and even surface have been violently
broken and uplifted, why do not the opposite walls of the chasm
correspond in such a manner as to imply by their present outline that
they were formerly united? It is evident that the precipices on opposite
sides of the crateriform hollow would not fit if brought together, there
being no projecting masses in one wall to enter into indentations in the
other, as would happen with the sides of many mineral veins, trap-dikes,
and faults, could we extract the intrusive matter now separating them,
and reunite the rocks which have been fractured and disjoined.</p>

<p>The highest crater of the peak has merely disengaged sulphureous
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">441</a></span>
vapors ever since it has been known to Europeans; but an eruption
happened in June, 1798, not far from the summit, and others are recorded,
which poured out streams of lava from great heights, besides
many which have broken out nearer the level of the sea. All these, however,
seem to be dependent on one great centre of eruption, or on that
open channel communicating between the interior of the earth and the
atmosphere, which terminates in the highest crater of the peak.</p>

<p>We may consider Teneriffe, then, as having been from a remote period
the principal and habitual vent of the volcanic archipelago of the
Canaries. The discharges which have taken place in the contiguous
isles of Palma, Lancerote, and the rest, may be of a subsidiary kind, and
have probably been most frequent and violent when the greater crater
has been partially sealed up, just as the violent eruptions of Ischia or
that of Monte Nuovo coincided with the dormant state of Vesuvius.</p>

<h6>SANTORIN.</h6>

<p>The Gulf of Santorin, in the Grecian Archipelago, has been for two
thousand years a scene of active volcanic operations. The largest of the
three outer islands of the group (to which the general name of Santorin
is given) is called Thera (or sometimes Santorin), and forms more than
two-thirds of the circuit of the gulf (see Map, <a href="#f63">fig. 63</a>, p. 442). The
length of the exterior coast-line of this and the other two islands named
Therasia and Aspronisi, taken together, amounts to about thirty miles,
and that of the inner coast-line of the same islands to about eighteen
miles. In the middle of the gulf are three other islands, called the
Little, the New, and the Old "Kaimenis," or "Burnt Islands." The
accompanying map has been reduced from a recent survey executed in
1848 by Captain Graves, R. N., and shortly to be published by the
Admiralty.</p>

<p class="center2">Part of the section, <a href="#f64">fig. 64</a>, enlarged.</p></div>

<p>Pliny informs us that the year 186, <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, gave birth to the Old Kaimeni,
also called Hiera, or the "Sacred Isle," and in the year 19 of our
era "Thia" (the Divine) made its appearance above water, and was soon
joined by subsequent eruptions to the older island, from which it was
only 250 paces distant. The Old Kaimeni also increased successively in
size in 726 and in 1427. A century and a half later, in 1573, another
eruption produced the cone and crater called Micra-Kaimeni, or "the
Small Burnt Island." The next great event which we find recorded
occurred in 1650, when a submarine outbreak violently agitated the sea,
at a point three and a half miles to the N. E. of Thera, and which gave
rise to a shoal (see A in the map) carefully examined during the late
survey in 1848 by Captain Graves, and found to have ten fathoms water
over it, the sea deepening around it in all directions. This eruption
lasted three months, covering the sea with floating pumice. At the same
time an earthquake destroyed many houses in Thera, while the sea broke
upon the coast and overthrew two churches, exposing to view two villages,
one on each side of the mountain of St. Stephen, both of which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">443</a></span>
must have been overwhelmed by showers of volcanic matter during some
previous eruptions of unknown date.<a name="FNanchor_607" id="FNanchor_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> The accompanying evolution of
sulphur and hydrogen issuing from the sea killed more than fifty persons,
and above 1000 domestic animals. A wave, also, 50 feet high, broke
upon the rocks of the Isle of Nia, about four leagues distant, and advanced
450 yards into the interior of the Island of Sikino. Lastly, in 1707 and
1709, Nea-Kaimeni, or the New Burnt Island, was formed between the
two others, Palaia and Micra, the Old and Little isles. This isle was
composed originally of two distinct parts; the first which rose was called
the White Island, composed of a mass of pumice, extremely porous.
Gorce, the Jesuit, who was then in Santorin, says that the rock "cut
like bread," and that, when the inhabitants landed on it, they found a
multitude of full-grown fresh oysters adhering to it, which they ate.<a name="FNanchor_608" id="FNanchor_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a>
This mass was afterwards covered, in great part, by the matter ejected
from the crater of a twin-island formed simultaneously, and called Black
Island, consisting of brown trachyte. The trachytic lava which rose on
this spot appears to have been a long time in an intumescent state, for
the New Kaimeni was sometimes lowered on one side while it gained
height on the other, and rocks rose up in the sea at different distances
from the shore and then disappeared again. The eruption was renewed
at intervals during the years 1711 and 1712, and at length a cone was
piled up to the height of 330 feet above the level of the sea, its exterior
slope forming an angle of 33&deg; with the horizon, and the crater on its
summit being 80 yards in diameter. In addition to the two points of
subaerial eruption on the New and Little Kaimenis, two other cones,
indicating the sites of submarine outbursts of unknown date, were discovered
under water near the Kaimenis during the late survey.</p>

<p>In regard to the "White Island," which was described and visited by
Gorce in 1707, we are indebted to Mr. Edward Forbes for having, in
1842, carefully investigated the layer of pumiceous ash of which it is
constituted. He obtained from it many shells of marine genera, Pectunculus,
Arca, Cardita, Trochus, and others, both univalve and bivalve, all
of recent Mediterranean species. They were in a fine state of preservation,
the bivalves with the epidermis remaining, and valves closed,
showing that they had been suddenly destroyed. Mr. Forbes, from his
study of the habits of the mollusca living at different depths in the
Mediterranean, was able to decide that such an assemblage of species
could not have lived at a less depth than 220 feet, so that a bodily upheaval
of the mass to that amount must have taken place in order to
bring up this bed of ashes and shells to the level of the sea, and they
now rise five or six feet above that level.<a name="FNanchor_609" id="FNanchor_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a></p>

<p>We may compare this partial elevation of solid matter to the rise of a
hardened crust of scori&aelig;, such as is usually formed on the surface of
lava-currents, even while they are in motion, and which, although stony
and capable of supporting heavy weights, may be upraised without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span>
bursting by the intumescence of the melted matter below. That the
upheaval was merely local is proved by the fact that the neighboring
Kaimenis did not participate in the movement, still less the three more
distant or outer islands before mentioned. The history, therefore, of
the Kaimenis shows that they have been the result of intermittent action,
and it lends no support to the hypothesis of the sudden distension of
horizontal beds blown up like a bladder by a single paroxysmal effort of
expansive gases.</p>

<p>It will be seen by the accompanying map and sections, that the Kaimenis
are arranged in a linear direction, running N. E. and S. W., in a
manner different from that represented in the older charts. In their
longest diameter they form at their base a ridge nearly bisecting the gulf
or crater (see sections, figs. <a href="#f64">64</a>, <a href="#f65">65</a>).</p>

<p>On considering these facts we are naturally led to compare the smaller
and newer islands in the centre of the gulf to the modern cone of Vesuvius,
surrounded by the older semicircular escarpment of Somma, or to
liken them to the Peak of Teneriffe before described, as surrounded by
its "fosse and bastion." This idea will appear to be still more fully
confirmed when we study the soundings taken during the late hydrographical
survey. Thera, which constitutes alone more than two-thirds
of the outer circuit, presents everywhere towards the gulf, high and
steep precipices composed of rocks of volcanic origin. In all places
near the base of its cliffs, a depth of from 800 to 1000 feet of water was
found, and Lieut. Leycester informs us<a name="FNanchor_610" id="FNanchor_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> that if the gulf, which is six
miles in diameter, could be drained, a bowl-shaped cavity would appear
with walls 2449 feet high in some places, and even on the southwest
side, where it is lowest, nowhere less than 1200 feet high; while the
Kaimenis would be seen to form in the centre a huge mountain five and
a half miles in circumference at its base, with three principal summits
(the Old, the New, and the Little Burnt Islands) rising severally to the
heights of 1251, 1629, and 1158 feet above the bottom of the abyss.
The rim of the great caldron thus exposed would be observed to be
in all parts perfect and unbroken, except at one point where there is a
deep and long chasm or channel, known by mariners as "the northern
entrance" (B, <a href="#f63">fig. 63</a>) between Thera and Therasia, and called by Lieut.
Leycester "the door into the crater." It is no less than 1170 feet
deep, and constitutes, as will appear by the soundings (see map), a remarkable
feature in the bed of the sea. There is no corresponding
channel passing out from the gulf into the Mediterranean at any other
point in the circuit between the outer islands, the greatest depth there
ranging from 7 to 66 feet.</p>

<p>We may conceive, therefore, if at some former time the whole mass
of Santorin stood at a higher level by 1200 feet, that this single ravine
or narrow valley now forming "the northern entrance," was the passage
by which the sea entered a circular bay and swept out in the form of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">445</a></span>
mud and pebbles, the materials derived by denudation from wasting
cliffs. In this manner the original crater may have been slowly widened
and deepened, after which the whole archipelago may have been partially
submerged to its present depth.</p>

<p>That such oscillations of level may in the course of ages have taken
place, will be the more readily admitted when we state that part of
Thera has actually sunk down in modern times, as, for example, during
the great earthquake before alluded to, which happened in 1650. The
subsidence alluded to is proved not only by tradition, but by the fact
that a road which formerly led between two places on the east coast of
Thera is now twelve fathoms under water.</p>

<p>MM. Boblaye and Virlet mention,<a name="FNanchor_611" id="FNanchor_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a> that the waves are constantly undermining
and encroaching on the cliffs of Therasia and Aspronisi, and
shoals or submarine ledges were found, during the late survey, to occur
round a great part of these islands, attesting the recent progress of
denudation. M. Virlet also remarks, in regard to the separation of the
three islands forming the walls of the crater, that the channels between
them are all to the W. and N. W., the quarter most exposed to
the waves and currents.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, in his work on volcanic islands, has shown that in the
Mauritius and in Santiago, there is an external circle of basaltic rocks
of vast diameter, in the interior of which more modern eruptions have
taken place, the older rocks dipping away from the central space in
every direction, as in the outer islands of Santorin. He refers the numerous
breaches, some of them very wide in the external ramparts of
those islands, to the denuding action of the sea. Every geologist, therefore,
will be prepared to call in the aid of the same powerful cause, to
account for the removal of a large part of the rocks which must once
have occupied the interior space, in the same manner as they attribute
the abstraction of matter from elliptical "valleys of elevation," such as
those of Woolhope and the Wealden in England, to the waves and currents
of the sea.</p>

<p>Thera, Therasia, and Aspronisi are all composed of volcanic matter,
except the southern part of Thera, where Mount St. Elias rises to three
times the height of the loftiest of the igneous rocks, reaching an elevation
of 1887 feet above the sea.<a name="FNanchor_612" id="FNanchor_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a> This mountain is formed of
granular limestone and argillaceous schist, and must have been originally
a submarine eminence in the bed of the Mediterranean, before
the volcanic cone, one side of the base of which now abuts against
it, was formed. The inclination, strike, and fractures of the calcareous
and argillaceous strata of St. Elias have no relation to the great cone,
but, according to M. Bory St. Vincent, have the same direction as those
of the other isles of the Grecian Archipelago, namely, from N. N. W.
to S. S. E. Each of the three islands, Thera, Therasia, and Aspronisi,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span>
is capped by an enormous mass of white tufaceous conglomerate, from
forty to fifty feet thick, beneath which are beds of trachytic lava and
tuff, having a gentle inclination of only 3&deg; or 4&deg;. Each bed is usually
very narrow and discontinuous, the successive layers being moulded or
dove-tailed, as M. Virlet expresses it, into the inequalities of the previously
existing surface, on which showers of cinders or streams of
melted matter have been poured. Nothing, therefore, seems more
evident than that we have in Santorin the basal remains of a great
ruined cone, or flattened dome; and the absence of dikes in the cliffs
surrounding the gulf would indicate that the eruptions took place originally,
as they have done in the last two thousand years, not near the
margin but in the centre of the space now occupied by the gulf. The
central portions of the dome have since been removed by engulfment,
or denudation, or by both these causes.</p>

<p>An important fact is adduced by M. Virlet, to show that the gentle
dip of the lava-streams in the three outer islands towards all points of
the compass, away from the centre of the gulf, has not been due to
the upheaval of horizontal beds, as conjectured by Von Buch, who
had not visited Santorin.<a name="FNanchor_613" id="FNanchor_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a> The French geologist found that the vesicles
or pores of the trachytic masses were lengthened out in the several
directions in which they would have flowed if they had descended
from the axis of a cone once occupying the centre of the crater. For
it is well known that the bubbles of confined gas in a fluid in motion
assume an oval form, and the direction of their longer axis coincides
always with that of the stream.</p>

<p>On a review, therefore, of all the facts now brought to light respecting
Santorin, I attribute the moderate slope of the beds in Thera and
the other external islands to their having originally descended the
inclined flanks of a large volcanic cone, the principal orifice or vents of
eruption having been always situated where they are now, in or near
the centre of the space occupied by the gulf or crater&mdash;in other words,
where the outburst of the Kaimenis has been witnessed in historical
times. The single long and deep opening into the crater is a feature
common to all those remnants of ancient volcanoes, the central portions
of which have been removed, and is probably connected with aqueous
denudation. This denuding process has been the work of ages when
the sea was admitted into an original crater, and has taken place during
the gradual emergence of the island from the sea, or during various
oscillations in its level.</p>

<p>The volcanic island of St. Paul in the midst of the Indian Ocean, lat.
38&deg; 44' S., long. 77&deg; 37' E., surveyed by Capt. Blackwood in 1842,
seems to exemplify the first stage in the formation of such an archipelago
as that of Santorin. We have there a crater one mile in diameter, surrounded
by steep and lofty cliffs on every side save one, where the sea
enters by a single passage nearly dry at low water. In the interior of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
the small circular bay or crater there is a depth of 30 fathoms, or 180
feet. The surface of the island slopes away on all sides from the crest
of the rocks encircling the crater.<a name="FNanchor_614" id="FNanchor_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a></p>

<p class="center2">Cone and crater of Barren Island, in the Bay of Bengal. Height of the central cone (according
to Capt Miller, in 1834), 500 feet.</p></div>

<p><i>Barren Island.</i>&mdash;There is great analogy between the structure of
Barren Island in the Bay of Bengal, lat. 12&deg; 15', and that of Santorin
last described. When seen from the ocean, this island presents, on almost
all sides, a surface of bare rocks, rising, with a moderate acclivity,
towards the interior; but at one point there is a cleft by which we can
penetrate into the centre, and there discover that it is occupied by a
great circular basin, filled by the waters of the sea, and bordered all
around by steep rocks, in the midst of which rises a volcanic cone, very
frequently in eruption. The summit of this cone is about 500 feet in
height, corresponding to that of the circular border which incloses the
basin; so that it can be seen from the sea only through the ravine.
It is most probable that the exterior inclosure of Barren Island (<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>,
<a href="#f67">fig. 67</a>) is nothing more than the remains of a truncated cone <i>c</i>, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>d</i>,
a great portion of which has been removed by engulfment, explosion,
or denudation, which may have preceded the formation of the new interior
cone, <i>f</i>, <i>e</i>, <i>g</i>.<a name="FNanchor_615" id="FNanchor_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a></p>

<h6>MUD VOLCANOES.</h6>

<p><i>Iceland.</i>&mdash;Mr. R. Bunsen, in his account of the pseudo-volcanic phenomena
of Iceland, describes many valleys where sulphurous and
aqueous vapors burst forth with a hissing sound, from the hot soil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span>
formed of volcanic tuff. In such spots a pool of boiling water is seen,
in which a bluish-black argillaceous paste rises in huge bubbles. These
bubbles on bursting throw the boiling mud to a height of fifteen feet and
upwards, accumulating it in ledges round the crater or basin of the spring.</p>

<p><i>Baku on the Caspian.</i>&mdash;The formation of a new mud volcano was witnessed
on the 27th of November, 1827, at Tokmali, on the peninsula
of Abscheron, east of Baku. Flames blazed up to an extraordinary
height for a space of three hours, and continued for twenty hours to
rise about three feet above a crater, from which mud was ejected. At
another point in the same district where flames issued, fragments of
rock of large size were hurled up into the air, and scattered around.<a name="FNanchor_616" id="FNanchor_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 68.</span><a name="f68" id="f68"></a><img src="images/f68.jpg" width="550" height="482" alt="Mud cones and craters of Hinglaj." title="" />

<p class="center2">Mud cones and craters of Hinglaj near Beila, district of Lus, 120 miles northwest of mouth
of Indus. From original drawing by Capt. Robertson. (See Map, p. 460.)</p></div>

<p><i>Sicily.</i>&mdash;At a place called Macaluba, near Girgenti in Sicily, are
several conical mounds from ten to thirty feet in height, with small
craters at their summits, from which cold water, mixed with mud and
bitumen, is cast out. Bubbles of carbonic acid and carburetted hydrogen
gas are also disengaged from these springs, and at certain periods
with such violence, as to throw the mud to the height of 200 feet.
These "air volcanoes," as they are sometimes termed, are known to
have been in the same state of activity for the last fifteen centuries; and
Dr. Daubeny imagines that the gases which escape may be generated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">449</a></span>
by the slow combustion of beds of sulphur, which is actually in progress
in the blue clay, out of which the springs rise.<a name="FNanchor_617" id="FNanchor_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> But as the gases
are similar to those disengaged in volcanic eruptions, and as they have
continued to stream out for so long a period, they may perhaps be
derived from a more deep-seated source.</p>

<p><i>Beila in India.</i>&mdash;In the district of Luss or Lus, south of Beila, about
120 miles N. W. of Cutch and the mouths of the Indus (see Map, fig.
<a href="#f71">71</a>, p. 460), numerous mud volcanoes are scattered over an area of probably
not less than 1000 square miles. Some of these have been well
described by Captain Hart, and subsequently by Captain Robertson, who
has paid a visit to that region, and made sketches of them, which he has
kindly placed at my disposal. From one of these the annexed view has
been selected. These conical hills occur to the westward of the Hara
mountains and the river Hubb. (See Map, p. 460.) One of the cones
is 400 feet high, composed of light-colored earth, and having at its summit
a crater thirty yards in diameter. The liquid mud which fills the
crater is continually disturbed by air-bubbles, and here and there is cast
up in small jets.<a name="FNanchor_618" id="FNanchor_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a></p>

<p><i>Mineral composition of volcanic products.</i>&mdash;The mineral called felspar
forms in general more than half of the mass of modern lavas. When it
is in great excess, lavas are called trachytic: they consist generally of a
base of compact felspar, in which crystals of glassy felspar are disseminated.<a name="FNanchor_619" id="FNanchor_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a>
When augite (or pyroxene) predominates, lavas are termed basaltic.
They contain about 50 per cent. of silica, or much less than the
trachytes, in which there is usually about 75 per cent. of that mineral.
They also contain about 11 per cent. of protoxide of iron, and as much
of lime, both of which are wanting, or only in insignificant quantities in
the trachytic rocks.<a name="FNanchor_620" id="FNanchor_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a> But lavas occur of an intermediate composition
between the trachytic and basaltic, which from their color have been
called graystones. The abundance of quartz, forming distinct crystals or
concretions, characterizes the granitic and other ancient rocks, now generally
considered by geologists as of igneous origin; whereas that mineral
is rarely exhibited in a separate form in recent lavas, although silica
enters so largely into their composition. Hornblende, so common in hypogene
rocks, or those commonly called "primary," is rare in modern
lava; nor does it enter largely into rocks of any age in which augite
abounds. It should, however, be stated, that the experiments of Mr.
Gustav Rose have made it very questionable, whether the minerals called
hornblende and augite can be separated as distinct species, as their different
varieties seem to pass into each other, whether we consider the
characters derived from their angles of crystallization, their chemical
composition, or their specific gravity. The difference in form of the two
substances may be explained by the different circumstances under which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">450</a></span>
they have been produced, the form of hornblende being the result of
slower cooling. Crystals of augite have been met with in the scori&aelig; of
furnaces, but never those of hornblende; and crystals of augite have
been obtained by melting hornblende in a platina crucible; but hornblende
itself has not been formed artificially.<a name="FNanchor_621" id="FNanchor_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a> Mica occurs plentifully in
some recent trachytes, but is rarely present where augite is in excess.</p>

<p><i>Frequency of eruptions, and nature of subterranean igneous rocks.</i>&mdash;When
we speak of the igneous rocks of our own times, we mean that
small portion which, in violent eruptions, is forced up by elastic fluids to
the surface of the earth,&mdash;the sand, scori&aelig;, and lava, which cool in the
open air. But we cannot obtain access to that which is congealed far
beneath the surface under great pressure, equal to that of many hundred,
or many thousand atmospheres.</p>

<p>During the last century, about fifty eruptions are recorded of the five
European volcanic districts, of Vesuvius, Etna, Volcano, Santorin, and
Iceland; but many beneath the sea in the Grecian archipelago and near
Iceland may doubtless have passed unnoticed. If some of them produced
no lava, others, on the contrary, like that of Skapt&aacute;r Jokul, in 1783,
poured out melted matter for five or six years consecutively; which cases,
being reckoned as single eruptions, will compensate for those of inferior
strength. Now, if we consider the active volcanoes of Europe to constitute
about a fortieth part of those already known on the globe, and calculate
that, one with another, they are about equal in activity to the burning
mountains in other districts, we may then compute that there happen
on the earth about 2000 eruptions in the course of a century, or about
twenty every year.</p>

<p>However inconsiderable, therefore, may be the superficial rocks which
the operations of fire produce on the surface, we must suppose the subterranean
changes now constantly in progress to be on the grandest scale.
The loftiest volcanic cones must be as insignificant, when contrasted to the
products of fire in the nether regions, as are the deposits formed in shallow
estuaries when compared to submarine formations accumulating in
the abysses of the ocean. In regard to the characters of these volcanic
rocks, formed in our own times in the bowels of the earth, whether in rents
and caverns, or by the cooling of lakes of melted lava, we may safely infer
that the rocks are heavier and less porous than ordinary lavas, and
more crystalline, although composed of the same mineral ingredients. As
the hardest crystals produced artificially in the laboratory require the
longest time for their formation, so we must suppose that where the cooling
down of melted matter takes place by insensible degrees, in the course
of ages, a variety of minerals will be produced far harder than any formed
by natural processes within the short period of human observation.</p>

<p>These subterranean volcanic rocks, moreover, cannot be stratified in
the same manner as sedimentary deposits from water, although it is evident
that when great masses consolidate from a state of fusion, they may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">451</a></span>
separate into natural divisions; for this is seen to be the case in many
lava-currents. We may also expect that the rocks in question will often
be rent by earthquakes, since these are common in volcanic regions; and
the fissures will be often injected with similar matter, so that dikes of
crystalline rock will traverse masses of similar composition. It is also
clear, that no organic remains can be included in such masses, as also
that these deep-seated igneous formations considered in mass must underlie
all the strata containing organic remains, because the heat proceeds
from below upwards, and the intensity required to reduce the mineral
ingredients to a fluid state must destroy all organic bodies in rocks included
in the midst of them.</p>

<p>If by a continued series of elevatory movements, such masses shall
hereafter be brought up to the surface, in the same manner as sedimentary
marine strata have, in the course of ages, been upheaved to the
summit of the loftiest mountains, it is not difficult to foresee what
perplexing problems may be presented to the geologist. He may then,
perhaps, study in some mountain-chain the very rocks produced at the
depth of several miles beneath the Andes, Iceland, or Java, in the time
of Leibnitz, and draw from them the same conclusion which that philosopher
derived from certain igneous products of high antiquity; for he
conceived our globe to have been, for an indefinite period, in the state
of a comet, without an ocean, and uninhabitable alike by aquatic or
terrestrial animals.</p>

<p>In the sketch before given of the geographical boundaries of volcanic
regions, I stated, that although the points of eruption are but thinly
scattered, constituting mere spots on the surface of those vast districts,
yet the subterranean movements extend simultaneously over immense
areas. We may now proceed to consider the changes which these
movements produce on the surface, and in the internal structure of the
earth's crust.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">452</a></span>
<i>Deficiency of ancient accounts.</i>&mdash;It is only within the last century and
a half, since Hooke first promulgated, in 1688, his views respecting the
connection between geological phenomena and earthquakes, that the
permanent changes affected by these convulsions have excited attention.
Before that time, the narrative of the historian was almost exclusively
confined to the number of human beings who perished, the number of
cities laid in ruins, the value of property destroyed, or certain atmospheric
appearances which dazzled or terrified the observers. The creation
of a new lake, the engulfing of a new city, or the raising of a new
island, are sometimes, it is true, adverted to, as being too obvious, or of
too much geographical or political interest to be passed over in silence.
But no researches were made expressly with a view of ascertaining the
amount of depression or elevation of the ground, or any particular alterations
in the relative position of sea and land; and very little distinction
was made between the raising of soil by volcanic ejections, and the upheaving
of it by forces acting from below. The same remark applies to
a very large proportion of modern accounts: and how much reason we
have to regret this deficiency of information appears from this, that in
every instance where a spirit of scientific inquiry has animated the eyewitnesses
of these events, facts calculated to throw light on former modifications
of the earth's structure are recorded.</p>

<p><i>Phenomena attending earthquakes.</i>&mdash;As I shall confine myself almost
entirely, in the following notice of earthquakes, to the changes brought
about by them in the configuration of the earth's crust, I may mention,
generally, some accompaniments of these terrible events which are
almost uniformly commemorated in history, that it may be unnecessary
to advert to them again. Irregularities in the seasons preceding or following
the shocks; sudden gusts of wind, interrupted by dead calms;
violent rains at unusual seasons, or in countries where such phenomena
are almost unknown; a reddening of the sun's disk, and a haziness in
the air, often continued for months; an evolution of electric matter, or
of inflammable gas from the soil, with sulphurous and mephitic vapors;
noises underground, like the running of carriages, or the discharge of
artillery, or distant thunder; animals uttering cries of distress, and
evincing extraordinary alarm, being more sensitive than men of the
slightest movement; a sensation like sea-sickness, and a dizziness in the
head, experienced by men:&mdash;these, and other phenomena, less connected
with our present subject as geologists, have recurred again and
again at distant ages, and in all parts of the globe.</p>

<p>I shall now begin the enumeration of earthquakes with the latest
authentic narratives, and so carry back the survey retrospectively, that
I may bring before the reader, in the first place, the minute and circumstantial
details of modern times, and thus enable him, by observing the
extraordinary amount of change within the last 150 years, to perceive
how great must be the deficiency in the meager annals of earlier eras.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">453</a></span></p>

<h6>EARTHQUAKES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.<a name="FNanchor_622" id="FNanchor_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a></h6>

<p><i>Syria</i>, January, 1837.&mdash;It has been remarked that earthquakes
affect elongated areas. The violent shock which devastated Syria in
1837 was felt on a line 500 miles in length by 90 in breadth:<a name="FNanchor_623" id="FNanchor_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a> more
than 6000 persons perished; deep rents were caused in solid rocks, and
new hot springs burst out at Tabereah.</p>

<p><i>Chili&mdash;Valdivia</i>, 1837.&mdash;One of the latest earthquakes by which the
position of solid land is known to have been permanently altered is that
which occurred in Chili, on November 7th, 1837. On that day Valdivia
was destroyed by an earthquake, and a whaler, commanded by Captain
Coste, was violently shaken at sea, and lost her masts, in lat. 43&deg; 38' S.
in sight of the land. The captain went on the 11th of December following
to a spot near the island of Lemus, one of the Chonos archipelago,
where he had anchored two years before, and found that the bottom of
the sea had been raised more than eight feet. Some rocks formerly
covered at all times by the sea were now constantly exposed, and an
enormous quantity of shells and fish in a decaying state, which had been
thrown there by the waves, or suddenly laid dry during the earthquake,
attested the recent date of the occurrence. The whole coast was strewed
with uprooted trees.<a name="FNanchor_624" id="FNanchor_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a></p>

<p><i>Chili&mdash;Conception</i>, 1835.&mdash;Fortunately we have a still more detailed
account of the geographical changes produced in the same country on
the 20th of February, 1835. An earthquake was then felt at all places
between Copiapo and Chiloe, from north to south, and from Mendoza
to Juan Fernandez, from east to west. "Vessels," says Mr. Caldcleugh,
"navigating the Pacific, within 100 miles of the coast, experienced the
shock with considerable force."<a name="FNanchor_625" id="FNanchor_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a> Conception, Talcahuano, Chillan, and
other towns were thrown down. From the account of Captain Fitz Roy,
R. N., who was then employed in surveying the coast, we learn that after
the shock the sea retired in the Bay of Conception, and the vessels
grounded, even those which had been lying in seven fathoms water: all
the shoals were visible, and soon afterwards a wave rushed in and then
retreated, and was followed by two other waves. The vertical height of
these waves does not appear to have been much greater than from sixteen
to twenty feet, although they rose to much greater heights when
they broke upon a sloping beach.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 69.</span><a name="f69" id="f69"></a>
<img src="images/f69.png" width="500" height="960" alt="Map of Chilian Andes." title="" /></div>

<p>According to Mr. Caldcleugh and Mr. Darwin, the whole volcanic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">454</a></span>
chain of the Chilian Andes, a range 150 miles in length, was in a state
of unusual activity, both during the shocks and for some time preceding
and after the convulsion, and lava was seen to flow from the crater of
Osorno. (See Map, <a href="#f69">fig. 69</a>.) The island of Juan Fernandez, distant
365 geographical miles from Chili, was violently shaken at the same
time, and devastated by a great wave. A submarine volcano broke out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_455" id="Page_455">455</a></span>
there near Bacalao Head, about a mile from the shore, in sixty-nine
fathoms water, and illumined the whole island during the night.<a name="FNanchor_626" id="FNanchor_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a></p>

<p>"At Conception," says Captain Fitz Roy, "the earth opened and
closed rapidly in numerous places. The direction of the cracks was not
uniform, though generally from southeast to northwest. The earth was
not quiet for three days after the great shock, and more than 300
shocks were counted between the 20th February and the 4th of March.
The loose earth of the valley of the Biobio was everywhere parted from
the solid rocks which bound the plain, there being an opening between
them from an inch to a foot in width.</p>

<p>"For some days after the 20th of February, the sea at Talcahuano,"
says Captain Fitz Roy, "did not rise to the usual marks by four or five
feet vertically. When walking on the shore, even at high water, beds
of dead mussels, numerous chitons, and limpets, and withered seaweed,
still adhering, though lifeless, to the rocks on which they had
lived, everywhere met the eye." But this difference in the relative level
of the land and sea gradually diminished, till in the middle of April the
water rose again to within two feet of the former high-water mark. It
might be supposed that these changes of level merely indicated a temporary
disturbance in the set of the currents or in the height of the tides
at Talcahuano; but, on considering what occurred in the neighboring
island of Santa Maria, Captain Fitz Roy concluded that the land had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_456" id="Page_456">456</a></span>
been raised four or five feet in February, and that it had returned in
April to within two or three feet of its former level.</p>

<p>Santa Maria, the island just alluded to, is about seven miles long and
two broad, and about twenty-five miles southwest of Conception. (See
Map, <a href="#f70">fig. 70</a>.) The phenomena observed there are most important. "It
appeared," says Captain Fitz Roy, who visited Santa Maria twice, the
first time at the end of March, and afterwards in the beginning of April,
"that the southern extremity of the island had been raised eight feet,
the middle nine, and the northern end upwards of ten feet. On steep
rocks, where vertical measures could be correctly taken, beds of dead
mussels were found ten feet above high-water mark. One foot lower
than the highest bed of mussels, a few limpets and chitons were seen
adhering to the rock where they had grown. Two feet lower than the
same, dead mussels, chitons, and limpets were abundant.</p>

<p>"An extensive rocky flat lies around the northern parts of Santa
Maria. Before the earthquake this flat was covered by the sea, some
projecting rocks only showing themselves. Now, the whole flat is exposed,
and square acres of it are covered with dead shell-fish, the stench
arising from which is abominable. By this elevation of the land the
southern port of Santa Maria has been almost destroyed; little shelter
remaining there, and very bad landing." The surrounding sea is also
stated to have become shallower in exactly the same proportion as the
land had risen; the soundings having diminished a fathom and a half
everywhere around the island.</p>

<p>At Tubal, also, to the southeast of Santa Maria, the land was raised six
feet, at Mocha two feet, but no elevation could be ascertained at Valdivia.</p>

<p>Among other effects of the catastrophe, it is stated that cattle standing
on a steep slope, near the shore, were rolled down into the sea, and
many others were washed off by the great wave from low land and
drowned.<a name="FNanchor_627" id="FNanchor_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a></p>

<p>In November of the same year (1835), Conception was shaken by
a severe earthquake, and on the same day Osorno, at the distance of
400 miles, renewed its activity. These facts prove not only the connection
of earthquakes with volcanic eruptions in this region, but also the
vast extent of the subterranean areas over which the disturbing cause
acts simultaneously.</p>

<p><i>Ischia</i>, 1828.&mdash;On the 2d of February the whole island of Ischia
was shaken by an earthquake, and in the October following I found all
the houses in Casamicciol still without their roofs. On the sides of a
ravine between that town and Forio, I saw masses of greenish tuff
which had been thrown down. The hot-spring of Rita, which was
nearest the centre of the movement, was ascertained by M. Covelli to
have increased in temperature, showing, as he observes, that the explosion
took place below the reservoirs which heat the thermal waters.<a name="FNanchor_628" id="FNanchor_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_457" id="Page_457">457</a></span>
<i>Bogota</i>, 1827.&mdash;On the 16th of November, 1827, the plain of Bogota,
in New Granada, or Colombia, was convulsed by an earthquake, and a
great number of towns were thrown down. Torrents of rain swelled
the Magdalena, sweeping along vast quantities of mud and other substances,
which emitted a sulphurous vapor and destroyed the fish.
Popayan, which is distant 200 geographical miles S. S. W. of Bogota,
suffered greatly. Wide crevices appeared in the road of Guanacas,
leaving no doubt that the whole of the Cordilleras sustained a powerful
shock. Other fissures opened near Costa, in the plains of Bogota, into
which the river Tunza immediately began to flow.<a name="FNanchor_629" id="FNanchor_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a> It is worthy of
remark, that in all such cases the ancient gravel bed of a river is deserted
and a new one formed at a lower level; so that a want of relation
in the position of alluvial beds of the existing water-courses may
be no test of the high antiquity of such deposits, at least in countries
habitually convulsed by earthquakes. Extraordinary rains accompanied
the shocks before mentioned; and two volcanoes are said to have been
in eruption in the mountain-chain nearest to Bogota.</p>

<p><i>Chili</i>, 1822.&mdash;On the 19th of November, 1822, the coast of Chili
was visited by a most destructive earthquake. The shock was felt simultaneously
throughout a space of 1200 miles from north to south.
St. Jago, Valparaiso, and some other places, were greatly injured.
When the district round Valparaiso was examined on the morning after
the shock, it was found that the coast for a considerable distance was
raised above its former level.<a name="FNanchor_630" id="FNanchor_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a> At Valparaiso the elevation was three
feet, and at Quintero about four feet. Part of the bed of the sea, says
Mrs. Graham, remained bare and dry at high water, "with beds of
oysters, mussels, and other shells adhering to the rocks on which they
grew, the fish being all dead, and exhaling most offensive effluvia.<a name="FNanchor_631" id="FNanchor_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a></p>

<p>An old wreck of a ship, which before could not be approached,
became accessible from the land, although its distance from the original
sea-shore had not altered. It was observed that the water-course of a
mill, at the distance of about a mile from the sea, gained a fall of fourteen
inches, in little more than one hundred yards; and from this fact
it is inferred that the rise in some parts of the inland country was far
more considerable than on the borders of the ocean.<a name="FNanchor_632" id="FNanchor_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a> Part of the coast
thus elevated consisted of granite, in which parallel fissures were caused,
some of which were traced for a mile and a half inland. Cones of earth
about four feet high were thrown up in several districts, by the forcing
up of water mixed with sand through funnel-shaped hollows,&mdash;a phenomenon
very common in Calabria, and the explanation of which will hereafter
be considered. Those houses in Chili of which the foundations
were on rock were less damaged than such as were built on alluvial
soil.</p>

<p>Mr. Cruickshanks, an English botanist, who resided in the country
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">458</a></span>
during the earthquake, has informed me that some rocks of greenstone
at Quintero, a few hundred yards from the beach, which had always
been under water till the shock of 1822, have since been uncovered
when the tide is at half-ebb: and he states that, after the earthquake,
it was the general belief of the fishermen and inhabitants of the Chilian
coast, <i>not</i> that the land had risen, but that the ocean had permanently
retreated.</p>

<p>Dr. Meyen, a Prussian traveller, who visited Valparaiso in 1831, says
that on examining the rocks both north and south of the town, nine years
after the event, he found, in corroboration of Mrs. Graham's account,
that remains of animals and sea-weed, the <i>Lessonia</i> of Bory de St. Vincent,
which has a firm ligneous stem, still adhered to those rocks which
in 1822 had been elevated above high-water mark.<a name="FNanchor_633" id="FNanchor_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a> According to the
same author, the whole coast of Central Chili was raised about four feet,
and banks of marine shells were laid dry on many parts of the coast.
He observed similar banks, elevated at unknown periods, in several
places, especially at Copiapo, where the species all agree with those now
living in the ocean. Mr. Freyer also, who resided some years in South
America, has confirmed these statements;<a name="FNanchor_634" id="FNanchor_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a> and Mr. Darwin obtained
evidence that the remains of an ancient wall, formerly washed by the
sea, and now 11&frac12; feet above high-water mark, acquired several feet of
this additional elevation during the earthquake of 1822.<a name="FNanchor_635" id="FNanchor_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a></p>

<p>The shocks continued up to the end of September, 1823; even then,
forty-eight hours seldom passed without one, and sometimes two or
three were felt during twenty-four hours. Mrs. Graham observed, after
the earthquake of 1822, that besides a beach newly raised above highwater
mark, there were several older elevated lines of beach, one above
the other, consisting of shingle mixed with shells extending in a parallel
direction to the shore, to the height of fifty feet above the sea.<a name="FNanchor_636" id="FNanchor_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a></p>

<p><i>Extent of country elevated.</i>&mdash;By some observers it has been supposed
that the whole country from the foot of the Andes to a great distance
under the sea was upraised in 1822, the greatest rise being at the distance
of about two miles from the shore. "The rise upon the coast was
from two to four feet:&mdash;at the distance of a mile inland it must have
been from five to six or seven feet."<a name="FNanchor_637" id="FNanchor_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a> It has also been conjectured by
the same eye-witnesses to the convulsion, that the area over which this
permanent alteration of level extended may have been equal to 100,000
square miles. Although the increased fall of certain water-courses may
have afforded some ground for this conjecture, it must be considered as
very hypothetical, and the estimate may have exceeded or greatly fallen
short of the truth. It may nevertheless be useful to reflect on the enormous
amount of change which this single convulsion occasioned, if the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">459</a></span>
extent of country moved upward really amounted to 100,000 square
miles,&mdash;an extent just equal to half the area of France, or about five-sixths
of the area of Great Britain and Ireland. If we suppose the
elevation to have been only three feet on an average, it will be seen that
the mass of rock added to the continent of America by the movement,
or, in other words, the mass previously below the level of the sea, and
after the shocks permanently above it, must have contained fifty-seven
cubic miles in bulk; which would be sufficient to form a conical mountain
two miles high (or about as high as Etna), with a circumference at
the base of nearly thirty-three miles. We may take the mean specific
gravity of the rock at 2&middot;655,&mdash;a fair average, and a convenient one in
such computations, because at such a rate a cubic yard weighs two tons.
Then, assuming the great pyramid of Egypt, if solid, to weigh, in accordance
with an estimate before given, six million tons, we may state the
rock added to the continent by the Chilian earthquake to have more than
equalled 100,000 pyramids.</p>

<p>But it must always be borne in mind that the weight of rock here alluded
to constituted but an insignificant part of the whole amount which
the volcanic forces had to overcome. The whole thickness of rock between
the surface of Chili and the subterranean foci of volcanic action
may be many miles or leagues deep. Say that the thickness was only
two miles, even then the mass which changed place and rose three feet
being 200,000 cubic miles in volume, must have exceeded in weight
363 million pyramids.</p>

<p>It may be instructing to consider these results in connection with
others already obtained from a different source, and to compare the
working of two antagonistic forces&mdash;the levelling power of running
water, and the expansive energy of subterranean heat. How long, it
may be asked, would the Ganges require, according to data before explained
(p. 283), to transport to the sea a quantity of solid matter equal
to that which may have been added to the land by the Chilian earthquake?
The discharge of mud in one year by the Ganges was estimated
at 20,000 million cubic feet. According to that estimate it would
require about four centuries (or 418 years) before the river could bear
down from the continent into the sea a mass equal to that gained by the
Chilian earthquake. In about half that time, perhaps, the united waters
of the Ganges and Burrampooter might accomplish the operation.</p>

<p><i>Cutch</i>, 1819.&mdash;A violent earthquake occurred at Cutch, in the delta
of the Indus, on the 16th of June, 1819. (See Map, <a href="#f71">fig. 71</a>.) The
principal town, Bhooj, was converted into a heap of ruins, and its stone
buildings were thrown down. The movement was felt over an area
having a radius of 1000 miles from Bhooj, and extending to Kbatmandoo,
Calcutta, and Pondicherry.<a name="FNanchor_638" id="FNanchor_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> The vibrations were felt in Northwest
India, at a distance of 800 miles, after an interval of about fifteen
minutes after the earthquake at Bhooj. At Ahmedabad the great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">460</a></span>
mosque, erected by Sultan Ahmed nearly 450 years before, fell to the
ground, attesting how long a period had elapsed since a shock of similar
violence had visited that point. At Anjar, the fort, with its tower
and guns, was hurled to the ground in one common mass of ruin. The
shocks continued until the 20th; when, thirty miles northwest from
Bhooj, the volcano called Denodur is said by some to have sent forth
flames, but Capt. Grant was unable to authenticate this statement.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 71.</span><a name="f71" id="f71"></a><img src="images/f71.png" width="600" height="498" alt="Map of the delta of the Indus,." title="" />
</div>

<p><i>Subsidence in the delta of the Indus.</i>&mdash;Although the ruin of towns was
great, the face of nature in the inland country, says Captain Macmurdo,
was not visibly altered. In the hills some large masses only of rock
and soil were detached from the precipices; but the eastern and almost
deserted channel of the Indus, which bounds the province of Cutch, was
greatly changed. This estuary, or inlet of the sea, was, before the
earthquake, fordable at Luckput, being only about a foot deep when
the tide was at ebb, and at flood-tide never more than six feet; but it
was deepened at the fort of Luckput, after the shock, to more than
<i>eighteen feet at low water</i>.<a name="FNanchor_639" id="FNanchor_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a> On sounding other parts of the channel, it
was found, that where previously the depth of the water at flood never
exceeded one or two feet, it had become from four to ten feet deep.
By these and other remarkable changes of level, a part of the inland
navigation of that country, which had been closed for centuries, became
again practicable.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">461</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 72.</span><a name="f72" id="f72"></a><img src="images/f72.jpg" width="550" height="400" alt="Fort of Sindree, on the eastern branch of the Indus." title="" />

<p class="center2">Fort of Sindree, on the eastern branch of the Indus, before it was submerged by the earthquake
of 1819, from a sketch of Capt. Grindlay, made in 1808.</p></div>

<p><i>Fort and village submerged.</i><a name="FNanchor_640" id="FNanchor_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a>&mdash;The fort and village of Sindree, on the
eastern arm of the Indus, above Luckput, are stated by the same writer
to have been overflowed; and, after the shock, the tops of the houses
and wall were alone to be seen above the water, for the houses, although
submerged, were not cast down. Had they been situated, therefore, in
the interior, where so many forts were levelled to the ground, their site
would, perhaps, have been regarded as having remained comparatively
unmoved. Hence we may suspect that great permanent upheavings
and depressions of soil may be the result of earthquakes, without the
inhabitants being in the least degree conscious of any change of level.</p>

<p>A more recent survey of Cutch, by Sir A. Burnes, who was not in
communication with Capt. Macmurdo, confirms the facts above enumerated,
and adds many important details.<a name="FNanchor_641" id="FNanchor_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> That officer examined the
delta of the Indus in 1826 and 1828, and from his account it appears
that, when Sindree subsided in June, 1819, the sea flowed in by the
eastern mouth of the Indus, and in a few hours converted a tract of
land, 2000 square miles in area, into an inland sea, or lagoon. Neither
the rush of the sea into this new depression, nor the movement of the
earthquake, threw down entirely the small fort of Sindree, one of the
four towers, the northwestern, still continuing to stand; and, the day after
the earthquake, the inhabitants who had ascended to the top of this
tower, saved themselves in boats.<a name="FNanchor_642" id="FNanchor_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">462</a></span>
<i>Elevation of the Ullah Bund.</i>&mdash;Immediately after the shock, the inhabitants
of Sindree saw, at the distance of five miles and a half from
their village, a long elevated mound, where previously there had been a
low and perfectly level plain. (See Map, <a href="#f71">fig. 71</a>.) To this uplifted
tract they gave the name of "Ullah Bund," or the "Mound of God,"
to distinguish it from several artificial dams previously thrown across
the eastern arm of the Indus.</p>

<p><i>Extent of country raised.</i>&mdash;It has been ascertained that this new-raised
country is <i>upwards of fifty miles</i> in length from east to west,
running parallel to that line of subsidence before mentioned, which
caused the grounds around Sindree to be flooded. The range of this
elevation extends from Puchum Island towards Gharee; its breadth
from north to south is conjectured to be in some parts <i>sixteen miles</i>, and
its greatest ascertained height above the original level of the delta is
ten feet,&mdash;an elevation which appears to the eye to be very uniform
throughout.</p>

<p>For several years after the convulsion of 1819, the course of the Indus
was very unsettled, and at length, in 1826, the river threw a vast
body of water into its eastern arm, that called the Phurraun, above
Sindree; and forcing its way in a more direct course to the sea, burst
through all the artificial dams which had been thrown across its channel,
and at length cut right through the "Ullah Bund," whereby a
natural section was obtained. In the perpendicular cliffs thus laid open
Sir A. Burnes found that the upraised lands consisted of clay filled with
shells. The new channel of the river where it intersected the "bund"
was eighteen feet deep, and forty yards in width; but in 1828 the
channel was still farther enlarged. The Indus, when it first opened this
new passage, threw such a body of water into the new mere, or salt
lagoon, of Sindree, that it became fresh for many months; but it had
recovered its saltness in 1828, when the supply of river-water was less
copious, and finally it became more salt than the sea, in consequence, as
the natives suggested to Sir A. Burnes, of the saline particles with
which the "Runn of Cutch" is impregnated.</p>

<p>In 1828 Sir A. Burnes went in a boat to the ruins of Sindree, where
a single remaining tower was seen in the midst of a wide expanse of sea.
The tops of the ruined walls still rose two or three feet above the level
of the water; and standing on one of these, he could behold nothing in
the horizon but water, except in one direction, where a blue streak of
land to the north indicated the Ullah Bund. This scene presents to the
imagination a lively picture of the revolutions now in progress on the
earth&mdash;a waste of waters where a few years before all was land, and
the only land visible consisting of ground uplifted by a recent earthquake.</p>

<p>Ten years after the visit of Sir A. Burnes above alluded to, my friend,
Captain Grant, F. G. S., of the Bombay Engineers, had the kindness
to send at my request a native surveyor to make a plan of Sindree and
Ullah Bund, in March, 1838. From his description it appears that, at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">463</a></span>
that season, the driest of the whole year, he found the channel traversing
the Bund to be 100 yards wide, without water, and incrusted with
salt. He was told that it has now only four or five feet of water in it
after rains. The sides or banks were nearly perpendicular, and nine
feet in height. The lagoon has diminished both in area and depth, and
part near the fort was dry land. The annexed drawing, made by Captain
Grant from the surveyor's plan, shows the appearance of the fort
in the midst of the lake, as seen in 1838 from the west, or from the
same point as that from which Captain Grindlay's sketch (see <a href="#f72">fig. 72</a>)
was taken in 1808, before the earthquake.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 73.</span><a name="f73" id="f73"></a><img src="images/f73.jpg" width="450" height="272" alt="View of the Fort of Sindree." title="" />

<p class="center2">View of the Fort of Sindree, from the west, in March, 1838.</p></div>

<p>The Runn of Cutch is a flat region of a very peculiar character, and no
less than 7000 square miles in area: a greater superficial extent than
Yorkshire, or about one-fourth the area of Ireland. It is not a desert
of moving sand, nor a marsh, but evidently the dried-up bed of an inland
sea, which for a great part of every year has a hard and dry bottom
uncovered by weeds or grass, and only supporting here and there a
few tamarisks. But during the monsoons, when the sea runs high, the
salt-water driven up from the Gulf of Cutch and the creeks at Luckput
overflows a large part of the Runn, especially after rains, when the soaked
ground permits the sea-water to spread rapidly. The Runn is also liable
to be overflowed occasionally in some parts by river-water: and it is remarkable
that the only portion which was ever highly cultivated (that
anciently called Sayra) is now permanently submerged. The surface of
the Runn is sometimes incrusted with salt about an inch in depth, in consequence
of the evaporation of the sea-water. Islands rise up in some parts
of the waste, and the boundary lands form bays and promontories. The
natives have various traditions respecting the former separation of Cutch
and Sinde by a bay of the sea, and the drying up of the district called
the Runn. But these tales, besides the usual uncertainty of oral tradition,
are farther obscured by mythological fictions. The conversion of
the Runn into land is chiefly ascribed to the miraculous powers of a Hindoo
saint, by name Damorath (or Dhoorunnath), who had previously done
penance for twelve years on the summit of Denodur hill. Captain Grant
infers, on various grounds, that this saint flourished about the eleventh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">464</a></span>
or twelfth century of our era. In proof of the drying up of the Runn,
some towns far inland are still pointed out as having once been ancient
ports. It has, moreover, been always said that ships were wrecked and
engulphed by the great catastrophe; and in the jets of black muddy
water thrown out of fissures in that region, in 1819, there were cast up
numerous pieces of wrought-iron and ship nails.<a name="FNanchor_643" id="FNanchor_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> Cones of sand six or
eight feet in height were at the same time thrown up on these lands.<a name="FNanchor_644" id="FNanchor_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a></p>

<p>We must not conclude without alluding to a <i>moral</i> phenomenon
connected with this tremendous catastrophe, which we regard as highly
deserving the attention of geologists. It is stated by Sir A. Burnes, that
"these wonderful events passed <i>unheeded</i> by the inhabitants of Cutch;"
for the region convulsed, though once fertile, had for a long period been
reduced to sterility by want of irrigation, so that the natives were indifferent
as to its fate. Now it is to this profound apathy which all but
highly civilized nations feel, in regard to physical events not having an
immediate influence on their worldly fortunes, that we must ascribe the
extraordinary dearth of historical information concerning changes of the
earth's surface, which modern observations show to be by no means of
rare occurrence in the ordinary course of nature.</p>

<p>Since the above account was written, a description has been published
of more recent geographical changes in the district of Cutch, near the
mouth of the Koree, or eastern branch of the Indus, which happened
in June, 1845. A large area seems to have subsided, and the Sindree
lake had become a salt marsh.<a name="FNanchor_645" id="FNanchor_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a></p>

<p><i>Island of Sumbawa</i>, 1815.&mdash;In April, 1815, one of the most frightful
eruptions recorded in history occurred in the province of Tomboro, in the
island of Sumbawa (see Map, <a href="#f39">fig. 39</a>, p. 351), about 200 miles from
the eastern extremity of Java. In April of the year preceding the
volcano had been observed in a state of considerable activity, ashes having
fallen upon the decks of vessels which sailed past the coast.<a name="FNanchor_646" id="FNanchor_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> The
eruption of 1815 began on the 5th of April, but was most violent on the
11th and 12th, and did not entirely cease till July. The sound of the
explosions was heard in Sumatra, at the distance of 970 geographical
miles in a direct line; and at Ternate, in an opposite direction, at the
distance of 720 miles. Out of a population of 12,000, in the province
of Tomboro, only twenty-six individuals survived. Violent whirlwinds
carried up men, horses, cattle, and whatever else came within their influence
into the air; tore up the largest trees by the roots, and covered the
whole sea with floating timber.<a name="FNanchor_647" id="FNanchor_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> Great tracts of land were covered by
lava, several streams of which, issuing from the crater of the Tomboro
mountain, reached the sea: So heavy was the fall of ashes, that they
broke into the Resident's house at Bima, forty miles east of the volcano,
and rendered it as well as many other dwellings in the town uninhabitable.
On the side of Java the ashes were carried to the distance of 300
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">465</a></span>
miles, and 217 towards Celebes, in sufficient quantity to darken the air.
The floating cinders to the westward of Sumatra formed, on the 12th of
April, a mass two feet thick, and several miles in extent, through which
ships with difficulty forced their way.</p>

<p>The darkness occasioned in the daytime by the ashes in Java was so
profound, that nothing equal to it was ever witnessed in the darkest
night. Although this volcanic dust when it fell was an impalpable
powder, it was of considerable weight when compressed, a pint of it
weighing twelve ounces and three quarters. "Some of the finest particles,"
says Mr. Crawfurd, "were transported to the islands of Amboyna
and Banda, which last is about 800 miles east from the site of the volcano,
although the southeast monsoon was then at its height." They
must have been projected, therefore, into the upper regions of the
atmosphere, where a counter-current prevailed.</p>

<p>Along the sea-coast of Sumbawa and the adjacent isles, the sea rose
suddenly to the height of from two to twelve feet, a great wave rushing
up the estuaries, and then suddenly subsiding. Although the wind at
Bima was still during the whole time, the sea rolled in upon the shore,
and filled the lower parts of the houses with water a foot deep. Every
prow and boat was forced from the anchorage, and driven on shore.</p>

<p>The town called Tomboro, on the west side of Sumbawa, was overflowed
by the sea, which encroached upon the shore so that the water
remained permanently eighteen feet deep in places where there was land
before. Here we may observe, that the amount of subsidence of land
was apparent, in spite of the ashes, which would naturally have caused
the limits of the coast to be extended.</p>

<p>The area over which tremulous noises and other volcanic effects extended,
was 1000 English miles in circumference, including the whole
of the Molucca Islands, Java, a considerable portion of Celebes, Sumatra,
and Borneo. In the island of Amboyna, in the same month and
year, the ground opened, threw out water, and then closed again.<a name="FNanchor_648" id="FNanchor_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, I may remind the reader, that but for the accidental
presence of Sir Stamford Raffles, then Governor of Java, we should
scarcely have heard in Europe of this tremendous catastrophe. He
required all the residents in the various districts under his authority to
send in a statement of the circumstances which occurred within their own
knowledge; but, valuable as were their communications, they are often
calculated to excite rather than to satisfy the curiosity of the geologist.
They mention that similar effects, though in a less degree, had, about
seven years before, accompanied an eruption of Carang Assam, a volcano
in the island of Bali, west of Sumatra; but no particulars of that great
catastrophe are recorded.<a name="FNanchor_649" id="FNanchor_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a></p>

<p><i>Caraccas</i>, 1812.&mdash;On the 26th of March, 1812, several violent shocks
of an earthquake were felt in Caraccas. The surface undulated like a
boiling liquid, and terrific sounds were heard underground. The whole
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_466" id="Page_466">466</a></span>
city with its splendid churches was in an instant a heap of ruins, under
which 10,000 of the inhabitants were buried. On the 5th of April,
enormous rocks were detached from the mountains. It was believed
that the mountain Silla lost from 300 to 360 feet of its height by subsidence;
but this was an opinion not founded on any measurement. On
the 27th of April, a volcano in St. Vincent's threw out ashes; and, on
the 30th, lava flowed from its crater into the sea, while its explosions
were heard at a distance equal to that between Vesuvius and Switzerland,
the sound being transmitted, as Humboldt supposes, through the
ground. During the earthquake which destroyed Caraccas, an immense
quantity of water was thrown out at Valecillo, near Valencia, as also at
Porto Cabello, through openings in the earth; and in the Lake Maracaybo
the water sank. Humboldt observed that the Cordilleras, composed
of gneiss and mica slate, and the country immediately at their feet,
were more violently shaken than the plains.<a name="FNanchor_650" id="FNanchor_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a></p>

<p><i>South Carolina and New Madrid, Missouri</i>, 1811-12.&mdash;Previous to
the destruction of La Guayra and Caraccas, in 1812, earthquakes were
felt in South Carolina; and the shocks continued till those cities were
destroyed. The valley also of the Mississippi, from the village of New
Madrid to the mouth of the Ohio in one direction, and to the St. Francis
in another, was convulsed in such a degree as to create new lakes and
islands. It has been remarked by Humboldt in his Cosmos, that the
earthquake of New Madrid presents one of the few examples on record
of the incessant quaking of the ground for several successive months <i>far
from any volcano</i>. Flint, the geographer, who visited the country seven
years after the event, informs us, that a tract of many miles in extent,
near the Little Prairie, became covered with water three or four feet
deep; and when the water disappeared a stratum of sand was left in its
place. Large lakes of twenty miles in extent were formed in the course
of an hour, and others were drained. The grave-yard at New Madrid
was precipitated into the bed of the Mississippi; and it is stated that the
ground whereon the town is built, and the river-bank for fifteen miles
above, sank eight feet below their former level.<a name="FNanchor_651" id="FNanchor_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> The neighboring forest
presented for some years afterwards "a singular scene of confusion; the
trees standing inclined in every direction, and many having their trunks
and branches broken."<a name="FNanchor_652" id="FNanchor_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a></p>

<p>The inhabitants relate that the earth rose in great undulations; and
when these reached a certain fearful height, the soil burst, and vast volumes
of water, sand, and pit-coal were discharged as high as the tops
of the trees. Flint saw hundreds of these deep chasms remaining in an
alluvial soil, seven years after. The people in the country, although
inexperienced in such convulsions, had remarked that the chasms in the
earth were in a direction from S. W. to N. E.; and they accordingly
felled the tallest trees, and laying them at right angles to the chasms,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_467" id="Page_467">467</a></span>
stationed themselves upon them. By this invention, when chasms opened
more than once under these trees, several persons were prevented
from being swallowed up.<a name="FNanchor_653" id="FNanchor_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a> At one period during this earthquake, the
ground not far below New Madrid swelled up so as to arrest the Mississippi
in its course, and to cause a temporary reflux of its waves. The
motion of some of the shocks is described as having been horizontal, and
of others perpendicular; and the vertical movement is said to have been
much less desolating than the horizontal.</p>

<p>The above account has been reprinted exactly as it appeared in
former editions of this work, compiled from the authorities which I have
cited; but having more recently (March, 1846) had an opportunity
myself of visiting the disturbed region of the Mississippi, and conversing
with many eye-witnesses of the catastrophe, I am able to confirm
the truth of those statements, and to add some remarks on the present
face and features of the country. I skirted, as was before related (p.
270), part of the territory immediately west of New Madrid, called
"the sunk country," which was for the first time permanently submerged
during the earthquake of 1811-12. It is said to extend along
the course of the White Water and its tributaries for a distance of between
70 and 80 miles north and south, and 30 miles east and west. I
saw on its borders many full-grown trees still standing leafless, the bottoms
of their trunks several feet under water, and a still greater number
lying prostrate. An active vegetation of aquatic plants is already
beginning to fill up some of the shallows, and the sediment washed in
by occasional floods when the Mississippi rises to an extraordinary
height contributes to convert the sunk region into marsh and forest
land. Even on the dry ground along the confines of the submerged
area, I observed in some places that all the trees of prior date to 1811
were dead and leafless, though standing erect and entire. They are
supposed to have been killed by the loosening of their roots during the
repeated undulations which passed through the ground for three months
in succession.</p>

<p>Mr. Bringier, an experienced engineer of New Orleans, who was on
horseback near New Madrid when some of the severest shocks were experienced,
related to me (in 1846), that "as the waves advanced the
trees bent down, and the instant afterwards, while recovering their position,
they often met those of other trees similarly inclined, so that their
branches becoming interlocked, they were prevented from righting themselves
again. The transit of the wave through the woods was marked
by the crashing noise of countless boughs, first heard on one side and
then on the other. At the same time powerful jets of water, mixed
with sand, mud, and fragments of coaly matter, were cast up, endangering
the lives of both horse and rider."</p>

<p>I was curious, to ascertain whether any vestiges still remained of
these fountains of mud and water, and carefully examined between New
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">468</a></span>
Madrid and the Little Prairie several "sink holes," as they are termed.
They consist of cavities from 10 to 30 yards in width, and 20 feet or
more in depth, and are very conspicuous, interrupting the level surface
of a flat alluvial plain. I saw abundance of sand, which some of the
present inhabitants saw spouting from these deep holes, also fragments
of decayed wood and black bituminous shale, probably drifted down at
some former period in the main channel of the Mississippi, from the
coal-fields farther north. I also found numerous rents in the soil left
by the earthquake, some of them still several feet wide, and a yard or
two in depth, although the action of rains, frost, and occasional inundations,
and especially the leaves of trees blown into them in countless
numbers every autumn, have done much to fill them up. I measured
the direction of some of the fissures, which usually varied from 10 to
45 degrees W. of north, and were often parallel to each other; I found,
however, a considerable diversity in their direction. Many of them are
traceable for half a mile and upwards, but they might easily be mistaken
for artificial trenches if resident settlers were not there to assure
us that within their recollection they were "as deep as wells." Fragments
of coaly shale were strewed along the edges of some of these
open fissures, together with white sand, in the same manner as round
the "sink holes."<a name="FNanchor_654" id="FNanchor_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a></p>

<p>Among other monuments of the changes wrought in 1811-12, I explored
the bed of the lake called Eulalie, near New Madrid, 300 yards
long by 100 yards in width, which was suddenly drained during the
earthquake. The parallel fissures by which the waters escaped are not
yet entirely closed, and all the trees growing on its bottom were at the
time of my visit less than 34 years old. They consisted of cotton-wood,
willows, and honey-locust, and other species, differing from those clothing
the surrounding higher grounds, which are more elevated by 12 or
15 feet. On them the hickory, the black and white oak, the gum and
other trees, many of them of ancient date, were flourishing.</p>

<p><i>Aleutian Islands</i>, 1806.&mdash;In the year 1806, a new island, in the form
of a peak, with some low conical hills upon it, is said to have risen from
the sea among the Aleutian Islands, east of Kamtschatka. According to
Langsdorf,<a name="FNanchor_655" id="FNanchor_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a> it was four geographical miles in circumference; and Von
Buch infers from its magnitude, and from its not having again subsided
below the level of the sea, that it did not consist merely of ejected matter,
but of a solid rock of trachyte upheaved.<a name="FNanchor_656" id="FNanchor_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a> Another extraordinary
eruption happened in the spring of the year 1814, in the sea near Unalaschka,
in the same archipelago. A new isle was then produced of
considerable size, and with a peak three thousand feet high, which remained
standing for a year afterwards, though with somewhat diminished
height.</p>

<p>Although it is not improbable that earthquakes accompanying these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">469</a></span>
tremendous eruptions may have heaved up part of the bed of the sea,
yet the circumstance of the islands not having disappeared like Sabrina
(see p. <a href="#Page_416">416</a>), may have arisen from the emission of lava. If Jorullo, for
example, in 1759, had risen from a shallow sea to the height of 1600
feet, instead of attaining that elevation above the Mexican plateau, the
massive current of basaltic lava which poured out from its crater would
have enabled it to withstand, for a long period, the action of a turbulent
sea.</p>

<p><i>Reflections on the earthquakes of the nineteenth century.</i>&mdash;We are now
about to pass on to the events of the eighteenth century; but before we
leave the consideration of those already enumerated, let us pause for a
moment, and reflect how many remarkable facts of geological interest
are afforded by the earthquakes above described, though they constitute
but a small part of the convulsions even of the last forty years. New
rocks have risen from the waters; new hot springs have burst out, and
the temperature of others has been raised; the coast of Chili has been
thrice permanently elevated; a considerable tract in the delta of the
Indus has sunk down, and some of its shallow channels have become
navigable; an adjoining part of the same district, upwards of fifty miles
in length and sixteen in breadth, has been raised about ten feet above its
former level; part of the great plain of the Mississippi, for a distance of
eighty miles in length by thirty in breadth, has sunk down several feet;
the town of Tomboro has been submerged, and twelve thousand of the
inhabitants of Sumbawa have been destroyed. Yet, with a knowledge
of these terrific catastrophes, witnessed during so brief a period by the
present generation, will the geologist declare with perfect composure
that the earth has at length settled into a state of repose? Will he
continue to assert that the changes of relative level of land and sea, so
common in former ages of the world, have now ceased? If, in the face
of so many striking facts, he persists in maintaining this favorite dogma,
it is in vain to hope that, by accumulating the proofs of similar convulsions
during a series of antecedent ages, we shall shake his tenacity of
purpose:&mdash;</p>

<h6>EARTHQUAKES OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.</h6>

<p><i>Quito</i>, 1797.&mdash;On the morning of February 4th, 1797, the volcano
of Tunguragua in Quito, and the surrounding district, for forty leagues
from south to north, and twenty leagues from west to east, experienced
an undulating movement, which lasted four minutes. The same shock
was felt over a tract of 170 leagues from south to north, from Piura to
Popayan; and 140 from west to east, from the sea to the river Napo.
In the smaller district first mentioned, where the movement was more
intense, every town was levelled to the ground; and Riobamba, Quero,
and other places, were buried under masses detached from the mountains.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">470</a></span>
At the foot of Tunguragua the earth was rent open in several
places; and streams of water and fetid mud, called "moya," poured
out, overflowing and wasting every thing. In valleys 1000 feet broad,
the water of these floods reached to the height of 600 feet; and the
mud deposit barred up the course of the river, so as to form lakes,
which in some places continued for more than eighty days. Flames and
suffocating vapors escaped from the lake Quilotoa, and killed all the
cattle on its shores. The shocks continued all February and March;
and on the 5th of April they recurred with almost as much violence as
at first. We are told that the form of the surface in the district most
shaken was entirely altered, but no exact measurements are given
whereby we may estimate the degree of elevation or subsidence.<a name="FNanchor_657" id="FNanchor_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a> Indeed
it would be difficult, except in the immediate neighborhood of the
sea, to obtain any certain standard of comparison if the levels were really
as much altered as the narrations imply.</p>

<p><i>Cumana</i>, 1797.&mdash;In the same year, on the 14th of December, the
small Antilles experienced subterranean movements, and four-fifths of
the town of Cumana was shaken down by a vertical shock. The form
of the shoal of Mornerouge, at the mouth of the river Bourdones, was
changed by an upheaving of the ground.<a name="FNanchor_658" id="FNanchor_658"></a><a href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a></p>

<p><i>Canada&mdash;Quebec</i>, 1791.&mdash;We learn from Captain Bayfield's memoirs,
that earthquakes are very frequent on the shore of the estuary of the
St. Lawrence, of force sufficient at times to split walls and throw down
chimneys. Such were the effects experienced in December, 1721, in St.
Paul's Bay, about fifty miles N. E. from Quebec; and the inhabitants
say, that about every twenty-five years a violent earthquake returns,
which lasts forty days. In the History of Canada, it is stated that, in
1663, a tremendous convulsion lasted six months, extending from Quebec
to Tadeausac,&mdash;a distance of about 130 miles. The ice on the
river was broken up, and many landslips caused.<a name="FNanchor_659" id="FNanchor_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a></p>

<p><i>Caraccas</i>, 1790.&mdash;In the Caraccas, near where the Caura joins the
Orinoco, between the towns San Pedro de Alcantara and San Francisco
de Aripao, an earthquake, on St. Matthew's day 1790, caused a sinking
in of the granitic soil, and left a lake 800 yards in diameter, and from
eighty to one hundred in depth. It was a portion of the forest of Aripao
which subsided, and the trees remained green for several months
under water.<a name="FNanchor_660" id="FNanchor_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a></p>

<p><i>Sicily</i>, 1790.&mdash;On the 18th of March in the same year, at S. Maria
di Niscemi, some miles from Terranuova, near the south coast of Sicily,
the ground gradually sunk down for a circumference of three Italian
miles, during seven shocks; and, in one place, to the depth of thirty
feet. It continued to subside to the end of the month. Several fissures
sent forth sulphur, petroleum, steam, and hot water, and a stream of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">471</a></span>
mud, which flowed for two hours, and covered a space sixty feet long
and thirty broad. This happened far from both the ancient and modern
volcanic district, in a group of strata consisting chiefly of blue clay.<a name="FNanchor_661" id="FNanchor_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a></p>

<p><i>Java</i>, 1786.&mdash;About the year 1786, an earthquake was felt at intervals,
for the period of four months, in the neighborhood of Batur, in
Java, and an eruption followed. Various rents were formed, which
emitted a sulphurous vapor; separate tracts sunk away, and were
swallowed by the earth. Into one of these the rivulet Dotog entered,
and afterwards continued to follow a subterraneous course. The village
of Jampang was buried in the ground, with thirty-eight of its inhabitants,
who had not time to escape. We are indebted to Dr. Horsfield
for having verified the above-mentioned facts.<a name="FNanchor_662" id="FNanchor_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a></p>

<p><i>Calabria</i>, 1783.&mdash;Of the numerous earthquakes which have occurred
in different parts of the globe, during the last 100 years, that of Calabria,
in 1783, is almost the only one of which the geologist can be said
to have such a circumstantial account as to enable him fully to appreciate
the changes which this cause is capable of producing in the lapse
of ages. The shocks began in February, 1783, and lasted for nearly
four years, to the end of 1786. Neither in duration, nor in violence,
nor in the extent of territory moved, was this convulsion remarkable,
when contrasted with many experienced in other countries, both during
the last and present century; nor were the alterations which it occasioned
in the relative level of hill and valley, land and sea, so great as
those effected by some subterranean movements in South America, in
later times. The importance of the earthquake in question arises from
the circumstance, that Calabria is the only spot hitherto visited, both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">472</a></span>
during and after the convulsions, by men possessing sufficient leisure,
zeal, and scientific information, to enable them to collect and describe
with accuracy the physical facts which throw light on geological questions.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 74.</span><a name="f74" id="f74"></a>
<img src="images/f74.png" width="500" height="538" alt="Map of Calabria." title="" /></div>

<p><i>Authorities.</i>&mdash;Among the numerous authorities, Vivenzio, physician
to the king of Naples, transmitted to the court a regular statement of
his observations during the continuance of the shocks; and his narrative
is drawn up with care and clearness.<a name="FNanchor_663" id="FNanchor_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a> Francesco Antonio Grimaldi,
then secretary of war, visited the different provinces at the king's
command, and published a most detailed description of the permanent
changes in the surface.<a name="FNanchor_664" id="FNanchor_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a> He measured the length, breadth, and depth
of the different fissures and gulfs which opened, and ascertained their
number in many provinces. His comments, moreover, on the reports of
the inhabitants, and his explanations of their relations, are judicious and
instructive. Pignataro, a physician residing at Monteleone, a town
placed in the very centre of the convulsions, kept a register of the
shocks, distinguishing them into four classes, according to their degree
of violence. From his work, it appears that, in the year 1783, the
number was 949, of which 501 were shocks of the first degree of force;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">473</a></span>
and in the following year there were 151, of which 98 were of the first
magnitude.</p>

<p>Count Ippolito, also, and many others, wrote descriptions of the
earthquake; and the Royal Academy of Naples, not satisfied with these
and other observations, sent a deputation from their own body into Calabria,
before the shocks had ceased, who were accompanied by artists instructed
to illustrate by drawings the physical changes of the district,
and the state of ruined towns and edifices. Unfortunately these artists
were not very successful in their representations of the condition of the
country, particularly when they attempted to express, on a large scale,
the extraordinary revolutions which many of the great and minor river-courses
underwent. But many of the plates published by the Academy
are valuable; and as they are little known, I shall frequently avail myself
of them to illustrate the facts about to be described.<a name="FNanchor_665" id="FNanchor_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a></p>

<p>In addition to these Neapolitan sources of information, our countryman,
Sir William Hamilton, surveyed the district, not without some
personal risk, before the shocks had ceased; and his sketch, published
in the Philosophical Transactions, supplies many facts that would otherwise
have been lost. He has explained, in a rational manner, many
events which, as related in the language of some eye-witnesses, appeared
marvellous and incredible. Dolomieu also examined Calabria during
the catastrophe, and wrote an account of the earthquake, correcting a
mistake into which Hamilton had fallen, who supposed that a part of
the tract shaken had consisted of volcanic tuff. It is, indeed, a circumstance
which enhances the geological interest of the commotions which
so often modify the surface of Calabria, that they are confined to a
country where there are neither ancient nor modern rocks of volcanic
or trappean origin; so that at some future time, when the era of disturbance
shall have passed by, the cause of former revolutions will be
as latent as in parts of Great Britain now occupied exclusively by ancient
marine formations.</p>

<p><i>Extent of the area convulsed.</i>&mdash;The convulsion of the earth, sea, and
air extended over the whole of Calabria Ultra, the southeast part of
Calabria Citra, and across the sea to Messina and its environs; a district
lying between the 38th and 39th degrees of latitude. The concussion
was perceptible over a great part of Sicily, and as far north as Naples;
but the surface over which the shocks acted so forcibly as to excite
intense alarm did not generally exceed 500 square miles in area. The
soil of that part of Calabria is composed chiefly, like the southern part
of Sicily, of calcareo-argillaceous strata of great thickness, containing
marine shells. This clay is sometimes associated with beds of sand and
limestone. For the most part these formations resemble in appearance
and consistency the Subapennine marls, with their accompanying sands
and sandstones; and the whole group bears considerable resemblance,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">474</a></span>
in the yielding nature of its materials, to most of our tertiary deposits
in France and England. Chronologically considered, however, the Calabrian
formations are comparatively of modern date, often abounding in
fossil shells referable to species now living in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p>We learn from Vivencio, that on the 20th and 26th of March, 1783,
earthquakes occurred in the islands of Zante, Cephalonia, and St. Maura;
and in the last-mentioned island several public edifices and private
houses were overthrown, and many people destroyed.</p>

<p>If the city of Oppido, in Calabria Ultra, be taken as a centre, and
round that centre a circle be described, with a radius of twenty-two
miles, this space will comprehend the surface of the country which
suffered the greatest alteration, and where all the towns and villages
were destroyed. The first shock, of February 5th, 1783, threw down,
in two minutes, the greater part of the houses in all the cities, towns,
and villages, from the western flanks of the Apennines in Calabria Ultra
to Messina in Sicily, and convulsed the whole surface of the country.
Another occurred on the 28th of March, with almost equal violence.
The granitic chain which passes through Calabria from north to south,
and attains the height of many thousand feet, was shaken but slightly
by the first shock, but more rudely by some which followed.</p>

<p>Some writers have asserted that the wave-like movements which
were propagated through the recent strata, from west to east, became
very violent when they reached the point of junction with the granite,
as if a reaction was produced where the undulatory movement of the
soft strata was suddenly arrested by the more solid rocks. But the
statement of Dolomieu on this subject is most interesting, and perhaps,
in a geological point of view, the most important of all the observations
which are recorded.<a name="FNanchor_666" id="FNanchor_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a> The Apennines, he says, which consist in great
part of hard and solid granite, with some micaceous and argillaceous
schists, form bare mountains with steep sides, and exhibit marks of
great degradation. At their base newer strata are seen of sand and
clay, mingled with shells; a marine deposit containing such ingredients
as would result from the decomposition of granite. The surface of this
newer (<i>tertiary</i>) formation constitutes what is called the plain of Calabria&mdash;a
platform which is flat and level, except where intersected by
narrow valleys or ravines, which rivers and torrents have excavated
sometimes to the depth of six hundred feet. The sides of these ravines
are almost perpendicular; for the superior stratum, being bound together
by the roots of trees, prevents the formation of a sloping bank.
The usual effect of the earthquake, he continues, was to disconnect all
those masses which either had not sufficient bases for their bulk, or
which was supported only by lateral adherence. Hence it follows that
throughout almost the whole length of the chain, the soil which adhered
to the granite at the base of the mountains Caulone, Esope, Sagra, and

Aspramonte, slid over the solid and steeply inclined nucleus, and descended
somewhat lower, leaving almost uninterruptedly from St.
George to beyond St. Christina, a distance of from nine to ten miles, a
chasm between the solid granitic nucleus and the sandy soil. Many
lands slipping thus were carried to a considerable distance from their
former position, so as entirely to cover others; and disputes arose as to
whom the property which had thus shifted its place should belong.</p>

<p>From this account of Dolomieu we might anticipate, as the result of a
continuance of such earthquakes, first, a longitudinal valley following the
line of junction of the older and newer rocks; secondly, greater disturbance
in the newer strata near the point of contact than at a greater distance
from the mountains; phenomena very common in other parts of
Italy at the junction of the Apennine and Subapennine formations.</p>

<p>Mr. Mallet, in his valuable essay on the Dynamics of Earthquakes,<a name="FNanchor_667" id="FNanchor_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a>
offers the following explanation of the fact to which Dolomieu has called
attention. When a wave of elastic compression, of which he considers
the earth-wave to consist, passes abruptly from a body having an extremely
low elasticity, such as clay and gravel, into another like granite,
whose elasticity is remarkably high, it changes not only its velocity but
in part also its course, a portion being reflected and a portion refracted.
The wave being thus sent back again produces a shock in the opposite
direction, doing great damage to buildings on the surface by thus returning
upon itself. At the same time, the shocks are at once eased
when they get into the more elastic materials of the granitic mountains.</p>

<p>The surface of the country during the Calabrian earthquakes often
heaved like the billows of a swelling sea, which produced a swimming
in the head, like sea-sickness. It is particularly stated, in almost all the
accounts, that just before each shock the clouds appeared motionless;
and, although no explanation is offered of this phenomenon, it is obviously
the same as that observed in a ship at sea when it pitches violently.
The clouds seem arrested in their career as often as the vessel rises in a
direction contrary to their course; so that the Calabrians must have experienced
precisely the same motion on the land.</p>

<p>Trees, supported by their trunks, sometimes bent during the shocks
to the earth, and touched it with their tops. This is mentioned as a
well-known fact by Dolomieu; and he assures us that he was always
on his guard against the spirit of exaggeration in which the vulgar are
ever ready to indulge when relating these wonderful occurrences.</p>

<p>It is impossible to suppose that these waves, which are described in
Italy and other regions of earthquakes as passing along the solid surface
of the earth in a given direction like a billow on the sea, have any strict
analogy with the undulations of a fluid. They are doubtless the effects
of vibrations, radiating from some deep-seated point, each of which on
reaching the surface lifts up the ground, and then allows it again to subside.
As the distance between the source of the subterranean move<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">476</a></span>ment
and the surface must vary according to the outline of the country,
so the vibratory jar will reach different points in succession.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 75.</span><a name="f75" id="f75"></a><img src="images/f75.png" width="400" height="310" alt="Shifts in the stones of two obelisks in the Convent of St Bruno." title="" />

<p class="center2">Shifts in the stones of two obelisks in the Convent of St Bruno.</p></div>

<p>The Academicians relate that in some of the cities of Calabria effects
were produced seeming to indicate a whirling or vorticose movement.
Thus, for example, two obelisks (<a href="#f75">fig. 75</a>) placed at the extremities of a
magnificent fa&ccedil;ade in the convent of S. Bruno, in a small town called
Stefano del Bosco, were observed to have undergone a movement of a
singular kind. The shock which agitated the building is described as
having been horizontal and vorticose. The pedestal of each obelisk
remained in its original place; but the separate stones above were
turned partially round, and removed sometimes nine inches from their
position without falling.</p>

<p>It has been suggested by Mr. Darwin that this kind of displacement
may be due to a vibratory rather than a whirling motion;<a name="FNanchor_668" id="FNanchor_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a> and more
lately Mr. Mallet, in the paper already cited, has offered a very ingenious
solution of the problem. He refers the twisting simply to an elastic
wave, which has moved the pedestal forwards and back again, by an
alternate horizontal motion within narrow limits, and he has succeeded
in showing that a rectilinear movement in the ground may have sufficed
to cause an incumbent body to turn partially round upon its bed, provided
a certain relation exist between the position of the centre of gravity
of the body and its centre of adherence.<a name="FNanchor_669" id="FNanchor_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a></p>

<p>I shall now consider, in the first place, that class of physical changes
produced by the earthquake which are connected with alterations in the
relative level of the different parts of the land; and afterwards describe
those which are more immediately connected with the derangement of
the regular drainage of the country, and where the force of running water
co-operated with that of the earthquake.</p>

<p><i>Difficulty of ascertaining changes of level.</i>&mdash;In regard to alterations of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_477" id="Page_477">477</a></span>relative level, none of the accounts establish that they were on a considerable
scale; but it must always be remembered that, in proportion
to the area moved is the difficulty of proving that the general level has
undergone any change, unless the sea-coast happens to have participated
in the principal movement. Even then it is often impossible to determine
whether an elevation or depression even of several feet has occurred,
because there is nothing to attract notice in a band of shingle and sand
of unequal breadth above the level of the sea running parallel to a coast;
such bands generally marking the point reached by the waves during
spring tides, or the most violent tempests. The scientific investigator
has not sufficient topographical knowledge to discover whether the extent
of beach has diminished or increased; and he who has the necessary
local information, scarcely ever feels any interest in ascertaining the
amount of the rise or fall of the ground. Add to this the great difficulty
of making correct observations, in consequence of the enormous
waves which roll in upon a coast during an earthquake, and efface every
landmark near the shore.</p>

<p><i>Subsidence of the quay at Messina.</i>&mdash;It is evidently in seaports alone
that we can look for very accurate indications of slight changes of level;
and when we find them, we may presume that they would not be rare
at other points, if equal facilities of comparing relative altitudes were
afforded. Grimaldi states (and his account is confirmed by Hamilton and
others), that at Messina, in Sicily, the shore was rent; and the soil along
the port, which before the shock was perfectly level, was found afterwards
to be inclined towards the sea,&mdash;the sea itself near the "Banchina" becoming
deeper, and its bottom in several places disordered. The quay
also sunk down about fourteen inches below the level of the sea, and the
houses in its vicinity were much fissured. (<i>Phil. Trans.</i> 1783.)</p>

<p>Among various proofs of partial elevation and depression in the interior,
the Academicians mention, in their Survey, that the ground was
sometimes on the same level on both sides of new ravines and fissures,
but sometimes there had been a considerable shifting, either by the upheaving
of one side, or the subsidence of the other. Thus, on the sides
of long rents in the territory of Soriano, the stratified masses had altered
their relative position to the extent of from eight to fourteen palms (six
to ten and a half feet).</p>

<p><i>Polistena.</i>&mdash;Similar shifts in the strata are alluded to in the territory
of Polistena, where there appeared innumerable fissures in the earth.
One of these was of great length and depth; and in parts the level of
the corresponding sides was greatly changed. (See <a href="#f76">fig. 76</a>.)</p>

<p><i>Terranuova.</i>&mdash;In the town of Terranuova some houses were seen uplifted
above the common level, and others adjoining sunk down into the
earth. In several streets the soil appeared thrust up, and abutted
against the walls of houses: a large circular tower of solid masonry,
part of which had withstood the general destruction, was divided by a
vertical rent, and one side was upraised, and the foundations heaved out
of the ground. It was compared by the Academicians to a great tooth
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">478</a></span>
half extracted from the alveolus, with the upper part of the fangs exposed.
(See <a href="#f77">fig. 77</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 76.</span><a name="f76" id="f76"></a><img src="images/f76.jpg" width="500" height="355" alt="Deep fissure, near Polistena, caused by the earthquake of 1783." title="" />

<p class="center2">Deep fissure, near Polistena, caused by the earthquake of 1783.</p></div>

<p>Along the line of this shift, or "fault," as it would be termed technically
by miners, the walls were found to adhere firmly to each other, and
to fit so well, that the only signs of their having been disunited was the
want of correspondence in the courses of stone on either side of the rent.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 77.</span><a name="f77" id="f77"></a><img src="images/f77.png" width="500" height="447" alt="Shift or fault in the Round Tower of Terranuova in Calabria." title="" />

<p class="center2">Shift or "fault" in the Round Tower of Terranuova in Calabria, occasioned by the earthquake of
1783.</p></div>

<p>Dolomieu saw a stone well in the convent of the Augustins at Terranuova,
which had the appearance of having been driven out of the earth.
It resembled a small tower eight or nine feet in height, and a little inclined.
This effect, he says, was produced by the consolidation and
consequent sinking of the sandy soil in which the well was dug.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">479</a></span>
In some walls which had been thrown down, or violently shaken, in
Monteleone, the separate stones were parted from the mortar, so as to
leave an exact mould where they had rested; whereas in other cases
the mortar was ground to dust between the stones.</p>

<p>It appears that the wave-like motions often produced effects of the
most capricious kind. Thus, in some streets of Monteleone, every house
was thrown down but one; in others, all but two; and the buildings
which were spared were often scarcely in the least degree injured. In
many cities of Calabria, all the most solid buildings were thrown down,
while those which were slightly built escaped; but at Rosarno, as also
at Messina in Sicily, it was precisely the reverse, the massive edifices
being the only ones that stood.</p>

<p><i>Fissures.</i>&mdash;It appears evident that a great part of the rending and
fissuring of the ground was the effect of a violent motion from below
upwards; and in a multitude of cases where the rents and chasms
opened and closed alternately, we must suppose that the earth was by
turns heaved up, and then let fall again.<a name="FNanchor_670" id="FNanchor_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a> We may conceive the same
effect to be produced on a small scale, if, by some mechanical force, a
pavement composed of large flags of stone should be raised up, and
then allowed to fall suddenly, so as to resume its original position. If
any small pebbles happened to be lying on the line of contact of two
flags, they would fall into the opening when the pavement rose, and be
swallowed up, so that no trace of them would appear after the subsidence
of the stones. In the same manner, when the earth was upheaved,
large houses, trees, cattle, and men were engulfed in an instant
in chasms and fissures; and when the ground sank down again, the
earth closed upon them, so that no vestige of them was discoverable
on the surface. In many instances, individuals were swallowed up by
one shock, and then thrown out again alive, together with large jets of
water, by the shock which immediately succeeded.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 78.</span><a name="f78" id="f78"></a><img src="images/f78.png" width="500" height="370" alt="Fissures near Jerocarne, in Calabria, caused by the earthquake of 1783." title="" />

<p class="center2">Fissures near Jerocarne, in Calabria, caused by the earthquake of 1783.</p></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">480</a></span>
At Jerocarne, a country which, according to the Academicians, was
<i>lacerated</i> in a most extraordinary manner, the fissures ran in every direction,
"like cracks on a broken pane of glass" (see <a href="#f78">fig. 78</a>); and as a
great portion of them remained open after the shocks, it is very possible
that this country was permanently upraised. It was usual, as we learn
from Dolomieu, for the chasms and fissures throughout Calabria, to ran
parallel to the course of some pre-existing gorges in their neighborhood.</p>

<p><i>Houses engulfed.</i>&mdash;In the vicinity of Oppido, the central point from
which the earthquake diffused its violent movements, many houses were
swallowed up by the yawning earth, which closed immediately over
them. In the adjacent district, also, of Cannamaria four farm-houses,
several oil-stores, and some spacious dwelling-houses were so completely
engulfed in one chasm, that not a vestige of them was afterwards discernible.
The same phenomena occurred at Terranuova, S. Christina,
and Sinopoli. The Academicians state particularly, that when deep
abysses had opened in the argillaceous strata of Terranuova, and houses
had sunk into them, the sides of the chasms closed with such violence,
that, on excavating afterwards to recover articles of value, the workmen
found the contents and detached parts of the buildings jammed together
so as to become one compact mass. It is unnecessary to accumulate examples
of similar occurrences; but so many are well authenticated during
this earthquake in Calabria, that we may, without hesitation, yield assent
to the accounts of catastrophes of the same kind repeated again and
again in history, where whole towns are declared to have been engulfed,
and nothing but a pool of water or tract of sand left in their place.</p>

<p><i>Chasm formed near Oppido.</i>&mdash;On the sloping side of a hill near
Oppido a great chasm opened; and, although a large quantity of soil
was precipitated into the abyss, together with a considerable number
of olive-trees and part of a vineyard, a great gulf remained after the
shock, in the form of an amphitheatre, 500 feet long and 200 feet deep.
(See <a href="#f79">fig. 79</a>.)</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">481</a></span>
<i>Dimensions of new fissures and chasms.</i>&mdash;According to Grimaldi,
many fissures and chasms, formed by the first shock of February 5th,
were greatly widened, lengthened, and deepened by the violent convulsions
of March 28th. In the territory of San Fili this observer found a
new ravine, half a mile in length, two feet and a half broad, and twenty-five
feet deep; and another of similar dimensions in the territory of
Rosarno. A ravine <i>nearly a mile long</i>, 105 feet broad and thirty feet
deep, opened in the district of Plaisano, where, also, two gulfs were
caused&mdash;one in a place called Cerzulle, three-quarters of a mile long,
150 feet broad, and above <i>one hundred feet deep</i>; and another at La
Fortuna, nearly a quarter of a mile long, above thirty feet in breadth,
and no less than 225 feet deep.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 80.</span><a name="f80" id="f80"></a><img src="images/f80.png" width="550" height="384" alt="Chasm in the hill of St. Angelo, near Soriano, in Calabria, caused by the earthquake of 1783." title="" />

<p class="center2">Chasm in the hill of St. Angelo, near Soriano, in Calabria, caused by the earthquake of 1783.</p></div>

<p>In the district of Fosolano three gulfs opened: one of these measured
300 feet square, and above thirty feet deep; another was nearly
half a mile long, fifteen feet broad, and above thirty-feet deep; the
third was 750 feet square. Lastly, a calcareous mountain, called
Zefirio, at the southern extremity of the Italian peninsula, was cleft in
two for the length of nearly half a mile, and an irregular breadth of
many feet. Some of these chasms were in the form of a crescent.
The annexed cut (<a href="#f80">fig. 80</a>) represents one by no means remarkable for
its dimensions, which remained open by the side of a small pass over
the hill of St. Angelo, near Soriano. The small river Mesima is seen
in the foreground.</p>

<p><i>Formation of circular hollows and new lakes.</i>&mdash;In the report of the
Academy, we find that some plains were covered with circular hollows,
for the most part about the size of carriage-wheels, but often somewhat
larger or smaller. When filled with water to within a foot or two of
the surface, they appeared like wells; but, in general, they were filled
with dry sand, sometimes with a concave surface, and at other times
convex. (See <a href="#f81">fig. 81</a>.) On digging down, they found them to be funnel
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_482" id="Page_482">482</a></span>
shaped, and the moist loose sand in the centre marked the tube up
which the water spouted. The annexed cut (<a href="#f82">fig. 82</a>) represents a section
of one of these inverted cones when the water had disappeared, and
nothing but dry micaceous sand remained.</p>

<p class="center2">Section of one of the circular hollows formed in the plain of Rosarno.</p></div>

<p>A small circular pond of similar character was formed not far from
Polistena (see <a href="#f83">fig. 83</a>); and in the vicinity of Seminara, a lake was suddenly
caused by the opening of a great chasm, from the bottom of which
water issued. This lake was called Lago del Tolfilo. It extended 1785
feet in length, by 937 in breadth, and 52 in depth. The inhabitants,
dreading the miasma of this stagnant pool, endeavored, at great cost, to
drain it by canals, but without success, as it was fed by springs issuing
from the bottom of the deep chasm.</p>

<p>Vivenzio states, that near Sitizzano a valley was nearly filled up to a
level with the high grounds on each side, by the enormous masses detached
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_483" id="Page_483">483</a></span>
from the boundary hills, and cast down into the course of two
streams. By this barrier a lake was formed of great depth, about two
miles long and a mile broad. The same author mentions that, upon the
whole, there were fifty lakes occasioned during the convulsions: and he
assigns localities to all of these. The government surveyors enumerated
215 lakes; but they included in this number many small ponds.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 83.</span><a name="f83" id="f83"></a><img src="images/f83.jpg" width="450" height="348" alt="Circular pond near Polistena, in Calabria, caused by the earthquake in 1783." title="" />

<p class="center2">Circular pond near Polistena, in Calabria, caused by the earthquake in 1783.</p></div>

<p><i>Cones of sand thrown up.</i>&mdash;Many of the appearances exhibited in the
alluvial plains, such as springs spouting up their water like fountains at
the moment of the shock, have been supposed to indicate the alternate
rising and sinking of the ground. The first effect of the more violent
shocks was usually to dry up the rivers, but they immediately afterwards
overflowed their banks. In marshy places, an immense number of cones
of sand were thrown up. These appearances Hamilton explains, by
supposing that the first movement raised the fissured plain from below
upwards, so that the rivers and stagnant waters in bogs sank down, or
at least were not upraised with the soil. But when the ground returned
with violence to its former position, the water was thrown up in jets
through fissures.<a name="FNanchor_671" id="FNanchor_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a></p>

<p>The phenomenon, according to Mr. Mallet, may be simply an accident
contingent on the principal cause of disturbance, the rapid transit of the
earth-wave. "The sources," he says, "of copious springs usually lie in
flat plates or fissures filled with water, whether issuing from solid rock,
or from loose materials; now, if a vein, or thin flat cavity filled with
water, be in such a position that the plane of the plate of water or fissure
be transverse to the line of transit of the earth-wave, the effect of
the arrival of the earth-wave at the watery fissure will be, at the instant,
to compress its walls more or less together, and so squeeze out the water,
which will, for a moment, gush up at the spring-head like a fountain, and
again remain in repose after the transit of the wave."</p>

<p><i>Gradual closing in of fissures.</i>&mdash;Sir W. Hamilton was shown several
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_484" id="Page_484">484</a></span>
deep fissures in the vicinity of Mileto, which, although not one of them
was above a foot in breadth, had opened so wide during the earthquake
as to swallow an ox and nearly one hundred goats. The Academicians
also found, on their return through districts which they had passed at
the commencement of their tour, that many rents had, in that short
interval, gradually closed in, so that their width had diminished several
feet, and the opposite walls had sometimes nearly met. It is natural
that this should happen in argillaceous strata, while, in more solid rocks,
we may expect that fissures will remain open for ages. Should this be
ascertained to be a general fact in countries convulsed by earthquakes,
it may afford a satisfactory explanation of a common phenomenon in
mineral veins. Such veins often retain their full size so long as the rocks
consist of limestone, granite, or other indurated materials; but they contract
their dimensions, become mere threads, or are even entirely cut off,
where masses of an argillaceous nature are interposed. If we suppose
the filling up of fissures with metallic and other ingredients to be a process
requiring ages for its completion, it is obvious that the opposite walls
of rents, where strata consist of yielding materials, must collapse or
approach very near to each other before sufficient time is allowed for the
accretion of a large quantity of veinstone.</p>

<p><i>Thermal waters augmented.</i>&mdash;It is stated by Grimaldi, that the thermal
waters of St. Eufemia, in Terra di Amato, which first burst out during
the earthquake of 1638, acquired, in February, 1783, an augmentation
both in quantity and degree of heat. This fact appears to indicate
a connection between the heat of the interior and the fissures caused by
the Calabrian earthquakes, notwithstanding the absence of volcanic rocks,
either ancient or modern, in that district.</p>

<p><i>Bounding of detached masses into the air.</i>&mdash;The violence of the movement
of the ground upwards was singularly illustrated by what the
Academicians call the "sbalzo," or bounding into the air, to the height
of several yards, of masses slightly adhering to the surface. In some
towns a great part of the pavement stones were thrown up, and found
lying with their lower sides uppermost. In these cases, we must suppose
that they were propelled upwards by the momentum which they
had acquired; and that the adhesion of one end of the mass being greater
than that of the other, a rotatory motion had been communicated to them.
When the stone was projected to a sufficient height to perform somewhat
more than a quarter of a revolution in the air, it pitched down on
its edge, and fell with its lower side uppermost.</p>

<p><i>Effects of earthquakes on the excavations of valleys.</i>&mdash;The next class
of effects to be considered, are those more immediately connected with
the formation of valleys, in which the action of water was often combined
with that of the earthquake. The country agitated was composed, as
before stated, chiefly of argillaceous strata, intersected by deep narrow
valleys, sometimes from 500 to 600 feet deep. As the boundary cliffs
were in great part vertical, it will readily be conceived that, amidst the
various movements of the earth, the precipices overhanging rivers, being
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">485</a></span>
without support on one side, were often thrown down. We find, indeed,
that inundations produced by obstructions in river-courses are among
the most disastrous consequences of great earthquakes in all parts of the
world, for the alluvial plains in the bottoms of valleys are usually the
most fertile and well-peopled parts of the whole country; and whether
the site of a town is above or below a temporary barrier in the channel
of a river, it is exposed to injury by the waters either of a lake or flood.</p>

<p><i>Landslips.</i>&mdash;From each side of the deep valley or ravine of Terranuova
enormous masses of the adjoining flat country were detached, and
cast down into the course of the river, so as to give rise to great lakes.
Oaks, olive-trees, vineyards, and corn, were often seen growing at the
bottom of the ravine, as little injured as their former companions, which
still continued to flourish in the plain above, at least 500 feet higher,
and at the distance of about three-quarters of a mile. In one part of
this ravine was an enormous mass, 200 feet high and about 400 feet at
its base, which had been detached by some former earthquake. It is
well attested, that this mass travelled down the ravine nearly four miles,
having been put in motion by the earthquake of the 5th of February.
Hamilton, after examining the spot, declared that this phenomenon
might be accounted for by the declivity of the valley, the great abundance
of rain which fell, and the great weight of the alluvial matter
which pressed behind it. Dolomieu also alludes to the fresh impulse
derived from other masses falling, and pressing upon the rear of those
first set in motion.</p>

<p>The first account sent to Naples of the two great slides or landslips
above alluded to, which caused a great lake near Terranuova, was
couched in these words:&mdash;"Two mountains on the opposite sides of a
valley walked from their original position until they met in the middle
of the plain, and there joining together, they intercepted the course of
a river," &amp;c. The expressions here used resemble singularly those
applied to phenomena, probably very analogous, which are said to have
occurred at Fez, during the great Lisbon earthquake, as also in Jamaica
and Java at other periods.</p>

<p>Not far from Soriano, which was levelled to the ground by the great
shock of February, a small valley, containing a beautiful olive-grove,
called Fra Ramondo, underwent a most extraordinary revolution. Innumerable
fissures first traversed the river-plain in all directions, and
absorbed the water until the argillaceous substratum became soaked, so
that a great part of it was reduced to a state of fluid paste. Strange
alterations in the outline of the ground were the consequence, as the
soil to a great depth was easily moulded into any form. In addition to
this change, the ruins of the neighboring hills were precipitated into
the hollow; and while many olives were uprooted, others remained
growing on the fallen masses, and inclined at various angles (see <a href="#f84">fig. 84</a>).
The small river Caridi was entirely concealed for many days; and when
at length it reappeared, it had shaped for itself an entirely new channel.</p>

<p><i>Buildings transported entire to great distances.</i>&mdash;Near Seminara an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_486" id="Page_486">486</a></span>
extensive olive-ground and orchard were hurled to a distance of two
hundred feet, into a valley sixty feet in depth. At the same time a
deep chasm was riven in another part of the high platform from which
the orchard had been detached, and the river immediately entered the
fissure, leaving its former bed completely dry. A small inhabited
house, standing on the mass of earth carried down into the valley, went
along with it entire, and without injury to the inhabitants. The olive-trees,
also, continued to grow on the land which had slid into the valley,
and bore the same year an abundant crop of fruit.</p>

2, New bed of the river Caridi.<br />
3, Town of Soriano.</p></div>

<p>Two tracts of land on which a great part of the town of Polistena
stood, consisting of some hundreds of houses, were detached into a contiguous
ravine, and nearly across it, about half a mile from their original
site; and what is most extraordinary, several of the inhabitants were
dug out from the ruins alive and unhurt.</p>

<p>Two tenements, near Mileto, called the Macini and Vaticano, occupying
an extent of ground about a mile long and half a mile broad,
were carried for a mile down a valley. A thatched cottage, together
with large olive and mulberry trees, most of which remained erect, were
carried uninjured to this extraordinary distance. According to Hamilton,
the surface removed had been long undermined by rivulets, which
were afterwards in full view on the bare spot deserted by the tenements.
The earthquake seems to have opened a passage in the adjoining argillaceous
hills, which admitted water charged with loose soil into the
subterranean channels of the rivulets immediately under the tenements,
so that the foundations of the ground set in motion by the earthquake
were loosened. Another example of subsidence, where the edifices
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">487</a></span>
were not destroyed, is mentioned by Grimaldi, as having taken place in
the city of Catanzaro, the capital of the province of that name. The
houses in the quarter called San Giuseppe subsided with the ground to
various depths from two to four feet, but the buildings remained uninjured.</p>

<p class="center2">Landslips near Cinquefrondi, caused by the earthquake of 1783.</p></div>

<p>It would be tedious, and our space would not permit us, to follow the
different authors through their local details of landslips produced in
minor valleys; but they are highly interesting, as showing to how great
an extent the power of rivers to widen valleys, and to carry away large
portions of soil towards the sea, is increased where earthquakes are of
periodical occurrence. Among other territories, that of Cinquefrondi,
was greatly convulsed, various portions of soil being raised or sunk, and
innumerable fissures traversing the country in all directions (see <a href="#f85">fig. 85</a>).
Along the flanks of a small valley in this district there appears to have
been an almost uninterrupted line of landslips.</p>

<p><i>Currents of mud.</i>&mdash;Near S. Lucido, among other places, the soil is
described as having been "dissolved," so that large torrents of mud inundated
all the low grounds, like lava. Just emerging from this mud,
the tops only of trees and of the ruins of farm-houses were seen. Two
miles from Laureana, the swampy soil in two ravines became filled with
calcareous matter, which oozed out from the ground immediately before
the first great shock. This mud, rapidly accumulating, began, ere long,
to roll onward, like a flood of lava, into the valley, where the two streams
uniting, moved forward with increased impetus from east to west. It
now presented a breadth of 225 feet by 15 in depth, and, before it ceased
to move, covered a surface equal in length to an Italian mile. In its
progress it overwhelmed a flock of thirty goats, and tore up by the roots
many olive and mulberry trees, which floated like ships upon its surface.
When this calcareous lava had ceased to move, it gradually became dry
and hard, during which process the mass was lowered seven feet and a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">488</a></span>
half. It contained fragments of earth of a ferruginous color, and emitting
a sulphureous smell.</p>

<p><i>Fall of the sea-cliffs.</i>&mdash;Along the sea-coast of the Straits of Messina,
near the celebrated rock of Scilla, the fall of huge masses detached from
the bold and lofty cliffs overwhelmed many villas and gardens. At Gian
Greco, a continuous line of cliff, for a mile in length, was thrown down.
Great agitation was frequently observed in the bed of the sea during
the shocks, and, on those parts of the coast where the movement was
most violent, all kinds of fish were taken in abundance, and with unusual
facility. Some rare species, as that called Cicirelli, which usually lie
buried in the sand, were taken on the surface of the waters in great
quantity. The sea is said to have boiled up near Messina, and to have
been agitated as if by a copious discharge of vapors from its bottom.</p>

<p><i>Shore near Scilla inundated.</i>&mdash;The prince of Scilla had persuaded a
great part of his vassals to betake themselves to their fishing-boats for
safety, and he himself had gone on board. On the night of the 5th of
February, when some of the people were sleeping in the boats, and others
on a level plain slightly elevated above the sea, the earth rocked, and
suddenly a great mass was torn from the contiguous Mount Jaci, and
thrown down with a dreadful crash upon the plain. Immediately afterwards,
the sea, rising more than twenty feet above the level of this low
tract, rolled foaming over it, and swept away the multitude. It then
retreated, but soon rushed back again with greater violence, bringing
with it some of the people and animals it had carried away. At the same
time every boat was sunk or dashed against the beach, and some of them
were swept far inland. The aged prince, with 1430 of his people, was
destroyed.</p>

<p><i>State of Stromboli and Etna during the shocks.</i>&mdash;The inhabitants of
Pizzo remarked that on the 5th of February, 1783, when the first great
shock afflicted Calabria, the volcano of Stromboli, which is in full view
of that town, and at the distance of about fifty miles, smoked less, and
threw up a less quantity of inflamed matter than it had done for some
years previously. On the other hand, the great crater of Etna is said
to have given out a considerable quantity of vapor towards the beginning,
and Stromboli towards the close, of the commotions. But as no
eruption happened from either of these great vents during the whole
earthquake, the sources of the Calabrian convulsions, and of the volcanic
fires of Etna and Stromboli, appear to be very independent of each other;
unless, indeed, they have the same mutual relation as Vesuvius and the
volcanoes of the Phlegr&aelig;an Fields and Ischia, a violent disturbance in
one district serving as a safety-valve to the other, and both never being
in full activity at once.</p>

<p><i>Excavation of valleys.</i>&mdash;It is impossible for the geologist to consider
attentively the effect of this single earthquake of 1783, and to look forward
to the alterations in the physical condition of the country to which
a continued series of such movements will hereafter give rise, without
perceiving that the formation of valleys by running water can never be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">489</a></span>
understood, if we consider the question independently of the agency of
earthquakes. It must not be imagined that rivers only begin to act when
a country is already elevated far above the level of the sea, for their
action must of necessity be most powerful while land is <i>rising</i> and <i>sinking</i>
by successive movements. Whether Calabria is now undergoing
any considerable change of relative level, in regard to the sea, or is, upon
the whole, nearly stationary, is a question which our observations, confined
almost entirely to the last half century, cannot possibly enable us
to determine. But we know that strata, containing species of shells
identical with those now living in the contiguous parts of the Mediterranean,
have been raised in that country, as they have in Sicily, to the
height of several thousand feet.</p>

<p>Now, those geologists who grant that the present course of Nature
in the inanimate world has continued the same since the existing species
of animals were in being, will not feel surprised that the Calabrian streams
and rivers have cut out of such comparatively modern strata a great system
of valleys, varying in depth from fifty to six hundred feet, and often
several miles wide, if they consider how numerous may have been the
shocks which accompanied the uplifting of those recent marine strata to
so prodigious a height. Some speculators, indeed, who disregard the
analogy of existing nature, and who are always ready to assume that her
forces were more energetic in by-gone ages, may dispense with a long
series of movements, and suppose that Calabria "rose like an exhalation"
from the deep, after the manner of Milton's Pandemonium. But such
an hypothesis would deprive them of that peculiar removing force required
to form a regular system of deep and wide valleys; for <i>time</i>,
which they are so unwilling to assume, is essential to the operation.
Time must be allowed in the intervals between distinct convulsions, for
running water to clear away the ruins caused by landslips, otherwise the
fallen masses will serve as buttresses, and prevent the succeeding earthquake
from exerting its full power. The sides of the valley must be
again cut away by the stream, and made to form precipices and overhanging
cliffs, before the next shock can take effect in the same manner.</p>

<p>Possibly the direction of the succeeding shock may not coincide with
that of the valley, a great extent of adjacent country being equally
shaken. Still it will usually happen that no permanent geographical
change will be produced except in valleys. In them alone will occur
landslips from the boundary cliffs, and these will frequently divert the
stream from its accustomed course, causing the original ravine to become
both wider and more tortuous in its direction.</p>

<p>If a single convulsion of extreme violence should agitate at once an
entire hydrographical basin, or if the shocks should follow each other
too rapidly, the previously existing valleys would be annihilated, instead
of being modified and enlarged. Every stream might in that case be
compelled to begin its operations anew, and to shape out new channels,
instead of continuing to deepen and widen those already excavated. But
if the subterranean movements have been intermittent, and if sufficient
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">490</a></span>
periods have always intervened between the severer shocks to allow the
drainage of the country to be nearly restored to its original state, then
are both the kind and degree of force supplied by which running water
may hollow out valleys of any depth or size consistent with the elevation
above the sea which the districts drained by them may have attained.</p>

<p>When we read of the drying up and desertion of the channels of
rivers, the accounts most frequently refer to their deflection into some
other part of the same alluvial plain, perhaps several miles distant. Under
certain circumstances a change of level may undoubtedly force the water
to flow over into some distinct hydrographical basin; but even then it
will fall immediately into some other system of valleys already formed.</p>

<p>We learn from history that, ever since the first Greek colonists settled
in Calabria, that region has been subject to devastation by earthquakes;
and, for the last century and a half, ten years have seldom elapsed without
a shock; but the severer convulsions have not only been separated
by intervals of twenty, fifty, or one hundred years, but have not affected
precisely the same points when they recurred. Thus the earthquake of
1783, although confined within the same geographical limits as that of
1638, and not very inferior in violence, visited, according to Grimaldi,
very different districts. The points where the local intensity of the
force is developed being thus perpetually varied, more time is allowed
for the removal of separate mountain masses thrown into river-channels
by each shock.</p>

<p><i>Number of persons who perished during the earthquake.</i>&mdash;The number
of persons who perished during the earthquake in the two Calabrias and
Sicily, is estimated by Hamilton at about forty thousand; and about
twenty thousand more died by epidemics, which were caused by insufficient
nourishment, exposure to the atmosphere, and malaria, arising
from the new stagnant lakes and pools.</p>

<p>By far the greater number were buried under the ruins of their houses;
but many were burnt to death in the conflagrations which almost invariably
followed the shocks. These fires raged the more violently in
some cities, such as Oppido, from the immense magazines of oil which
were consumed.</p>

<p>Many persons were engulfed in deep fissures, especially the peasants
when flying across the open country, and their skeletons may perhaps
be buried in the earth to this day, at the depth of several hundred feet.</p>

<p>When Dolomieu visited Messina after the shock of Feb. 5th, he describes
the city as still presenting, at least at a distance, an imperfect
image of its ancient splendor. Every house was injured, but the walls
were standing; the whole population had taken refuge in wooden huts
in the neighborhood, and all was solitude and silence in the streets: it
seemed as if the city had been desolated by the plague, and the impression
made upon his feelings was that of melancholy and sadness. "But
when I passed over to Calabria, and first beheld Polistena, the scene of
horror almost deprived me of my faculties; my mind was filled with
mingled compassion and terror; nothing had escaped; all was levelled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">491</a></span>
with the dust; not a single house or piece of wall remained; on all sides
were heaps of stone so destitute of form, that they gave no conception
of there ever having been a town on the spot. The stench of the dead
bodies still rose from the ruins. I conversed with many persons who
had been buried for three, four, and even for five days; I questioned
them respecting their sensations in so dreadful a situation, and they
agreed that of all the physical evils they endured, thirst was the most
intolerable; and that their mental agony was increased by the idea that
they were abandoned by their friends, who might have rendered them
assistance."<a name="FNanchor_672" id="FNanchor_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a></p>

<p>It is supposed that about a fourth part of the inhabitants of Polistena,
and of some other towns, were buried alive, and might have been saved
had there been no want of hands; but in so general a calamity, where
each was occupied with his own misfortunes or those of his family, aid
could rarely be obtained. Neither tears, nor supplications, nor promises
of high rewards were listened to. Many acts of self-devotion, prompted
by parental and conjugal tenderness, or by friendship, or the gratitude
of faithful servants, are recorded; but individual exertions were, for the
most part, ineffectual. It frequently happened, that persons in search
of those most dear to them could hear their moans,&mdash;could recognize
their voices&mdash;were certain of the exact spot where they lay buried beneath
their feet, yet could afford them no succor. The piled mass
resisted all their strength, and rendered their efforts of no avail.</p>

<p>At Terranuova, four Augustin monks, who had taken refuge in a
vaulted sacristy, the arch of which continued to support an immense pile
of ruins, made their cries heard for the space of four days. One only of
the brethren of the whole convent was saved, and "of what avail was
his strength to remove the enormous weight of rubbish which had overwhelmed
his companions?" He heard their voices die away gradually;
and when afterwards their four corpses were disinterred, they were found
clasped in each other's arms. Affecting narratives are preserved of
mothers saved after the fifth, sixth, and even seventh day of their interment,
when their infants or children had perished with hunger.</p>

<p>It might have been imagined that the sight of sufferings such as these
would have been sufficient to awaken sentiments of humanity and pity in
the most savage breasts; but while some acts of heroism are related,
nothing could exceed the general atrocity of conduct displayed by the
Calabrian peasants: they abandoned the farms, and flocked in great
numbers into the towns&mdash;not to rescue their countrymen from a lingering
death, but to plunder. They dashed through the streets, fearless of
danger, amid tottering walls and clouds of dust, trampling beneath their
feet the bodies of the wounded and half-buried, and often stripping them,
while yet living, of their clothes.<a name="FNanchor_673" id="FNanchor_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a></p>

<p><i>Concluding remarks.</i>&mdash;But to enter more fully into these details would
be foreign to the purpose of the present work, and several volumes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">492</a></span>
would be required to give the reader a just idea of the sufferings which
the inhabitants of many populous districts have undergone during the
earthquakes of the last 150 years. A bare mention of the loss of life&mdash;as
that fifty or a hundred thousand souls perished in one catastrophe&mdash;conveys
to the reader no idea of the extent of misery inflicted: we must
learn, from the narratives of eye-witnesses, the various forms in which
death was encountered, the numbers who escaped with loss of limbs or
serious bodily injuries, and the multitude who were suddenly reduced to
penury and want. It has been often remarked, that the dread of earthquakes
is strongest in the minds of those who have experienced them
most frequently; whereas, in the case of almost every other danger,
familiarity with peril renders men intrepid. The reason is obvious&mdash;scarcely
any part of the mischief apprehended in this instance is imaginary;
the first shock is often the most destructive; and, as it may occur
in the dead of the night, or if by day, without giving the least warning
of its approach, no forethought can guard against it; and when the convulsion
has begun, no skill, or courage, or presence of mind, can point
out the path of safety. During the intervals, of uncertain duration,
between the more fatal shocks, slight tremors of the soil are not unfrequent;
and as these sometimes precede more violent convulsions, they
become a source of anxiety and alarm. The terror arising from this
cause alone is of itself no inconsiderable evil.</p>

<p>Although sentiments of pure religion are frequently awakened by these
awful visitations, yet we more commonly find that an habitual state of
fear, a sense of helplessness, and a belief in the futility of all human exertions,
prepare the minds of the vulgar for the influence of a demoralizing
superstition.</p>

<p>Where earthquakes are frequent, there can never be perfect security
of property under the best government; industry cannot be assured of
reaping the fruits of its labor; and the most daring acts of outrage may
occasionally be perpetrated with impunity, when the arm of the law is
paralyzed by the general consternation. It is hardly necessary to add,
that the progress of civilization and national wealth must be retarded by
convulsions which level cities to the ground, destroy harbors, render
roads impassable, and cause the most cultivated valley-plains to be
covered with lakes, or the ruins of adjoining hills.</p>

<p>Those geologists who imagine that, at remote periods ere man became
a sojourner on earth, the volcanic agency was more energetic than now,
should be careful to found their opinion on strict geological evidence, and
not permit themselves to be biased, as they have often been, by a
notion, that the disturbing force would probably be mitigated for the
sake of man.</p>

<p>I shall endeavor to point out in the sequel, that the general tendency
of subterranean movements, when their effects are considered for a sufficient
lapse of ages, is eminently beneficial, and that they constitute an
essential part of that mechanism by which the integrity of the habitable
surface is preserved, and the very existence and perpetuation of dry land
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">493</a></span>
secured. Why the working of this same machinery should be attended
with so much evil, is a mystery far beyond the reach of our philosophy,
and must probably remain so until we are permitted to investigate, not
our planet alone and its inhabitants, but other parts of the moral and
material universe with which they may be connected. Could our survey
embrace other worlds, and the events, not of a few centuries only,
but of periods as indefinite as those with which geology renders us
familiar, some apparent contradictions might be reconciled, and some
difficulties would doubtless be cleared up. But even then, as our capacities
are finite, while the scheme of the universe may be infinite, both
in time and space, it is presumptuous to suppose that all sources of doubt
and perplexity would ever be removed. On the contrary, they might,
perhaps, go on augmenting in number, although our confidence in the
wisdom of the plan of Nature should increase at the same time; for it
has been justly said, that the greater the circle of light, the greater the
boundary of darkness by which it is surrounded.<a name="FNanchor_674" id="FNanchor_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a></p>

<p>In the preceding chapters we have considered a small part only of
those earthquakes which have occurred during the last seventy years,
of which accurate and authentic descriptions happen to have been recorded.
In examining those of earlier date, we find their number so great
that allusion can be made to a few only respecting which information
of peculiar geological interest has been obtained.</p>

<p><i>Java</i>, 1772.&mdash;<i>Truncation of a lofty cone.</i>&mdash;In the year 1772, Papandayang,
formerly one of the loftiest volcanoes in the island of Java, was
in eruption. Before all the inhabitants on the declivities of the mountain
could save themselves by flight, the ground began to give way,
and a great part of the volcano fell in and disappeared. It is estimated
that an extent of ground of the mountain itself and its immediate environs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">494</a></span>
fifteen miles long and full six broad, was by this commotion swallowed
up in the bowels of the earth. Forty villages were destroyed,
some being engulfed and some covered by the substances thrown out
on this occasion, and 2957 of the inhabitants perished. A proportionate
number of cattle were also killed, and most of the plantations of cotton,
indigo, and coffee in the adjacent districts were buried under the volcanic
matter. This catastrophe appears to have resembled, although on
a grander scale, that of the ancient Vesuvius in the year 79. The cone
was reduced in height from 9000 to about 5000 feet; and, as vapors
still escape from the crater on its summit, a new cone may one day rise
out of the ruins of the ancient mountain, as the modern Vesuvius has
risen from the remains of Somma.<a name="FNanchor_675" id="FNanchor_675"></a><a href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a></p>

<p><i>St. Domingo</i>, 1770.&mdash;During a tremendous earthquake which destroyed
a great part of St. Domingo, innumerable fissures were caused
throughout the island, from which mephitic vapors emanated and produced
an epidemic. <i>Hot springs</i> burst forth in many places where there
had been no water before; but after a time they ceased to flow.<a name="FNanchor_676" id="FNanchor_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a></p>

<p>In a previous earthquake, in November, 1751, a violent shock destroyed
the capital, Port au Prince, and part of the coast, twenty
leagues in length, sank down, and has ever since formed a bay of the
sea.<a name="FNanchor_677" id="FNanchor_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a></p>

<p><i>Hindostan</i>, 1762.&mdash;The town of Chittagong, in Bengal, was violently
shaken by an earthquake, on the 2d of April, 1762, the earth opening
in many places, and throwing up water and mud of a sulphureous smell.
At a place called Bardavan, a large river was dried up; and at Bar
Charra, near the sea, a tract of ground sunk down, and 200 people,
with all their cattle, were lost. It is said, that sixty square miles of the
Chittagong coast suddenly and permanently subsided during this earthquake,
and that Ces-lung-Toom, one of the Mug mountains, entirely disappeared,
and another sank so low, that its summit only remained visible.
Four hills are also described as having been variously rent asunder,
leaving open chasms from thirty to sixty feet in width. Towns which
subsided several cubits, were overflowed with water; among others,
Deep Gong, which was submerged to the depth of seven cubits. Two
volcanoes are said to have opened in the Secta Cunda hills. The shock
was also felt at Calcutta.<a name="FNanchor_678" id="FNanchor_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a> While the Chittagong coast was sinking, a
corresponding rise of the ground took place at the island of Ramree,
and at Cheduba (see Map, <a href="#f39">fig. 39</a>, p. 351).<a name="FNanchor_679" id="FNanchor_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a></p>

<p><i>Lisbon</i>, 1755.&mdash;In no part of the volcanic region of southern Europe
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_495" id="Page_495">495</a></span>
has so tremendous an earthquake occurred in modern times, as that
which began on the 1st of November, 1755, at Lisbon. A sound of
thunder was heard underground, and immediately afterwards a violent
shock threw down the greater part of that city. In the course of about
six minutes, sixty thousand persons perished. The sea first retired and
laid the bar dry; it then rolled in, rising fifty feet or more above its
ordinary level. The mountains of Arrabida, Estrella, Julio, Marvan,
and Cintra, being some of the largest in Portugal, were impetuously
shaken, as it were, from their very foundations; and some of them
opened at their summits, which were split and rent in a wonderful manner,
huge masses of them being thrown down into the subjacent valleys.<a name="FNanchor_680" id="FNanchor_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a>
Flames are related to have issued from these mountains, which
are supposed to have been electric; they are also said to have smoked;
but vast clouds of dust may have given rise to this appearance.</p>

<p>The area over which this convulsion extended is very remarkable.
It has been computed, says Humboldt,<a name="FNanchor_681" id="FNanchor_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a> that on the 1st November,
1755, a portion of the earth's surface four times greater than the extent
of Europe was simultaneously shaken. The shock was felt in the
Alps, and on the coast of Sweden, in small inland lakes on the shores
of the Baltic, in Thuringia, and in the flat country of northern Germany.
The thermal springs of Toplitz dried up, and again returned, inundating
every thing with water discolored by ochre. In the islands of Antigua,
Barbadoes, and Martinique in the West Indies, where the tide usually
rises little more than two feet, it suddenly rose above twenty feet, the
water being discolored and of an inky blackness. The movement was
also sensible in the great lakes of Canada. At Algiers and Fez, in the
north of Africa, the agitation of the earth was as violent as in Spain
and Portugal; and at the distance of eight leagues from Morocco, a
village with the inhabitants, to the number of about 8000 or 10,000
persons, are said to have been swallowed up; the earth soon afterwards
closing over them.</p>

<p><i>Subsidence of the quay.</i>&mdash;Among other extraordinary events related
to have occurred at Lisbon during the catastrophe was the subsidence
of a new quay, built entirely of marble at an immense expense. A
great concourse of people had collected there for safety, as a spot where
they might be beyond the reach of falling ruins; but suddenly the
quay sank down with all the people on it, and not one of the dead
bodies ever floated to the surface. A great number of boats and small
vessels anchored near it, all full of people, were swallowed up, as in
a whirlpool.<a name="FNanchor_682" id="FNanchor_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a> No fragments of these wrecks ever rose again to the surface,
and the water in the place where the quay had stood is stated, in
many accounts, to be unfathomable; but Whitehurst says he ascertained
it to be one hundred fathoms.<a name="FNanchor_683" id="FNanchor_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">496</a></span>
Circumstantial as are the contemporary narratives, I learn from a
correspondent, Mr. F. Freeman, in 1841, that no part of the Tagus was
then more than thirty feet deep at high tide, and an examination of the
position of the new quay, and the memorials preserved of the time and
manner in which it was built, rendered the statement of so great a subsidence
in 1755 quite unintelligible. Perhaps a deep narrow chasm, such
as was before described in Calabria (p. 481), opened and closed again
in the bed of the Tagus, after swallowing up some incumbent buildings
and vessels. We have already seen that such openings may collapse
after the shock suddenly, or, in places where the strata are of soft and
yielding materials, very gradually. According to the observations made
at Lisbon, in 1837, by Mr. Sharpe, the destroying effects of this earthquake
were confined to the tertiary strata, and were most violent on the
blue clay, on which the lower part of the city is constructed. Not a
building, he says, on the secondary limestone or the basalt was injured.<a name="FNanchor_684" id="FNanchor_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a></p>

<p><i>Shocks felt at sea.</i>&mdash;The shock was felt at sea, on the deck of a ship
to the west of Lisbon, and produced very much the same sensation as
on dry land. Off St. Lucar, the captain of the ship Nancy felt his
vessel so violently shaken, that he thought she had struck the ground;
but, on heaving the lead, found a great depth of water. Captain Clark,
from Denia, in latitude 36&deg; 24' N., between nine and ten in the morning,
had his ship shaken and strained as if she had struck upon a rock,
so that the seams of the deck opened, and the compass was overturned
in the binnacle. Another ship, forty leagues west of St. Vincent, experienced
so violent a concussion, that the men were thrown a foot and
a half perpendicularly up from the deck.</p>

<p><i>Rate at which the movement travelled.</i>&mdash;The agitation of lakes, rivers,
and springs, in Great Britain, was remarkable. At Loch Lomond, in
Scotland, for example, the water, without, the least apparent cause,
rose against its banks, and then subsided below its usual level. The
greatest perpendicular height of this swell was two feet four inches. It
is said that the movement of this earthquake was undulatory, and that
it travelled at the rate of twenty miles a minute, its velocity being calculated
by the intervals between the time when the first shock was felt
at Lisbon, and its time of occurrence at other distant places.<a name="FNanchor_685" id="FNanchor_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a></p>

<p><i>Great wave and retreat of the sea.</i>&mdash;A great wave swept over the
coast of Spain, and is said to have been sixty feet high at Cadiz. At
Tangier, in Africa, it rose and fell eighteen times on the coast. At
Funchal, in Madeira, it rose full fifteen feet perpendicular above high-water
mark, although the tide, which ebbs and flows there seven feet,
was then at half-ebb. Besides entering the city, and committing great
havoc, it overflowed other seaports in the island. At Kinsale, in Ireland,
a body of water rushed into the harbor, whirled round several vessels,
and poured into the market-place.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">497</a></span>
It was before stated that the sea first retired at Lisbon; and this retreat
of the ocean from the shore, at the commencement of an earthquake,
and its subsequent return in a violent wave, is a common occurrence.
In order to account for the phenomenon, Michell imagined a subsidence
at the bottom of the sea, from the giving way of the roof of some cavity
in consequence of a vacuum produced by the condensation of steam.
Such condensation, he observes, might be the first effect of the introduction
of a large body of water into fissures and cavities already filled
with steam, before there has been sufficient time for the heat of the incandescent
lava to turn so large a supply of water into steam, which
being soon accomplished causes a greater explosion.</p>

<p>Another proposed explanation is, the sudden rise of the land, which
would cause the sea to abandon immediately the ancient line of coast;
and if the shore, after being thus heaved up, should fall again to its
original level, the ocean would return. This theory, however, will not
account for the facts observed during the Lisbon earthquake; for the
retreat preceded the wave, not only on the coast of Portugal, but also
at the island of Madeira, and several other places. If the upheaving of
the coast of Portugal had caused the retreat, the motion of the waters,
when propagated to Madeira, would have produced a wave previous to
the retreat. Nor could the motion of the waters at Madeira have been
caused by a different local earthquake; for the shock travelled from
Lisbon to Madeira in two hours, which agrees with the time which it
required to reach other places equally distant.<a name="FNanchor_686" id="FNanchor_686"></a><a href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a></p>

<p>The following is another solution of the problem, which has been
offered:&mdash;Suppose a portion of the bed of the sea to be suddenly upheaved;
the first effect will be to raise over the elevated part a body
of water, the momentum of which will carry it much above the level it
will afterwards assume, causing a draught or receding of the water from
the neighboring coasts, followed immediately by the return of the displaced
water, which will also be impelled by its momentum much farther
and higher on the coast than its former level.<a name="FNanchor_687" id="FNanchor_687"></a><a href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a></p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, when alluding to similar waves on the coast of Chili,
states his opinion, that "the whole phenomenon is due to a common undulation
in the water, proceeding from a line or point of disturbance
some little way distant. If the waves," he says, "sent off from the
paddles of a steam-vessel be watched breaking on the sloping shore of
a still river, the water will be seen first to retire two or three feet, and
then to return in little breakers, precisely analogous to those consequent
on an earthquake." He also adds, that "the earthquake-wave occurs
some time after the shock, the water at first retiring both from the
shores of the mainland and of outlying islands, and then returning in
mountainous breakers. Their size is modified by the form of the neighboring
coast; for it is ascertained in South America, that places situated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_498" id="Page_498">498</a></span>
at the head of shoaling bays have suffered most, whereas towns like
Valparaiso, seated close on the border of a profound ocean, have never
been inundated, though severely shaken by earthquakes."<a name="FNanchor_688" id="FNanchor_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a></p>

<p>More recently (February, 1846), Mr. Mallet, in his memoir above
cited (p. <a href="#Page_475">475</a>), has endeavored to bring to bear on this difficult subject
the more advanced knowledge obtained of late years respecting the true
theory of waves. He conceives that when the origin of the shock is beneath
the deep ocean, one wave is propagated through the land, and
another moving with inferior velocity is formed on the surface of the
ocean. This last rolls in upon the land long after the earth-wave has
arrived and spent itself. However irreconcilable it may be to our common
notions of solid bodies, to imagine them capable of transmitting,
with such extreme velocity, motions analogous to tidal waves, it seems
nevertheless certain that such undulations are produced, and it is supposed
that when the shock passes a given point, each particle of the solid
earth describes an ellipse in space. The facility with which all the particles
of a solid mass can be made to vibrate may be illustrated, says
Gay Lussac, by many familiar examples. If we apply the ear to one
end of a long wooden beam, and listen attentively when the other end
is struck by a pin's head, we hear the shock distinctly; which shows
that every fibre throughout the whole length has been made to vibrate.
The rattling of carriages on the pavement shakes the largest edifices;
and in the quarries underneath some quarters in Paris, it is found that
the movement is communicated through a considerable thickness of
rock.<a name="FNanchor_689" id="FNanchor_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a></p>

<p>The great sea-wave originating directly over the centre of disturbance
is propagated, as Michell correctly stated, in every direction, like the
circle upon a pond when a pebble is dropped into it, the different rates
at which it moves depending (as he also suggested) on variations in the
depth of the water. This wave of the sea, says Mr. Mallet, is raised by
the impulse of the shock immediately below it, which in great earthquakes
lifts up the ground two or three feet perpendicularly. The
velocity of the shock, or earth-wave, is greater because it "depends upon
a function of the elasticity of the crust of the earth, whereas the velocity
of the sea-wave depends upon a function of the depth of the sea."</p>

<p>"Although the shock in its passage under the deep ocean gives no
trace of its progress, it no sooner gets into soundings or shallow water,
than it gives rise to another and smaller wave of the sea. It carries, as
it were, upon its back, this lesser aqueous undulation; a long narrow ridge
of water which corresponds in form and velocity to itself, being pushed
up by the partial elevation of the bottom. It is this small wave, called
technically the 'forced sea-wave,' which communicates the earthquake-shock
to ships at sea, as if they had struck upon a rock. It breaks
upon a coast at the same moment that the shock reaches it, and sometimes
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_499" id="Page_499">499</a></span>
it may cause an apparent slight recession from the shore, followed
by its flowing up somewhat higher than the usual tide mark: this will
happen where the beach is very sloping, as is usual where the sea is
shallow, for then the velocity of the low flat earth-wave is such, that it
slips as it were, from under the undulation in the fluid above. It does
this at the moment of reaching the beach, which it elevates by a vertical
height equal to its own, and as instantly lets drop again to its former
level."</p>

<p>"While the shock propagated through the solid earth has thus travelled
with extra rapidity to the land, the great sea-wave has been following
at a slower pace, though advancing at the rate of several miles
in a minute. It consists, in the deep ocean, of a long low swell of enormous
volume, having an equal slope before and behind, and that so
gentle that it might pass under a ship without being noticed. But when
it reaches the edge of soundings, its front slope, like that of a tidal wave
under similar circumstances, becomes short and steep, while its rear
slope is long and gentle. If there be water of some depth close into
shore, this great wave may roll in long after the shock, and do little
damage; but if the shore be shelving, there will be first a retreat of the
water, and then the wave will break upon the beach and roll in far
upon the land."<a name="FNanchor_690" id="FNanchor_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a></p>

<p>The various opinions which have been offered by Michell and later
writers, respecting the remote causes of earthquake shocks in the interior
of the earth, will more properly be discussed in the thirty-second
chapter.</p>

<p><i>Chili</i>, 1751.&mdash;On the 24th of May, 1751, the ancient town of Conception,
otherwise called Penco, was totally destroyed by an earthquake,
and the sea rolled over it. (See plan of the bay, <a href="#f70">fig. 70</a>, p. 455.) The
ancient port was rendered entirely useless, and the inhabitants built
another town about ten miles from the sea-coast, in order to be beyond
the reach of similar inundations. At the same time, a colony recently
settled on the sea-shore of Juan Fernandez was almost entirely overwhelmed
by a wave which broke upon the shore.</p>

<p>It has been already stated, that in 1835, or eighty-four years after
the destruction of Penco, the same coast was overwhelmed by a similar
flood from the sea during an earthquake; and it is also known that
twenty-one years before (or in 1730), a like wave rolled over these
fated shores, in which many of the inhabitants perished. A series of
similar catastrophes has also been tracked back as far as the year 1590,<a name="FNanchor_691" id="FNanchor_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a>
beyond which we have no memorials save those of oral tradition. Molina,
who has recorded the customs and legends of the aborigines, tells us,
that the Araucanian Indians, a tribe inhabiting the country between the
Andes and the Pacific, including the part now called Chili, "had among
them a tradition of a great deluge, in which only a few persons were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_500" id="Page_500">500</a></span>
saved, who took refuge upon a high mountain called Thegtheg, "the
thundering," which had three points. Whenever a violent earthquake
occurs, these people fly for safety to the mountains, assigning as a reason,
that they are fearful, after the shock, that the sea will again return
and deluge the world.<a name="FNanchor_692" id="FNanchor_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a></p>

<p>Notwithstanding the tendency of writers in his day to refer all traditionary
inundations to one remote period, Molina remarks that this
flood of the Araucanians "was probably very different from that of
Noah." We have, indeed, no means of conjecturing how long this same
tribe had flourished in Chili, but we can scarcely doubt, that if its experience
reached back even for three or four centuries, several inroads
of the ocean must have occurred within that period. But the memory
of a succession of physical events, similar in kind, though distinct in
time, can never be preserved by a people destitute of written annals.
Before two or three generations have passed away all dates are forgotten,
and even the events themselves, unless they have given origin to
some customs, or religious rites and ceremonies. Oftentimes the incidents
of many different earthquakes and floods become blended
together in the same narrative; and in such cases the single catastrophe
is described in terms so exaggerated, or is so disguised by
mythological fictions, as to be utterly valueless to the antiquary or philosopher.</p>

<p><i>Proofs of elevation of twenty-four feet.</i>&mdash;During a late survey of Conception
Bay, Captain Beechey and Sir E. Belcher discovered that the
ancient harbor, which formerly admitted all large merchant vessels
which went round the Cape, is now occupied by a reef of sandstone,
certain points of which project above the sea at low water, the greater
part being very shallow. A tract of a mile and a half in length, where,
according to the report of the inhabitants, the water was formerly four
or five fathoms deep, is now a shoal; consisting, as our hydrographers
found, of hard sandstone, so that it cannot be supposed to have been
formed by recent deposits of the river Biobio, an arm of which carries
down loose micaceous sand into the same bay.</p>

<p>It is impossible at this distance of time to affirm that the bed of the
sea was uplifted at once to the height of twenty-four feet, during the
single earthquake of 1751, because other movements may have occurred
subsequently; but it is said, that ever since the shock of 1751, no vessels
have been able to approach within a mile and a half of the ancient
port of Penco. (See Map, p. 455.) In proof of the former elevation
of the coast near Penco our surveyors found above high-water mark an
enormous bed of shells of the same species as those now living in the
bay, filled with micaceous sand like that which the Biobio now conveys
to the bay. These shells, as well as others, which cover the adjoining
hills of mica-schist to the height of several hundred feet, have lately
been examined by experienced conchologists in London, and identified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_501" id="Page_501">501</a></span>
with those taken at the same time in a living state from the bay and its
neighborhood.<a name="FNanchor_693" id="FNanchor_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a></p>

<p>Ulloa, therefore, was perfectly correct in his statement that, at various
heights above the sea between Talcahuano and Conception, "mines
were found of various sorts of shells used for lime of the very same kinds
as those found in the adjoining sea." Among them he mentions the
great mussel called Choros, and two others which he describes. Some
of these, he says, are entire, and others broken; they occur at the bottom
of the sea, in four, six, ten, or twelve fathom water, where they adhere
to a sea-plant called Cochayuyo. They are taken in dredges, and
have no resemblance to those found on the shore or in shallow water;
yet beds of them occur at various heights on the hills. "I was the
more pleased with the sight," he adds, "as it appeared to me a convincing
proof of the universality of the deluge, although I am not ignorant
that some have attributed their position to other causes."<a name="FNanchor_694" id="FNanchor_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> It has,
however, been ascertained that the foundation of the Castle of Penco
was so low in 1835, or at so inconsiderable an elevation above the highest
spring tides, as to discountenance the idea of any permanent upheaval
in modern times, on the site of that ancient port; but no exact measurements
or levellings appear as yet to have been made to determine this
point, which is the more worthy of investigation, because it may throw
some light on an opinion often promulgated of late years, that there
is a tendency in the Chilian coast, after each upheaval, to sink gradually
and return towards its former position.</p>

<p><i>Peru</i>, 1746.&mdash;Peru was visited, on the 28th of October, 1746, by a
tremendous earthquake. In the first twenty-four hours, two hundred
shocks were experienced. The ocean twice retired and returned impetuously
upon the land: Lima was destroyed, and part of the coast near
Callao was converted into a bay: four other harbors, among which were
Cavalla and Guanape, shared the same fate. There were twenty-three
ships and vessels, great and small, in the harbor of Callao, of which
nineteen were sunk; and the other four, among which was a frigate
called St. Fermin, were carried by the force of the waves to a great distance
up the country, and left on dry ground at a considerable height
above the sea. The number of inhabitants in this city amounted to four
thousand. Two hundred only escaped, twenty-two of whom were saved
on a small fragment of the fort of Vera Cruz, which remained as the only
memorial of the town after this dreadful inundation. Other portions of
its site were completely covered with heaps of sand and gravel.</p>

<p>A volcano in Lucanas burst forth the same night, and such quantities
of water descended from the cone that the whole country was overflowed;
and in the mountain near Pataz, called Conversiones de Caxamarquilla,
three other volcanoes burst out, and frightful torrents of water
swept down their sides.<a name="FNanchor_695" id="FNanchor_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">502</a></span>
There are several records of prior convulsions in Peru, accompanied by
similar inroads in the sea, one of which happened fifty-nine years before
(in 1687), when the ocean, according to Ulloa, first retired and then returned
in a mountainous wave, overwhelming Callao and its environs,
with the miserable inhabitants.<a name="FNanchor_696" id="FNanchor_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> This same wave, according to Lionel
Wafer, carried ships a league into the country, and drowned man and
beast for fifty leagues along the shore.<a name="FNanchor_697" id="FNanchor_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a> Inundations of still earlier dates
are carefully recorded by Ulloa, Wafer, Acosta, and various writers, who
describe them as having expended their chief fury, some on one part of
the coast and some on another.</p>

<p>But all authentic accounts cease when we ascend to the era of the
conquest of Peru by the Spaniards. The ancient Peruvians, although
far removed from barbarism, were without written annals, and therefore
unable to preserve a distinct recollection of a long series of natural
events. They had, however, according to Antonio de Herrera, who, in
the beginning of the seventeenth century, investigated their antiquities,
a tradition, "that many years before the reign of the Incas, at a
time when the country was very populous, there happened a great flood;
the sea breaking out beyond its bounds, so that the land was covered
with water and all the people perished. To this the Guacas, inhabiting
the vale of Xausca, and the natives of Chiquito, in the province of Callao,
add that some persons remained in the hollows and caves of the
highest mountains, who again peopled the land. Others of the mountain
people affirm that all perished in the deluge, only six persons being
saved on a float, from whom descended all the inhabitants of that country."<a name="FNanchor_698" id="FNanchor_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a></p>

<p>On the mainland near Lima, and on the neighboring island of San
Lorenzo, Mr. Darwin found proofs that the ancient bed of the sea had
been raised to the height of more than eighty feet above water within
the human epoch, strata having been discovered at that altitude, containing
pieces of cotton thread and plaited rush, together with sea-weed
and marine shells.<a name="FNanchor_699" id="FNanchor_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a> The same author learnt from Mr. Gill, a civil
engineer, that he discovered in the interior near Lima, between Casma
and Huaraz, the dried-up channel of a large river, sometimes worn
through solid rock, which, instead of continually ascending towards its
source, has, in one place, a steep downward slope in that direction, for a
ridge or line of hills has been uplifted directly across the bed of the
stream, which is now arched. By these changes the water has been
turned into some other course; and a district, once fertile, and still covered
with ruins, and bearing the marks of ancient cultivation, has been
converted into a desert.<a name="FNanchor_700" id="FNanchor_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a></p>

<p><i>Java</i>, 1699.&mdash;On the 5th of January, 1699, a terrible earthquake
visited Java, and no less than 208 considerable shocks were reckoned.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">503</a></span>
Many houses in Batavia were overturned, and the flame and noise of a
volcanic eruption were seen and heard in that city, which were afterwards
found to proceed from Mount Salek,<a name="FNanchor_701" id="FNanchor_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a> a volcano six days' journey
distant. Next morning the Batavian river, which has its rise from that
mountain, became very high and muddy, and brought down abundance
of bushes and trees, half burnt. The channel of the river being stopped
up, the water overflowed the country round the gardens about the town,
and some of the streets, so that fishes lay dead in them. All the fish
in the river, except the carps, were killed by the mud and turbid water.
A great number of drowned buffaloes, tigers, rhinoceroses, deer, apes,
and other wild beasts, were brought down by the current; and, "notwithstanding,"
observes one of the writers, "that a crocodile is amphibious,
several of them were found dead among the rest."<a name="FNanchor_702" id="FNanchor_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a></p>

<p>It is stated that seven hills bounding the river sank down; by which
is merely meant, as by similar expressions in the description of the Calabrian
earthquakes, seven great landslips. These hills, descending some
from one side of the valley and some from the other, filled the channel,
and the waters then finding their way under the mass, flowed out thick
and muddy. The Tangaran river was also dammed up by nine hills,
and in its channel were large quantities of drift trees. Seven of its
tributaries also are said to have been "covered up with earth." A high
tract of forest land, between the two great rivers before mentioned, is
described as having been changed into an open country, destitute of
trees, the surface being spread over with fine red clay. This part of
the account may, perhaps, merely refer to the sliding down of woody
tracts into the valleys, as happened to so many extensive vineyards and
olive-grounds in Calabria, in 1783. The close packing of large trees in
the Batavian river is represented as very remarkable, and it attests in a
striking manner the destruction of soil bordering the valleys which had
been caused by floods and landslips.<a name="FNanchor_703" id="FNanchor_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a></p>

<p><i>Quito</i>, 1698.&mdash;In Quito, on the 19th of July, 1698, during an earthquake,
a great part of the crater and summit of the volcano Carguairazo
fell in, and a stream of water and mud issued from the broken sides of
the hill.<a name="FNanchor_704" id="FNanchor_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a></p>

<p><i>Sicily</i>, 1693.&mdash;Shocks of earthquakes spread over all Sicily in 1693,
and on the 11th of January the city of Catania and forty-nine other
places were levelled to the ground, and about one hundred thousand
people killed. The bottom of the sea, says Vicentino Bonajutus, sank
down considerably, both in ports, inclosed bays, and open parts of the
coast, and water bubbled up along the shores. Numerous long fissures
of various breadths were caused, which threw out sulphurous water;
and one of them, in the plain of Catania (the delta of the Simeto), at
the distance of four miles from the sea, sent forth water as salt as the
sea. The stone buildings of a street in the city of Noto, for the length
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">504</a></span>
of half a mile, sank into the ground, and remained hanging on one side.
In another street, an opening large enough to swallow a man and horse
appeared.<a name="FNanchor_705" id="FNanchor_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a></p>

<p><i>Moluccas</i>, 1693.&mdash;The small Isle of Sorea, which consists of one
great volcano, was in eruption in the year 1693. Different parts of the
cone fell, one after the other, into a deep crater, until almost half the
space of the island was converted into a fiery lake. Most of the inhabitants
fled to Banda; but great pieces of the mountain continued to
fall down, so that the lake of lava became wider; and finally the whole
population was compelled to emigrate. It is stated that, in proportion
as the burning lake increased in size, the earthquakes were less vehement.<a name="FNanchor_706" id="FNanchor_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a></p>

<p><i>Jamaica</i>, 1692.&mdash;In the year 1692, the island of Jamaica was visited
by a violent earthquake; the ground swelled and heaved like a rolling
sea, and was traversed by numerous cracks, two or three hundred of
which were often seen at a time, opening and then closing rapidly
again. Many people were swallowed up in these rents; some the earth
caught by the middle, and squeezed to death; the heads of others only
appeared above ground; and some were first engulfed, and then cast
up again with great quantities of water. Such was the devastation,
that even in Port Royal, then the capital, where more houses are said
to have been left standing than in the whole island besides, three-quarters
of the buildings, together with the ground they stood on, sank down
with their inhabitants entirely under water.</p>

<p><i>Subsidence in the harbor.</i>&mdash;The large storehouses on the harbor side
subsided, so as to be twenty-four, thirty-six, and forty-eight feet under
water; yet many of them appear to have remained standing, for it is
stated that, after the earthquake, the mast-heads of several ships
wrecked in the harbor, together with the chimney-tops of houses, were
just seen projecting above the waves. A tract of land round the town,
about a thousand acres in extent, sank down in less than one minute,
during the first shock, and the sea immediately rolled in. The Swan
frigate, which was repairing in the wharf, was driven over the tops of
many buildings, and then thrown upon one of the roofs, through which
it broke. The breadth of one of the streets is said to have been doubled
by the earthquake.</p>

<p>According to Sir H. De la Beche, the part of Port Royal described
as having sunk was built upon newly formed land, consisting of sand,
in which piles had been driven; and the <i>settlement</i> of this loose sand,
charged with the weight of heavy houses, may, he suggests, have given
rise to the subsidence alluded to.<a name="FNanchor_707" id="FNanchor_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a></p>

<p>There have undoubtedly been instances in Calabria and elsewhere
of slides of land on which the houses have still remained standing; and
it is possible that such may have been the case at Port Royal. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">505</a></span>
fact at least of submergence is unquestionable, for I was informed by
the late Admiral Sir Charles Hamilton that he frequently saw the submerged
houses of Port Royal in the year 1780, in that part of the harbor
which lies between the town and the usual anchorage of men-of-war.
Bryan Edwards also says, in his history of the West Indies, that
in 1793 the <i>ruins</i> were visible in clear weather from the boats which
sailed over them.<a name="FNanchor_708" id="FNanchor_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a> Lastly, Lieutenant B. Jeffery, R. N., tells me that,
being engaged in a survey between the years 1824 and 1835, he repeatedly
visited the site in question, where the depth of the water is
from four to six fathoms, and whenever there was but little wind perceived
distinct traces of houses. He saw these more clearly when he
used the instrument called the "diver's eye," which is let down below
the ripple of the wave.<a name="FNanchor_709" id="FNanchor_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a></p>

<p>At several thousand places in Jamaica the earth is related to have
opened. On the north of the island several plantations, with their inhabitants,
were swallowed up, and a lake appeared in their place, covering
above a thousand acres, which afterwards dried up, leaving nothing
but sand and gravel, without the least sign that there had ever been a
house or a tree there. Several tenements at Yallows were buried under
land-slips; and one plantation was removed half a mile from its place,
the crops continuing to grow upon it uninjured. Between Spanish Town
and Sixteen-mile Walk, the high and perpendicular cliffs bounding the
river fell in, stopped the passage of the river and flooded the latter place
for nine days, so that the people "concluded it had been sunk as Port
Royal was." But the flood at length subsided, for the river had found
some new passage at a great distance.</p>

<p><i>Mountains shattered.</i>&mdash;The Blue and other of the highest mountains
are declared to have been strangely torn and rent. They appeared
shattered and half-naked, no longer affording a fine green prospect, as
before, but stripped of their woods and natural verdure. The rivers on
these mountains first ceased to flow for about twenty-four hours, and
then brought down into the sea, at Port Royal and other places, several
hundred thousand tons of timber, which looked like floating islands on
the ocean. The trees were in general barked, most of their branches
having been torn off in the descent. It is particularly remarked in this,
as in the narratives of so many earthquakes, that fish were taken in great
numbers on the coast during the shocks. The correspondents of Sir
Hans Sloane, who collected with care the accounts of eye-witnesses of
the catastrophe, refer constantly to <i>subsidences</i>, and some supposed the
whole of Jamaica to have sunk down.<a name="FNanchor_710" id="FNanchor_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a></p>

<p><i>Reflections on the amount of change in the last one hundred and sixty
years.</i>&mdash;I have now only enumerated some few of the earthquakes of the
last 160 years, respecting which facts illustrative of geological inquiries
are on record. Even if my limits permitted, it would be an unprofitable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">506</a></span>
task to examine all the obscure and ambiguous narratives of similar
events of earlier epochs; although, if the places were now examined by
geologists well practised in the art of interpreting the monuments of
physical changes, many events which have happened within the historical
era might doubtless be still determined with precision. It must
not be imagined that, in the above sketch of the occurrences of a short
period, I have given an account of all, or even the greater part, of the
mutations which the earth has undergone by the agency of subterranean
movements. Thus, for example, the earthquake of Aleppo, in the
present century, and of Syria, in the middle of the eighteenth, would
doubtless have afforded numerous phenomena, of great geological importance,
had those catastrophes been described by scientific observers.
The shocks in Syria in 1759, were protracted for three months, throughout
a space of ten thousand square leagues: an area compared to which
that of the Calabrian earthquake in 1783 was insignificant. Accon,
Saphat, Balbeck, Damascus, Sidon, Tripoli, and many other places, were
almost entirely levelled to the ground. Many thousands of the inhabitants
perished in each; and, in the valley of Balbeck alone, 20,000 men
are said to have been victims to the convulsion. In the absence of
scientific accounts, it would be as irrelevant to our present purpose to
enter into a detailed account of such calamities, as to follow the track of
an invading army, to enumerate the cities burnt or rased to the ground,
and reckon the number of individuals who perished by famine or the
sword.</p>

<p><i>Deficiency of historical records.</i>&mdash;If such, then, be the amount of
ascertained changes in the last 160 years, notwithstanding the extreme
deficiency of our records during that brief period, how important must
we presume the physical revolutions to have been in the course of thirty
or forty centuries, during which some countries habitually convulsed by
earthquakes have been peopled by civilized nations! Towns engulfed
during one earthquake may, by repeated shocks, have sunk to great
depths beneath the surface, while the ruins remain as imperishable as
the hardest rocks in which they are inclosed. Buildings and cities, submerged,
for a time, beneath seas or lakes, and covered with sedimentary
deposits, must, in some places, have been re-elevated to considerable
heights above the level of the ocean. The signs of these events have,
probably, been rendered visible by subsequent mutations, as by the encroachments
of the sea upon the coast, by deep excavations made by
torrents and rivers, by the opening of new ravines, and chasms, and other
effects of natural agents, so active in districts agitated by subterranean
movements.</p>

<p>If it be asked why, if such wonderful monuments exist, so few have
hitherto been brought to light, we reply&mdash;because they have not been
searched for. In order to rescue from oblivion the memorials of former
occurrences, the inquirer must know what he may reasonably expect to
discover, and under what peculiar local circumstances. He must be
acquainted with the action and effect of physical causes, in order to recognize,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">507</a></span>
explain, and describe correctly the phenomena when they present
themselves.</p>

<p>The best known of the great volcanic regions, of which the boundaries
were sketched in the twenty-second chapter, is that which includes
Southern Europe, Northern Africa, and Central Asia; yet nearly the
whole, even of this region, must be laid down, in a geological map, as
"Terra Incognita." Even Calabria may be regarded as unexplored, as
also Spain, Portugal, the Barbary States, the Ionian Isles, Asia Minor,
Cyprus, Syria, and the countries between the Caspian and Black seas.
We are, in truth, beginning to obtain some insight into one small spot
of that great zone of volcanic disturbance, the district around Naples; a
tract by no means remarkable for the violence of the earthquakes which
have convulsed it.</p>

<p>If, in this part of Campania, we are enabled to establish that considerable
changes in the relative level of land and sea have taken place since
the Christian era, it is all that we could have expected; and it is to recent
antiquarian and geological research, not to history, that we are
principally indebted for the information. I shall now proceed to lay
before the reader some of the results of modern investigations in the
Bay of Bai&aelig; and the adjoining coast.</p>

<h6>PROOFS OF ELEVATION AND SUBSIDENCE IN THE BAY OF BAI&AElig;.</h6>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 86.</span><a name="f86" id="f86"></a><img src="images/f86.png" width="550" height="352" alt="Ground plan of the coast of the Bay of Baiae, in the environs of Puzzuoli." title="" />

<p class="center2">Ground plan of the coast of the Bay of Bai&aelig;, in the environs of Puzzuoli</p></div>

<p><i>Temple of Jupiter Serapis.</i>&mdash;This celebrated monument of antiquity,
a representation of which is given in the frontispiece,<a name="FNanchor_711" id="FNanchor_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a> affords in itself
alone, unequivocal evidence that the relative level of land and sea has
changed twice at Puzzuoli since the Christian era; and each movement,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_508" id="Page_508">508</a></span>
both of elevation and subsidence, has exceeded twenty feet. Before
examining these proofs, I may observe, that a geological examination of
the coast of Bai&aelig;, both on the north and south of Puzzuoli, establishes,
in the most satisfactory manner, an elevation, at no remote period, of
more than twenty feet, and, at one point, of more than thirty feet; and
the evidence of this change would have been complete, if even the temple
had, to this day, remained undiscovered.</p>

<p><i>Coast south of Puzzuoli.</i>&mdash;If we coast along the shore from Naples
to Puzzuoli, we find, on approaching the latter place, that the lofty and
precipitous cliffs of indurated tuff, resembling that of which Naples is
built, retire slightly from the sea; and that a low level tract of fertile
land, of a very different aspect, intervenes between the present sea-beach
and what was evidently the ancient line of coast.</p>

<p>The inland cliff may be seen opposite the small island of Nisida, about
two miles and a half southeast of Puzzuoli (see Map, <a href="#f40">fig. 40</a>, p. 361),
where, at the height of thirty-two feet above the level of the sea, Mr.
Babbage observed an ancient mark, such as might have been worn by
the waves; and, upon farther examination, discovered that, along that
line, the face of the perpendicular rock, consisting of very hard tuff, was
covered with barnacles (<i>Balanus sulcatus</i>, Lamk.), and drilled by boring
testacea. Some of the hollows of the lithodomi contained the shells;

<span class="figleft" style="width: 250px;"><span class="center2">Fig.&nbsp;87.</span><a name="f87" id="f87"></a><img src="images/f87.png" width="250" height="215" alt="Antiquities on hill S. E. of Puzzuoli." title="" />

while others were filled with the valves of
a species of Area.<a name="FNanchor_712" id="FNanchor_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a> Nearer to Puzzuoli,
the inland cliff is eighty feet high, and as
perpendicular as if it was still undermined
by the waves. At its base, a new deposit,
constituting the fertile tract above alluded
to, attains a height of about twenty feet
above the sea; and, since it is composed
of regular sedimentary deposits, containing
marine shells, its position proves that, subsequently
to its formation, there has been a
change of more than twenty feet in the
relative level of land and sea.</p>

<p>The sea encroaches on these new incoherent strata; and as the soil is
valuable, a wall has been built for its protection; but when I visited the
spot in 1828, the waves had swept away part of this rampart, and exposed
to view a regular series of strata of tuff, more or less argillaceous,
alternating with beds of pumice and lapilli, and containing great abundance
of marine shells, of species now common on this coast, and amongst
them <i>Cardium rusticum</i>, <i>Ostrea edulis</i>, <i>Donax trunculus</i>, Lamk., and
others. The strata vary from about a foot to a foot and a half in thickness,
and one of them contains abundantly remains of works of art, tiles,
squares of mosaic pavement of different colors, and small sculptured ornaments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_510" id="Page_510">510</a></span>
perfectly uninjured. Intermixed with these I collected some
teeth of the pig and ox. These fragments of building occur below as
well as above strata containing marine shells. Puzzuoli itself stands
chiefly on a promontory of the older tufaceous formation, which cuts off
the new deposit, although I detected a small patch of the latter in a garden
under the town.</p>

<p>From the town the ruins of a mole, called Caligula's Bridge, run out
into the sea (see <a href="#f88">fig. 88</a>, p. 509).<a name="FNanchor_713" id="FNanchor_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a> This mole, which is believed to be
eighteen centuries old, consists of a number of piers and arches, thirteen
of which are now standing, and two others appear to have been overthrown.
Mr. Babbage found, on the sixth pier, perforations of lithodomi
four feet above the level of the sea; and, near the termination of
the mole on the last pier but one, marks of the same, ten feet above the
level of the sea, together with great numbers of balani and flustra. The
depth of the sea, at a very small distance from most of the piers, is
from thirty to fifty feet.</p>

<p><i>Coast north of Puzzuoli.</i>&mdash;If we then pass to the north of Puzzuoli,
and examine the coast between that town and Monte Nuovo, we find a
repetition of analogous phenomena. The sloping sides of Monte Barbaro
slant down within a short distance of the coast, and terminate in an
inland cliff of moderate elevation, to which the geologist perceives at
once that the sea must, at some former period, have extended. Between
this cliff and the sea is a low plain or terrace, called La Starza (<i>c</i>, <a href="#f89">fig. 89</a>),
corresponding to that before described on the southeast of the town;
and as the sea encroaches rapidly, fresh sections of the strata may readily
be obtained, of which the annexed is an example.</p>

The thickness of many of these beds varies greatly as we trace them
along the shore, and sometimes the whole group rises to a greater height
than at the point above described. The surface of the tract which
they compose appears to slope gently upwards towards the base of the
old cliffs.</p>

<p>Now, if such appearances presented themselves on the coast of England,
a geologist might endeavor to seek an explanation in some local
change in the set of the tides and currents: but there are scarce any
tides in the Mediterranean; and, to suppose the sea to have sunk generally
from twenty to twenty-five feet since the shores of Campania were
covered with sumptuous buildings is an hypothesis obviously untenable.
The observations, indeed, made during modern surveys on the moles
and cothons (docks) constructed by the ancients in various ports of the
Mediterranean, have proved that there has been no sensible variation of
level in that sea during the last two thousand years.<a name="FNanchor_715" id="FNanchor_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a></p>

<p>Thus we arrive, without the aid of the celebrated temple, at the conclusion,
that the recent marine deposit at Puzzuoli was upraised in
modern times above the level of the sea, and that not only this change
of position, but the accumulation of the modern strata, was posterior to
the destruction of many edifices, of which they contain the imbedded
remains. If we next examine the evidence afforded by the temple
itself, it appears, from the most authentic accounts, that the three pillars
now standing erect continued, down to the middle of the last century,
almost buried in the new marine strata (<i>c</i>, <a href="#f89">fig. 89</a>). The upper part of
each protruding several feet above the surface was concealed by bushes,
and had not attracted, until the year 1749, the notice of antiquaries;
but, when the soil was removed in 1750, they were seen to form part
of the remains of a splendid edifice, the pavement of which was still
preserved, and upon it lay a number of columns of African breccia and
of granite. The original plan of the building could be traced distinctly:
it was of a quadrangular form, seventy feet in diameter, and the roof
had been supported by forty-six noble columns, twenty-four of granite
and the rest of marble. The large court was surrounded by apartments,
supposed to have been used as bathing-rooms; for a thermal
spring, still used for medicinal purposes, issues just behind the building,
and the water of this spring appears to have been originally conveyed
by a marble duct, still extant, into the chambers, and then across the
pavement by a groove an inch or two deep, to a conduit made of Roman
brickwork, by which it gained the sea.</p>

<p>Many antiquaries have entered into elaborate discussions as to the
deity to which this edifice was consecrated. It is admitted that, among
other images found in excavating the ruins, there was one of the god
Serapis; and at Puzzuoli a marble column was dug up, on which was
carved an ancient inscription, of the date of the building of Rome 648
(or <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> 105), entitled "Lex parieti faciundo." This inscription, written
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_512" id="Page_512">512</a></span>
in very obscure Latin, sets forth a contract, between the municipality of
the town, and a company of builders who undertook to keep in repair
certain public edifices, the Temple of Serapis being mentioned amongst
the rest, and described as being near or towards the sea, "mare vorsum."
Sir Edmund Head, after studying, in 1828, the topography and antiquities
of this district, and the Greek, Roman, and Italian writers on the
subject, informed me, that at Alexandria, on the Nile, the chief seat of
the worship of Serapis, there was a Serapeum of the same form as this
temple at Puzzuoli, and surrounded in like manner by chambers, in
which the devotees were accustomed to pass the night, in the hope of
receiving during sleep a revelation from the god, as to the nature and
cure of their diseases. Hence it was very natural that the priests of
Serapis, a pantheistic divinity, who, among other usurpations, had appropriated
to himself the attributes of Esculapius, should regard the
hot spring as a suitable appendage to the temple, although the original
Serapeum of Alexandria could boast no such medicinal waters. Signor
Carelli<a name="FNanchor_716" id="FNanchor_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a> and others, in objecting to these views, have insisted on the
fact, that the worship of Serapis, which we know prevailed at Rome in
the days of Catullus (in the first century before Christ), was prohibited
by the Roman Senate, during the reign of the Emperor Tiberius. But
there is little doubt that, during the reigns of that emperor's successors,
the shrines of the Egyptian god were again thronged by zealous votaries;
and in no place more so than at Puteoli (now Puzzuoli), one of
the principal marts for the produce of Alexandria.</p>

<p>Without entering farther into an inquiry which is not strictly geological,
I shall designate this valuable relic of antiquity by its generally
received name, and proceed to consider the memorials of physical
changes inscribed on the three standing columns in most legible characters
by the hand of Nature. (See Frontispiece.) These pillars, which
have been carved each out of a single block of marble, are forty feet
three inches and a half in height. A horizontal fissure nearly intersects
one of the columns; the other two are entire. They are all
slightly out of the perpendicular, inclining somewhat to the southwest,
that is, towards the sea.<a name="FNanchor_717" id="FNanchor_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a> Their surface is smooth and uninjured to the
height of about twelve feet above their pedestals. Above this is a zone,
about nine feet in height, where the marble has been pierced by a species
of marine perforating bivalve&mdash;<i>Lithodomus</i>, Cuv.<a name="FNanchor_718" id="FNanchor_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a> The holes of
these animals are pear-shaped, the external opening being minute, and
gradually increasing downwards. At the bottom of the cavities, many
shells are still found, notwithstanding the great numbers that have been
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_513" id="Page_513">513</a></span>
taken out by visitors; in many the valves of a species of arca, an animal
which conceals itself in small hollows, occur. The perforations are
so considerable in depth and size, that they manifest a long-continued
abode of the lithodomi in the columns, for, as the inhabitant grows
older and increases in size, it bores a larger cavity, to correspond with
the increased magnitude of its shell. We must, consequently, infer a
long-continued immersion of the pillars in sea-water, at a time when the
lower part was covered up and protected by marine, fresh-water, and
volcanic strata, afterwards to be described, and by the rubbish of buildings;
the highest part, at the same time, projecting above the waters,
and being consequently weathered, but not materially injured. (See fig.
90, p. 514.)</p>

<p>On the pavement of the temple lie some columns of marble, which are
also perforated in certain parts; one, for example, to the length of eight
feet, while, for the length of four feet, it is uninjured. Several of these
broken columns are eaten into, not only on the exterior, but on the cross
fracture, and, on some of them, other marine animals (serpul&aelig;, &amp;c.) have
fixed themselves.<a name="FNanchor_719" id="FNanchor_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a> All the granite pillars are untouched by lithodomi.
The platform of the temple, which is not perfectly even, was, when I
visited it in 1828, about one foot below high-water mark (for there are
small tides in the bay of Naples); and the sea, which was only one hundred
feet distant, soaked through the intervening soil. The upper part
of the perforations, therefore, were at least twenty-three feet above highwater
mark; and it is clear that the columns must have continued for a
long time in an erect position, immersed in salt water, and then the submerged
portion must have been upraised to the height of about twenty-three
feet above the level of the sea.</p>

<p>By excavations carried on in 1828, below the marble pavement on
which the columns stand, another costly pavement of mosaic was found,
at the depth of about five feet below the upper one (<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <a href="#f90">fig. 90</a>). The
existence of these two pavements, at different levels, clearly implies some
subsidence previously to the building of the more modern temple which
had rendered it necessary to construct the new floor at a higher level.</p>

<p>We have already seen (p. 512) that a temple of Serapis existed long
before the Christian era. The change of level just mentioned must have
taken place some time before the end of the second century, for inscriptions
have been found in the temple, from which we learn that Septimius
Severus adorned its walls with precious marbles, between the years 194
and 211 of our era, and the emperor Alexander Severus displayed the
like munificence between the years 222 and 235.<a name="FNanchor_720" id="FNanchor_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a> From that era there
is an entire dearth of historical information for a period of more than
twelve centuries, except the significant fact that Alaric and his Goths
sacked Puzzuoli in 456, and that Genseric did the like in 545, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> Yet
we have fortunately a series of natural archives self-registered during the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_514" id="Page_514">514</a></span>
dark ages, by which many events which occurred in and about the temple
are revealed to us. These natural records consist partly of deposits,
which envelop the pillars below the zone of lithodomous perforations, and
partly of those which surround the outer walls of the temple. Mr.
Babbage, after a minute examination of these, has shown (see p. 507, <a href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">note</a>)
that incrustations on the walls of the exterior chambers and on the floor
of the building demonstrate that the pavement did not sink down suddenly,
but was depressed by a gradual movement. The sea first entered
the court or atrium and mingled its waters partially with those of the
hot spring. From this brackish medium a dark calcareous precipitate
(<i>c c</i>, <a href="#f90">fig. 90</a>) was thrown down, which became, in the course of time,
more than two feet thick, including some serpul&aelig; in it. The presence of
these annelids teaches us that the water was salt or brackish. After this
period the temple was filled up with an irregular mass of volcanic tuff
(<i>d d</i>, <a href="#f90">fig. 90</a>), probably derived from an eruption of the neighboring
crater of the Solfatara, to the height of from five to nine feet above the
pavement. Over this again a purely freshwater deposit of carbonate of
lime (<i>e e</i>, <a href="#f90">fig. 90</a>) accumulated with an <i>uneven</i> bottom since it necessarily
accommodated itself to the irregular outline of the upper surface of the
volcanic shower before thrown down. The top of the same deposit (a
freshwater limestone) was perfectly even and flat, bespeaking an ancient
water level. It is suggested by Mr. Babbage that this freshwater lake
may have been caused by the fall of ashes which choked up the channel
previously communicating with the sea, so that the hot spring threw
down calcareous matter in the atrium, without any marine intermixture.
To the freshwater limestone succeeded another irregular mass of volcanic
ashes and rubbish (<i>f f</i>, <a href="#f90">fig. 90</a>), some of it perhaps washed in by the
waves of the sea during a storm, its surface rising to ten or eleven feet
above the pavement. And thus we arrive at the period of greatest
depression expressed in the accompanying diagram, when the lower half
of the pillars were enveloped in the deposits above enumerated, and the
uppermost twenty feet were exposed in the atmosphere, the remaining
or middle portion, about nine feet long, being for years immersed in salt
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_515" id="Page_515">515</a></span>
water and drilled by perforating bivalves. After this period other strata,
consisting of showers of volcanic ashes and materials washed in during
storms, covered up the pillars to the height in some places of thirty-five
feet above the pavement. The exact time when these enveloping masses
were heaped up, and how much of them were formed during submergence,
and how much after the re-elevation of the temple, cannot be
made out with certainty.</p>

<p>The period of deep submergence was certainly antecedent to the close
of the fifteenth century. Professor James Forbes<a name="FNanchor_721" id="FNanchor_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a> has reminded us of
a passage in an old Italian writer Loffredo, who says that in 1530, or
fifty years before he wrote, which was in 1580, the sea washed the base
of the hills which rise from the flat land called La Starza, as represented
in <a href="#f90">fig. 90</a>, so that, to quote his words, "a person might then have fished
from the site of those ruins which are now called the stadium" (A,
<a href="#f90">fig. 90</a>).</p>

<p>But we know from other evidence that the upward movement had
begun before 1530, for the Canonico Andrea di Jorio cites two authentic
documents in illustration of this point. The first, dated Oct. 1503,
is a deed written in Italian, by which Ferdinand and Isabella grant to
the University of Puzzuoli a portion of land, "where the sea is drying
up" (che va seccando el mare); the second, a document in Latin, dated
May 23, 1511, or nearly eight years after, by which Ferdinand grants
to the city a certain territory around Puzzuoli, where the ground <i>is dried
up</i> from the sea (desiccatum).<a name="FNanchor_722" id="FNanchor_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a></p>

<p>The principal elevation, however, of the low tract unquestionably took
place at the time of the great eruption of Monte Nuovo in 1538. That
event and the earthquakes which preceded it have been already described
(p. 368); and we have seen that two of the eye-witnesses of the
convulsion, Falconi and Giacomo di Toledo, agree in declaring that the
sea abandoned a considerable tract of the shore, so that fish were taken
by the inhabitants; and, among other things, Falconi mentions that he
saw two springs <i>in the newly discovered ruins</i>.</p>

<p>The flat land, when first upraised, must have been more extensive than
now, for the sea encroaches somewhat rapidly, both to the north and
southeast of Puzzuoli. The coast had, when I examined it in 1828, given
way more than a foot in a twelvemonth; and I was assured, by fishermen
in the bay, that it has lost ground near Puzzuoli, to the extent of
thirty feet, within their memory.</p>

<p>It is, moreover, very probable that the land rose to a greater height
at first before it ceased to move upwards, than the level at which it was
observed to stand when the temple was rediscovered in 1749, for we
learn from a memoir, of Niccolini, published in 1838, that since the beginning
of the nineteenth century, the temple of Serapis has subsided
more than two feet. That learned architect visited the ruins frequently,
for the sake of making drawings, in the beginning of the year 1807, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_516" id="Page_516">516</a></span>
was in the habit of remaining there throughout the day, yet never saw
the pavement overflowed by the sea, except occasionally when the south
wind blew violently. On his return, sixteen years after, to superintend
some excavations ordered by the king of Naples, he found the pavement
covered by sea-water twice every day at high tide, so that he was
obliged to place there a line of stones to stand upon. This induced him
to make a series of observations from Oct. 1822 to July 1838, by which
means he ascertained that the ground had been and was sinking, at the
average rate of about seven millimetres a year, or about one inch in four
years; so that, in 1838, fish were caught every day on that part of the
pavement where, in 1807, there was never a drop of water in calm
weather.<a name="FNanchor_723" id="FNanchor_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a></p>

<p>On inquiring still more recently as to the condition of the temple and
the continuance of the sinking of the ground, I learn from Signor
Scacchi in a letter, dated June 1852, that the downward movement has
ceased for several years, or has at least become almost inappreciable.
During an examination undertaken by him at my request in the summer
of that year (1852), he observed that the rising tide spread first over the
seaward side of the flat surface of the pedestals of each column (confirming
the fact previously noticed by others, that they are out of the
perpendicular); and he also remarked that the water gained unequally
on the base of each pillar, in such a manner as to prove that they have
neither the same amount of inclination, nor lean precisely in the same
direction.</p>

<p>From what was said before (p. 510), we saw that the marine shells
in the strata forming the plain called La Starza, considered separately,
establish the fact of an upheaval of the ground to the height of twenty-three
feet and upwards. The temple proves much more, because it
could not have been built originally under water, and must therefore
first have sunk down twenty feet at least below the waves, to be afterwards
restored to its original position. Yet if such was the order of
events we ought to meet with other independent signs of a like subsidence
round the margin of a bay once so studded with buildings as the
Bay of Bai&aelig;. Accordingly memorials of such submergence are not
wanting. About a mile northwest of the temple of Serapis, and about
500 feet from the shore, are the ruins of a temple of Neptune and others
of a temple of the Nymphs, now underwater. The columns of the
former edifice stand erect in five feet of water, their upper portions just
rising to the surface of the sea. The pedestals are doubtless buried in
the sand or mud; so that, if this part of the bottom of the bay should
hereafter be elevated, the exhumation of these temples might take place
after the manner of that of Serapis. Both these buildings probably participated
in the movement which raised the Starza; but either they were
deeper under water than the temple of Serapis, or they were not raised
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_517" id="Page_517">517</a></span>
up again to so great a height. There are also two Roman roads under
water in the bay, one reaching from Puzzuoli to the Lucrine Lake, which
may still be seen, and the other near the castle of Bai&aelig; (No. 8, <a href="#f88">fig. 88</a>,
p. 509). The ancient mole, too, of Puzzuoli (No. 4, ibid.) before alluded
to, has the water up to a considerable height of the arches; whereas
Brieslak justly observes, it is next to certain that the piers must formerly
have reached the surface before the springing of the arches;<a name="FNanchor_724" id="FNanchor_724"></a><a href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a> so that,
although the phenomena before described prove that this mole has been
uplifted ten feet above the level at which it once stood, it is still evident
that it has not yet been restored to its original position.</p>

<p>A modern writer also reminds us, that these effects are not so local
as some would have us to believe; for on the opposite side of the Bay
of Naples, on the Sorrentine coast, which, as well as Puzzuoli, is subject
to earthquakes, a road, with some fragments of Roman buildings,
is covered to some depth by the sea. In the island of Capri, also,
which is situated some way out at sea, in the opening of the Bay of
Naples, one of the palaces of Tiberius is now covered with water.<a name="FNanchor_725" id="FNanchor_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a></p>

<p>That buildings should have been submerged, and afterwards upheaved,
without being entirely reduced to a heap of ruins, will appear
no anomaly, when we recollect that, in the year 1819, when the delta
of the Indus sank down, the houses within the fort of Sindree subsided
beneath the waves without being overthrown. In like manner, in the
year 1692, the buildings round the harbor of Port Royal, in Jamaica,
descended suddenly to the depth of between thirty and fifty feet under
the sea without falling. Even on small portions of land transported to
a distance of a mile down a declivity, tenements, like those near Mileto,
in Calabria, were carried entire. At Valparaiso buildings were left
standing in 1822, when their foundations, together with a long tract of
the Chilian coast, were permanently upraised to the height of several
feet. It is still more easy to conceive that an edifice may escape falling
during the upheaval or subsidence of land, if the walls are supported
on the exterior and interior with a deposit like that which surrounded
and filled to the height of ten or eleven feet the temple of Serapis all
the time it was sinking, and which enveloped it to more than twice
that height when it was rising again to its original level.</p>

<p>We can scarcely avoid the conclusion, as Mr. Babbage has hinted,
"that the action of heat is in some way or other the cause of the phenomena
of the change of level of the temple. Its own hot spring, its
immediate contiguity to the Solfatara, its nearness to the Monte Nuovo,
the hot spring at the baths of Nero (No. 6, <a href="#f88">fig. 88</a>), on the opposite
side of the Bay of Bai&aelig;; the boiling springs and ancient volcanoes of
Ischia on one side and Vesuvius on the other, are the most prominent
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_518" id="Page_518">518</a></span>
of a multitude of facts which point to that conclusion."<a name="FNanchor_726" id="FNanchor_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a> And when
we reflect on the dates of the principal oscillations of level, and the
volcanic history of the country before described (chap. 23), we seem to
discover a connection between each era of upheaval and a local development
of volcanic heat, and again between each era of depression and
the local quiescence or dormant condition of the subterranean igneous
causes. Thus for example, before the Christian era, when so many
vents were in frequent eruption in Ischia, and when Avernus and other
points in the Phlegr&aelig;an Fields were celebrated for their volcanic aspect
and character, the ground on which the temple stood was several feet
above water. Vesuvius was then regarded as a spent volcano; but
when, after the Christian era, the fires of that mountain were rekindled,
scarcely a single outburst was ever witnessed in Ischia, or around the
Bay of Bai&aelig;. Then the temple was sinking. Vesuvius, at a subsequent
period, became nearly dormant for five centuries preceding the great
outbreak of 1631 (see p. <a href="#Page_374">374</a>), and in that interval the Solfatara was
in eruption <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1198, Ischia in 1302, and Monte Nuovo was formed in
1538. Then the foundations on which the temple stood were rising
again. Lastly, Vesuvius once more became a most active vent, and has
been so ever since, and during the same lapse of time the area of the
temple, so far as we know any thing of its history, has been subsiding.</p>

<p>These phenomena would agree well with the hypothesis, that when
the subterranean heat is on the increase, and when lava is forming
without obtaining an easy vent, like that afforded by a great habitual
chimney, such as Vesuvius, the incumbent surface is uplifted; but when
the heated rocks below are cooling and contracting, and sheets of lava
are slowly consolidating and diminishing in volume, then the incumbent
land subsides.</p>

<p>Signor Niccolini, when he ascertained in 1838 that the relative levels
of the floor of the temple and of the sea were slowly changing from
year to year, embraced the opinion that it was the sea which was rising.
But Signor Capocci successfully controverted this view, appealing to
many appearances which attest the local character of the movements of
the adjoining country, besides the historical fact that in 1538, when
the sea retired permanently 200 yards from the ancient shore at Puzzuoli,
there was no simultaneous retreat of the waters from Naples,
Castelamare, and Ischia.<a name="FNanchor_727" id="FNanchor_727"></a><a href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a></p>

<p><i>Permanence of the ocean's level.</i>&mdash;In concluding this subject I may
observe, that the interminable controversies to which the phenomena of
the Bay of Bai&aelig; gave rise, have sprung from an extreme reluctance to
admit that the land, rather than the sea, is subject alternately to rise
and fall. Had it been assumed that the level of the ocean was invariable,
on the ground that no fluctuations have as yet been clearly established,
and that, on the other hand, the continents are inconstant in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_519" id="Page_519">519</a></span>
their level, as has been demonstrated by the most unequivocal proofs
again and again, from the time of Strabo to our own times, the appearances
of the temple at Puzzuoli could never have been regarded as
enigmatical. Even if contemporary accounts had not distinctly attested
the upraising of the coast, this explanation should have been proposed in
the first instance as the most natural, instead of being now adopted
unwillingly when all others have failed.</p>

<p>To the strong prejudices still existing in regard to the mobility of the
land, we may attribute the rarity of such discoveries as have been recently
brought to light in the Bay of Bai&aelig; and the Bay of Conception.
A false theory, it is well known, may render us blind to facts which are
opposed to our prepossessions, or may conceal from us their true import
when we behold them. But it is time that the geologist should, in
some degree, overcome those first and natural impressions, which induced
the poets of old to select the rock as the emblem of firmness&mdash;the sea
as the image of inconstancy. Our modern poet, in a more philosophical
spirit, saw in the sea "The image of eternity," and has finely contrasted
the fleeting existence of the successive empires which have flourished and
fallen on the borders of the ocean with its own unchanged stability.</p>

<p>We have now considered the phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes
according to the division of the subject before proposed (p. 345), and
have next to turn our attention to those slow and insensible changes in
the relative level of land and sea which take place in countries remote
from volcanoes, and where no violent earthquakes have occurred within
the period of human observation. Early in the last century the Swedish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_520" id="Page_520">520</a></span>
naturalist, Celsius, expressed his opinion that the waters, both of the
Baltic and Northern Ocean, were gradually subsiding. From numerous
observations, he inferred that the rate of depression was about fifty
Swedish inches in a century.<a name="FNanchor_728" id="FNanchor_728"></a><a href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a> In support of this position, he alleged
that there were many rocks both on the shores of the Baltic and the
ocean known to have been once sunken reefs, and dangerous to navigators,
but which were in his time above water&mdash;that the waters of the
Gulf of Bothnia had been gradually converted into land, several ancient
ports having been changed into inland cities, small islands joined to the
continent, and old fishing-grounds deserted as being too shallow, or entirely
dried up. Celsius also maintained, that the evidence of the change
rested not only on modern observations, but on the authority of the
ancient geographers, who had stated that Scandinavia was formerly an
island. This island, he argued, must in the course of centuries, by the
gradual retreat of the sea, have become connected with the continent;
an event which he supposed to have happened after the time of Pliny,
and before the ninth century of our era.</p>

<p>To this argument it was objected that the ancients were so ignorant
of the geography of the most northern parts of Europe, that their authority
was entitled to no weight; and that their representation of Scandinavia
as an island, might with more propriety be adduced to prove
the scantiness of their information, than to confirm so bold an hypothesis.
It was also remarked that if the land which connected Scandinavia
with the main continent was laid dry between the time of Pliny
and the ninth century, to the extent to which it is known to have risen
above the sea at the latter period, the rate of depression could not have
been uniform, as was pretended; for it ought to have fallen much more
rapidly between the ninth and eighteenth centuries.</p>

<p>Many of the proofs relied on by Celsius and his followers were immediately
controverted by several philosophers, who saw clearly that a
fall of the sea in any one region could not take place without a general
sinking of the waters over the whole globe: they denied that this was
the fact, or that the depression was universal, even in the Baltic. In
proof of the stability of the level of that sea, they appealed to the position
of the island of Saltholm, not far from Copenhagen. This island is
so low, that in autumn and winter it is permanently overflowed; and it
is only dry in summer, when it serves for pasturing cattle. It appears,
from the documents of the year 1280, that Saltholm was then also in
the same state, and exactly on a level with the mean height of the sea,
instead of having been about twenty feet under water, as it ought to
have been, according to the computation of Celsius. Several towns, also,
on the shores of the Baltic, as Lubeck, Wismar, Rostock, Stralsund, and
others, after six and even eight hundred years, are as little elevated
above the sea as at the era of their foundation, being now close to the
water's edge. The lowest part of Dantzic was no higher than the mean
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_521" id="Page_521">521</a></span>
level of the sea in the year 1000; and after eight centuries its relative
position remains exactly the same.<a name="FNanchor_729" id="FNanchor_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a></p>

<p>Several of the examples of the gain of land and shallowing of the sea
pointed out by Celsius, and afterwards by Linn&aelig;us, who embraced the
same opinions, were ascribed by others to the deposition of sediment at
points where rivers entered; and, undoubtedly, Celsius had not sufficiently
distinguished between changes due to these causes and such as
would arise if the waters of the ocean itself were diminishing. Many
large rivers descending from a mountainous country, at the head of the
Gulf of Bothnia, enter the sea charged with sand, mud, and pebbles;
and it was said that in these places the low land had advanced rapidly,
especially near Torneo. At Piteo also, half a mile had been gained in
forty-five years; at Luleo,<a name="FNanchor_730" id="FNanchor_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a> no less than a mile in twenty-eight years;
facts which might all be admitted consistently with the assumption that
the level of the Baltic has remained unchanged, like that of the Adriatic,
during a period when the plains of the Po and the Adige have greatly
extended their area.</p>

<p>It was also alleged that certain insular rocks, once entirely covered
with water, had at length protruded themselves above the waves, and
grown, in the course of a century and a half, to be eight feet high.
The following attempt was made to explain away this phenomenon:&mdash;In
the Baltic, large erratic blocks, as well as sand and smaller stones
which lie on shoals, are liable every year to be frozen into the ice, where
the sea freezes to the depth of five or six feet. On the melting of the
snow in spring, when the sea rises about half a fathom, numerous ice-islands
float away, bearing up these rocky fragments so as to convey
them to a distance; and if they are driven by the waves upon shoals,
they may convert them into islands by depositing the blocks; if stranded
upon low islands, they may considerably augment their height.</p>

<p>Browallius, also, and some other Swedish naturalists, affirmed that
some islands were lower than formerly; and that, by reference to this
kind of evidence, there was equally good reason for contending that the
level of the Baltic was gradually rising. They also added another
curious proof of the permanency of the water level, at some points at
least, for many centuries. On the Finland coast were some large pines,
growing close to the water's edge; these were cut down, and, by
counting the concentric rings of annual growth, as seen in a transverse
section of the trunk, it was demonstrated that they had stood there for
four hundred years. Now, according to the Celsian hypothesis, the
sea had sunk about fifteen feet during that period, in which case the
germination and early growth of these pines must have been, for many
seasons, below the level of the water. In like manner it was asserted,
that the lower walls of many ancient castles, such as those of Sonderburg
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_522" id="Page_522">522</a></span>
and &Aring;bo, reached then to the water's edge, and must, therefore,
according to the theory of Celsius, have been originally constructed
below the level of the sea.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 91.</span><a name="f91" id="f91"></a><img src="images/f91.png" width="450" height="808" alt="Map of Scandinavia." title="" /></div>

<p>In reply to this last argument, Colonel H&auml;llstrom, a Swedish engineer,
well acquainted with the Finland coast, assured me, that the base
of the walls of the castle of &Aring;bo is now ten feet above the water, so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_523" id="Page_523">523</a></span>
that there may have been a considerable rise of the land at that point
since the building was erected.</p>

<p>Playfair, in his "Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory," in 1802,
admitted the sufficiency of the proofs adduced by Celsius, but attributed
the change of level to the movement of the land, rather than to a
diminution of the waters. He observed, "that in order to depress or
elevate the absolute level of the sea, by a given quantity, in any one
place, we must depress or elevate it by the same quantity over the
whole surface of the earth; whereas no such necessity exists with respect
to the elevation or depression of the land."<a name="FNanchor_731" id="FNanchor_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a> The hypothesis of
the rising of the land he adds, "agrees well with the Huttonian theory,
which holds, that our continents are subject to be acted upon by the expansive
forces of the mineral regions; that by these forces they have been
actually raised up, and are sustained by them in their present situation.<a name="FNanchor_732" id="FNanchor_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a></p>

<p>In the year 1807, Von Buch, after returning from a tour in Scandinavia,
announced his conviction, "that the whole country, from Frederickshall
in Norway to &Aring;bo in Finland, and perhaps as far as St.
Petersburg, was slowly and insensibly rising." He also suggested
"that Sweden may rise more than Norway, and the northern more than
the southern part."<a name="FNanchor_733" id="FNanchor_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a> He was led to these conclusions principally by
information obtained from the inhabitants and pilots, and in part by the
occurrence of marine shells of recent species, which he had found at
several points on the coast of Norway above the level of the sea. He
also mentions the marks set on the rocks. Von Buch, therefore, has the
merit of being the first geologist who, after a personal examination of the
evidence, declared in favor of the rise of land in Scandinavia.</p>

<p>The attention excited by this subject in the early part of the last
century, induced many philosophers in Sweden to endeavor to determine,
by accurate observations, whether the standard level of the Baltic
was really subject to periodical variations; and under their direction,
lines or grooves, indicating the ordinary level of the water on a calm
day, together with the date of the year, were chiselled out upon the
rocks. In 1820-21, all the marks made before those years were examined
by the officers of the pilotage establishment of Sweden; and in
their report to the Royal Academy of Stockholm they declared, that
on comparing the level of the sea at the time of their observations with
that indicated by the ancient marks, they found that the Baltic was
lower relatively to the land in certain places, but the amount of change
during equal periods of time had not been everywhere the same. During
their survey, they cut new marks for the guidance of future observers,
several of which I had an opportunity of examining fourteen
years after (in the summer of 1834), and in that interval the land appeared
to me to have risen at certain places north of Stockholm four
or five inches. I also convinced myself, during my visit to Sweden,
after conversing with many civil engineers, pilots, and fishermen, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_524" id="Page_524">524</a></span>
after examining some of the ancient marks, that the evidence formerly
adduced in favor of the change of level, both on the coasts of Sweden
and Finland, was full and satisfactory.<a name="FNanchor_734" id="FNanchor_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a> The alteration of level evidently
diminishes as we proceed from the northern parts of the Gulf of
Bothnia towards the south, being very slight around Stockholm. Some
writers have indeed represented the rate of depression of the waters at
Stockholm as very considerable, because certain houses in that city
which are built on piles have sunk down within the memory of persons
still living, so as to be out of the perpendicular; and this in consequence
of the tops of the piles giving way and decaying, owing to a fall
of the waters which has exposed them to be alternately wet and dry.
The houses alluded to are situated on the borders of Lake Maeler, a
large lake, the outlet of which joins the Baltic, in the middle of Stockholm.
This lake is certainly lower than formerly; but the principal
cause of the change is not the elevation of the land, but the removal of
two old bridges built on piles, which formerly obstructed the discharge
of the fresh water into the sea. Another cause is the opening, in the
year 1819, of a new canal at S&ouml;dertelje, a place south of Stockholm, by
means of which a new line of communication was formed between Lake
Maeler and the Baltic.<a name="FNanchor_735" id="FNanchor_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a></p>

<p>It will naturally be asked, whether the mean level of a sea like the
Baltic can ever be determined so exactly as to permit us to appreciate
a variation of level, amounting only to one or two feet. In reply, I
may observe, that, except near the Cattegat, there are no tides in the
Baltic; and it is only when particular winds have prevailed for several
days in succession, or at certain seasons when there has been an unusually
abundant influx of river water, or when these causes have combined,
that this sea is made to rise two or three feet above its standard
level. The fluctuations due to these causes are nearly the same from
year to year; so that the pilots and fishermen believe and apparently
with reason, that they can mark a deviation, even of a few inches, from
the ordinary or mean height of the waters.</p>

<p>There are, moreover, peculiarities in the configuration of the shores
of Norway and Sweden, which facilitate in a remarkable degree the
appreciation of slight changes in the relative level of land and water.
It has often been said, that there are two coasts, an inner and an
outer one; the inner being the shore of the main land; the outer
one, a fringe of countless rocky islands of all dimensions, called the
sk&auml;r (<i>shair</i>). Boats and small vessels make their coasting voyages
within this sk&auml;r: for here they may sail in smooth water, even when
the sea without is strongly agitated. But the navigation is very intricate,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_525" id="Page_525">525</a></span>
and the pilot must possess a perfect acquaintance with the breadth
and depth of every narrow channel, and the position of innumerable
sunken rocks. If on such a coast the land rises one or two feet in the
course of half a century, the minute topography of the sk&auml;r is entirely
altered. To a stranger, indeed, who revisits it after an interval of many
years, its general aspect remains the same; but the inhabitant finds
that he can no longer penetrate with his boat through channels where
he formerly passed, and he can tell of countless other changes in the
height and breadth of isolated rocks, now exposed, but once only seen
through the clear water.</p>

<p>The rocks of gneiss, mica-schist, and quartz are usually very hard on
this coast, slow to decompose, and, when protected from the breakers,
remaining for ages unaltered in their form. Hence it is easy to mark
the stages of their progressive emergence by the aid of natural and artificial
marks imprinted on them. Besides the summits of <i>fixed</i> rocks,
there are numerous erratic blocks of vast size strewed over the shoals
and islands in the sk&auml;r, which have been probably drifted by ice in the
manner before suggested.<a name="FNanchor_736" id="FNanchor_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a> All these are observed to have increased
in height and dimension with the last half century. Some, which were
formerly known as dangerous sunken rocks, are now only hidden when
the water is highest. On their first appearance, they usually present a
smooth, bare, rounded protuberance, a few feet or yards in diameter;
and a single sea-gull often appropriates to itself this resting-place, resorting
there to devour its prey. Similar points, in the mean time, have
grown to long reefs, and are constantly whitened by a multitude of sea-fowl;
while others have been changed from a reef, annually submerged,
to a small islet, on which a few lichens, a fir-seedling, and a few blades
of grass, attest that the shoal has at length been fairly changed into dry
land. Thousands of wooded islands around show the great alterations
which time can work. In the course of centuries also, the spaces intervening
between the existing islands may be laid dry, and become grassy
plains encircled by heights well clothed with lofty firs. This last step
of the process, by which long fiords and narrow channels, once separating
wooded islands, are deserted by the sea, has been exemplified within the
memory of living witnesses on several parts of the coast.</p>

<p>Had the apparent fall of the waters been observed in the Baltic only,
we might have endeavored to explain the phenomenon by local causes
affecting that sea alone. For instance, the channel by which the Baltic
discharges its surplus waters into the Atlantic, might be supposed to
have been gradually widened and deepened by the waves and currents,
in which case a fall of the water like that before alluded to in Lake
Maeler, might have occurred. But the lowering of level would in that
case have been uniform and universal, and the waters could not have
sunk at Torneo, while they retained their former level at Copenhagen.
Such an explanation is also untenable on other grounds; for it is a fact,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_526" id="Page_526">526</a></span>
as Celsius long ago affirmed, that the alteration of level extends to the
western shores of Sweden, bordering the ocean. The signs of elevation
observed between Uddevalla and Gothenburg are as well established as
those on the shores of the Bothnian Gulf. Among the places where
they may be studied, are the islands of Marstrand and Gulholmen, the
last-mentioned locality being one of those particularly pointed out by
Celsius.</p>

<p>The inhabitants there and elsewhere affirm, that the rate of the sinking
of the sea (or elevation of land) varies in different and adjoining districts,
being greatest at points where the land is low. But in this they
are deceived; for they measure the amount of rise by the area gained,
which is most considerable where the land descends with a gentle slope
into the sea. In the same manner, some advocates of the Celsian theory
formerly appealed to the increase of lands near the mouths of rivers,
not sufficiently adverting to the fact, that if the bed of the sea is rising,
the change will always be most sensible where the bottom has been
previously rendered shallow; whereas, at a distance from these points
where the scarped granitic cliffs plunge at once into deep water, a much
greater amount of elevation is necessary to produce an equally conspicuous
change.</p>

<p>As to the area in northern Europe which is subject to this slow upheaving
movement, we have not as yet sufficient data for estimating it
correctly. It seems probable, however, that it reaches from Gothenburg
to Torneo, and from thence to the North Cape, the rate of elevation
increasing always as we proceed farther northwards. The two
extremities of this line are more than a thousand geographical miles
distant from each other; and as both terminate in the ocean, we know
not how much farther the motion may be prolonged under water. As
to the breadth of the tract, its limits are equally uncertain, though it
evidently extends across the widest parts of the Gulf of Bothnia, and
may probably stretch far into the interior, both of Sweden and Finland.
Now if the elevation continue, a larger part of the Gulf of Bothnia will
be turned into land, as also more of the ocean off the west coast of Sweden
between Gothenburg and Uddevalla; and on the other hand, if the
change has been going on for thousands of years at the rate of several
feet in a century, large tracts of what is now land must have been submarine
at periods comparatively modern. It is natural therefore to
inquire whether there are any signs of the recent sojourn of the sea on
districts now inland? The answer is most satisfactory.&mdash;Near Uddevalla
and the neighboring coastland, we find upraised deposits of shells
belonging to species such as now live in the ocean; while on the opposite
or eastern side of Sweden, near Stockholm, Gefle, and other places
bordering the Bothnian Gulf, there are analogous beds containing shells
of species characteristic of the Baltic.</p>

<p>Von Buch announced in 1807, that he had discovered in Norway and
at Uddevalla in Sweden, beds of shells of existing species, at considerable
heights above the sea. Since that time, other naturalists have confirmed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_527" id="Page_527">527</a></span>
his observation; and, according to Str&ouml;m, deposits occur at an elevation
of more than 400 feet above the sea in the northern part of Norway.
M. Alex. Brongniart, when he visited Uddevalla, ascertained that one of
the principal masses of shells, that of Capellbacken, is raised more than
200 feet above the sea, resting on rocks of gneiss, all the species being
identical with those now inhabiting the contiguous ocean. The same
naturalist also stated, that on examining with care the surface of the
gneiss, immediately above the ancient shelly deposit, he found barnacles
(<i>balani</i>) adhering to the rocks, showing that the sea had remained
there for a long time. I was fortunate enough to be able to verify this
observation by finding in the summer of 1834, at Kured, about two
miles north of Uddevalla, and at the height of more than 100 feet above
the sea, a surface of gneiss newly laid open by the partial removal of a
mass of shells used largely in the district for making lime and repairing
the roads. So firmly did these barnacles adhere to the gneiss, that I
broke off portions of the rock with the shells attached. The face of the
gneiss was also incrusted with small zoophytes (<i>Cellepora?</i> Lam.); but
had these or the barnacles been exposed in the atmosphere ever since the
elevation of the rocks above the sea, they would doubtless have decomposed
and been obliterated.</p>

<p>The town of Uddevalla (see Map, p. <a href="#Page_523">523</a>) stands at the head of a
narrow creek overhung by steep and barren rocks of gneiss, of which
all the adjacent country is composed, except in the low grounds and
bottoms of valleys, where strata of sand, clay, and marl frequently hide
the fundamental rocks. To these newer and horizontal deposits the
fossil shells above mentioned belong, and similar marine remains are
found at various heights above the sea on the opposite island of Orust.
The extreme distance from the sea to which such fossils extend is as yet
unknown; but they have been already found at Trollh&auml;ttan in digging
the canal there, and still farther inland on the northern borders of Lake
Wener, fifty miles from the sea, at an elevation of 200 feet near Lake
Rogvarpen.</p>

<p>To pass to the Baltic: I observed near its shores at S&ouml;dertelje, sixteen
miles S. W. of Stockholm, strata of sand, clay, and marl, more than
100 feet high, and containing shells of species now inhabiting the Bothnian
Gulf. These consist partly of marine and partly of freshwater species;
but they are few in number, the brackishness of the water appearing
to be very unfavorable to the development of testacea. The
most abundant species are the common cockle and the common mussel
and periwinkle of our shores (<i>Cardium edule</i>, <i>Mytilus edulis</i>, and <i>Littorina
littorea</i>), together with a small tellina (<i>T. Baltica</i>) and a few
minute univalves allied to <i>Paludina ulva</i>. These live in the same
water as a <i>Lymneus</i>, a Neritina (<i>N. fluviatilis</i>), and some other freshwater
shells.</p>

<p>But the marine mollusks of the Baltic above mentioned, although very
numerous in individuals, are dwarfish in size, scarcely ever attaining a
third of the average dimensions which they acquire in the salter waters of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_528" id="Page_528">528</a></span>
the ocean. By this character alone a geologist would generally be able
to recognize an assemblage of Baltic fossils as distinguished from those
derived from a deposit in the ocean. The absence also of oysters, barnacles,
whelks, scallops, limpets (<i>ostrea</i>, <i>balanus</i>, <i>buccinum</i>, <i>pecten</i>, <i>patella</i>),
and many other forms abounding alike in the sea near Uddevalla,
and in the fossiliferous deposits of modern date on that coast, supplies
an additional negative character of the greatest value, distinguishing
assemblages of Baltic from those of oceanic shells. Now the strata containing
Baltic shells are found in many localities near Stockholm, Upsala,
and Gefle, and will probably be discovered everywhere around the borders
of the Bothnian Gulf; for I have seen similar remains brought from
Finland, in marl resembling that found near Stockholm. The utmost
distance to which these deposits have yet been traced inland, is on the
southern shores of Lake Maeler, at a place seventy miles from the sea.<a name="FNanchor_737" id="FNanchor_737"></a><a href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a>
Hence it appears from the distinct assemblage of fossil shells found on
the eastern and western coasts of Sweden, that the Baltic has been for
a long period separated as now from the ocean, although the intervening
tract of land was once much narrower, even after both seas had become
inhabited by all the existing species of testacea.</p>

<p>As no accurate observations on the rise of the Swedish coast refer to
periods more remote than a century and a half from the present time,
and as traditional information, and that derived from ancient buildings
on the coast, do not enable the antiquary to trace back any monuments
of change for more than five or six centuries, we cannot declare whether
the rate of the upheaving force is uniform during very long periods.
In those districts where the fossil shells are found at the height of more
than 200 feet above the ocean, as at Uddevalla, Orust, and Lake Rogvarpen,
the present rate of rise seems less than four feet in a century.
Even at that rate it would have required five thousand years to lift up
those deposits. But as the movement is now very different in different
places, it may also have varied much in intensity at different eras.</p>

<p>We have, moreover, yet to learn not only whether the motion proceeds
always at the same rate, but also whether it has been uniformly <i>in
one direction</i>. The level of the land may oscillate; and for centuries there
may be a depression, and afterwards a re-elevation, of the same district.
Some phenomena in the neighborhood of Stockholm appear to me only
explicable on the supposition of the alternate rising and sinking of the
ground since the country was inhabited by man. In digging a canal,
in 1819, at S&ouml;dertelje, about sixteen miles to the south of Stockholm, to
unite Lake Maeler with the Baltic, marine strata, containing fossil shells
of Baltic species, were passed through. At a depth of about sixty feet,
they came down upon what seems to have been a buried fishing-hut,
constructed of wood in a state of decomposition, which soon crumbled
away on exposure to the air. The lowest part, however, which had stood
on a level with the sea, was in a more perfect state of preservation. On
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_529" id="Page_529">529</a></span>
the floor of this hut was a rude fireplace, consisting of a ring of stones,
and within this were cinders and charred wood. On the outside lay
boughs of the fir, cut as with an axe, with the leaves or needles still
attached. It seems very difficult to explain the position of this buried
hut, without imagining, as in the case of the temple of Serapis (see p.
<a href="#Page_486">486</a>), first a subsidence to the depth of more than sixty feet, then a reelevation.
During the period of submergence, the hut must have become
covered over with gravel and shelly marl, under which not only
the hut, but several vessels also were found, of a very antique form, and
having their timbers fastened together by wooden pegs instead of
nails.<a name="FNanchor_738" id="FNanchor_738"></a><a href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a></p>

<p>Whether any of the land in Norway is now rising, must be determined
by future investigations. Marine fossil shells, of recent species,
have been collected from inland places near Drontheim; but Mr. Everest,
in his "Travels through Norway," informs us that the small island
of Munkholm, which is an insulated rock in the harbor of Drontheim,
affords conclusive evidence of the land having in that region remained
stationary for the last eight centuries. The area of this isle does not
exceed that of a small village, and by an official survey, its highest
point has been determined to be twenty-three feet above the mean highwater
mark, that is, the mean between neap and spring tides. Now, a
monastery was founded there by Canute the Great, <span class="smcap">A. D.</span> 1028, and
thirty-three years before that time it was in use as a common place of
execution. According to the assumed average rate of rise in Sweden
(about forty inches in a century), we should be obliged to suppose that
this island had been three feet eight inches below high-water mark when
it was originally chosen as the site of the monastery.</p>

<p>Professor Keilhau of Christiania, after collecting the observations of
his predecessors respecting former changes of level in Norway, and combining
them with his own, has made the fact of a general change of level
at a modern period, that is to say, within the period of the actual testaceous
fauna, very evident. He infers that the whole country from Cape
Lindesn&aelig;s to Cape North, and beyond that as far as the fortress of
Vardhuus, has been gradually upraised, and on the southeast coast the
elevation has amounted to more than 600 feet. The marks which denote
the ancient coast-line are so nearly horizontal that the deviation
from horizontality, although the measurements have been made at a
great number of points, is too small to be appreciated.</p>

<p>More recently (1844), however, it appears from the researches of M.
Bravais, member of the French scientific commission of the North, that
in the Gulf of Alten in Finmark, the most northerly part of Norway,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_530" id="Page_530">530</a></span>
there are two distinct lines of upraised ancient sea-coast, one above the
other, which are not parallel, and both of them imply that within a distance
of fifty miles a considerable slope can be detected in such a direction
as to show that the ancient shores have undergone a greater amount
of upheaval in proportion as we advance inland.<a name="FNanchor_739" id="FNanchor_739"></a><a href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a></p>

<p>It has been already stated, that, in proceeding from the North Cape
to Stockholm, the rate of upheaval diminishes from several feet to a few
inches in a century. To the south of Stockholm, the upward movement
ceases, and at length in Scania, or the southernmost part of Sweden, it
appears to give place to a movement in an opposite direction. In proof
of this fact, Professor Nilsson observes, in the first place, that there are
no elevated beds of recent marine shells in Scania like those farther to
the north. Secondly, Linn&aelig;us, with a view of ascertaining whether the
waters of the Baltic were retiring from the Scanian shore, measured, in
1749, the distance between the sea and a large stone near Trelleborg.
This same stone was, in 1836, a hundred feet nearer the water's edge
than in Linn&aelig;us's time, or eighty-seven years before. Thirdly, there is
also a submerged peat moss, consisting of land and freshwater plants,
beneath the sea at a point to which no peat could have been drifted
down by any river. Fourthly, and what is still more conclusive, it is
found that in seaport towns, all along the coast of Scania, there are
streets below the high-water level of the Baltic, and in some cases below
the level of the lowest tide. Thus, when the wind is high at Malmo,
the water overflows one of the present streets, and some years ago some
excavations showed an ancient street in the same place eight feet lower,
and it was then seen that there had been an artificial raising of the
ground, doubtless in consequence of that subsidence. There is also a
street at Trelleborg, and another at Skan&ouml;r, a few inches below high-water
mark, and a street at Ystad is exactly on a level with the sea, at
which it could not have been originally built.</p>

<p>The inferences deduced from the foregoing facts are in perfect harmony
with the proofs brought to light by two Danish investigators, Dr.
Pingel and Captain Graah, of the sinking down of part of the west coast
of Greenland, for a space of more than 600 miles from north to south.
The observations of Captain Graah were made during a survey of
Greenland in 1823-24; and afterwards in 1828-29; those by Dr. Pingel
were made in 1830-32. It appears from various signs and traditions,
that the coast has been subsiding for the last four centuries from
the firth called Igaliko, in lat. 60&deg; 43' N. to Disco Bay, extending to
nearly the 69th degree of north latitude. Ancient buildings on low
rocky islands and on the shore of the main land have been gradually
submerged, and experience has taught the aboriginal Greenlander
never to build his hut near the water's edge. In one case the Moravian
settlers have been obliged more than once to move inland the poles upon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_531" id="Page_531">531</a></span>
which their large boats were set, and the old poles still remain beneath
the water as silent witnesses of the change.<a name="FNanchor_740" id="FNanchor_740"></a><a href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a></p>

<p>The probable cause of the movements above alluded to, whether of
elevation or depression, will be more appropriately discussed in the following
chapters, when the origin of subterranean heat is considered.
But I may remark here, that the rise of Scandinavia has naturally been
regarded as a very singular and scarcely credible phenomenon, because
no region on the globe has been more free within the times of authentic
history from violent earthquakes. In common, indeed, with our own
island and with almost every spot on the globe, some movements have
been, at different periods, experienced, both in Norway and Sweden.
But some of these, as for example during the Lisbon earthquake in 1755,
may have been mere vibrations or undulatory movements of the earth's
crust prolonged from a great distance. Others, however, have been sufficiently
local to indicate a source of disturbance immediately under the
country itself. Notwithstanding these shocks, Scandinavia has, upon
the whole, been as tranquil in modern times, and as free from subterranean
convulsions, as any region of equal extent on the globe. There
is also another circumstance which has made the change of level in
Sweden appear anomalous, and has for a long time caused the proofs of
the fact to be received with reluctance. Volcanic action, as we have
seen, is usually intermittent: and the variations of level to which it
has given rise have taken place by starts, not by a prolonged and
insensible movement similar to that experienced in Sweden. Yet, as
we enlarge our experience of modern changes, we discover instances
in which the volcanic eruption, the earthquake, and the permanent rise
or fall of land, whether slow or sudden, are all connected. The union
of these various circumstances was exemplified in the case of the temple
of Serapis, described in the last chapter, and we might derive other
illustrations from the events of the present century in South America.</p>

<p>Some writers, indeed, have imagined that there is geological evidence
in Norway, of the sudden upheaval of land to a considerable height
at successive periods, since the era when the sea was inhabited by the
living species of testacea. They point in proof to certain horizontal
lines of inland cliffs and sea-beaches containing recent shells at various
heights above the level of the sea.<a name="FNanchor_741" id="FNanchor_741"></a><a href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a> But these appearances, when truly
interpreted, simply prove that there have been long pauses in the process
of upheaval or subsidence. They mark eras at which the level of
the sea has remained stationary for ages, and during which new strata
were deposited near the shore in some places, while in others the
waves and currents had time to hollow out rocks, undermine cliffs,
and throw up long ranges of shingle. They undoubtedly show that
the movement has not been always uniform or continuous, but they do
not establish the fact of any sudden alterations of level.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_532" id="Page_532">532</a></span>
When we are once assured of the reality of the gradual rise of a
large region, it enables us to account for many geological appearances
otherwise of very difficult explanation. There are large continental tracts
and high table-lands where the strata are nearly horizontal, bearing no
marks of having been thrown up by violent convulsions, nor by a series
of movements, such as those which occur in the Andes, and cause the
earth to be rent open, and raised or depressed from time to time, while
large masses are engulfed in subterranean cavities. The result of a series
of such earthquakes might be to produce in a great lapse of ages a
country of shattered, inclined, and perhaps vertical strata. But a movement
like that of Scandinavia would cause the bed of the sea, and all
the strata recently formed in it, to be upheaved so gradually, that it
would merely seem as if the ocean had formerly stood at a higher level,
and had slowly and tranquilly sunk down into its present bed.</p>

<p>The fact also of a very gradual and insensible elevation of land may
explain many geological movements of denudation, on a grand scale.
If, for example, instead of the hard granitic rocks of Norway and Sweden,
a large part of the bed of the Atlantic, consisting chiefly of soft
strata, should rise up century after century, at the rate of about half an
inch, or an inch, in a year, how easily might oceanic currents sweep
away the thin film of matter thus brought up annually within the sphere
of aqueous denudation! The tract, when it finally emerged, might present
table-lands and ridges of horizontal strata, with intervening valleys
and vast plains, where originally, and during its period of submergence,
the surface was level and nearly uniform.</p>

<p>These speculations relate to superficial changes; but others must be
continually in progress in the subterranean regions. The foundations of
the country, thus gradually uplifted in Sweden, must be undergoing
important modifications. Whether we ascribe these to the expansion of
solid matter by continually increasing heat, or to the liquefaction of
rock, or to the crystallization of a dense fluid, or the accumulation of
pent-up gases, in whatever conjectures we indulge, we can never doubt
for a moment, that at some unknown depth beneath Sweden and the
Baltic, the structure of the globe is in our own times becoming changed
from day to day, throughout a space probably more than a thousand
miles in length, and several hundred in breadth.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXXI.</h4>

<h6>CAUSES OF EARTHQUAKES AND VOLCANOES.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Intimate connection between the causes of volcanoes and earthquakes&mdash;Supposed
original state of fusion of the planet&mdash;Universal fluidity not proved by spheroidal
figure of the earth&mdash;Attempt to calculate the thickness of the solid crust
of the earth by precessional motion&mdash;Heat in mines increasing with the depth&mdash;Objections

earth's crust.</p></div>

<p>It will hardly be questioned, after the description before given of the
phenomena of earthquakes and volcanoes, that both of these agents have,
to a certain extent, a common origin; and I may now, therefore, proceed
to inquire into their probable causes. But first, it may be well to
recapitulate some of those points of relation and analogy which lead
naturally to the conclusion that they spring from a common source.</p>

<p>The regions convulsed by violent earthquakes include within them
the site of all the active volcanoes. Earthquakes, sometimes local, sometimes
extending over vast areas, often precede volcanic eruptions. The
subterranean movement and the eruption return again and again, at
irregular intervals of time, and with unequal degrees of force, to the
same spots. The action of either may continue for a few hours, or for
several consecutive years. Paroxysmal convulsions are usually followed,
in both cases, by long periods of tranquillity. Thermal and mineral
springs are abundant in countries of earthquakes and active volcanoes.
Lastly, hot springs situated in districts considerably distant from volcanic
vents have been observed to have their temperature suddenly
raised, and the volume of their water augmented, by subterranean movements.</p>

<p>All these appearances are evidently more or less connected with the
passage of heat from the interior of the earth to the surface; and where
there are active volcanoes, there must exist, at some unknown depth below,
enormous masses of matter intensely heated, and, in many instances,
in a constant state of fusion. We have first, then, to inquire, whence is
this heat derived?</p>

<p>It has long been a favorite conjecture, that the whole of our planet
was originally in a state of igneous fusion, and that the central parts
still retain a great portion of their primitive heat. Some have imagined,
with the late Sir W. Herschel, that the elementary matter of the earth
may have been first in a gaseous state, resembling those nebul&aelig; which
we behold in the heavens, and which are of dimensions so vast, that some
of them would fill the orbits of the remotest planets of our system. The
increased power of the telescope has of late years resolved the greater
number of these nebulous appearances into clusters of stars, but so long
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_534" id="Page_534">534</a></span>
as they were confidently supposed to consist of aeriform matter it was a
favorite conjecture that they might, if concentrated, form solid spheres;
and it was also imagined that the evolution of heat, attendant on condensation,
might retain the materials of the new globes in a state of
igneous fusion.</p>

<p>Without dwelling on such speculations, which can only have a distant
bearing on geology, we may consider how far the spheroidal form
of the earth affords sufficient ground for presuming that its primitive
condition was one of universal fluidity. The discussion of this question
would be superfluous, were the doctrine of original fluidity less popular;
for it may well be asked, why the globe should be supposed to have
had a pristine shape different from the present one?&mdash;why the terrestrial
materials, when first called into existence, or assembled together
in one place, should not have been subject to rotation, so as to
assume at once that form which alone could retain their several parts in
a state of equilibrium?</p>

<p>Let us, however, concede that the statical figure may be a modification
of some other pre-existing form, and suppose the globe to have been
at first a perfect and quiescent sphere, covered with a uniform ocean&mdash;what
would happen when it was made to turn round on its axis with its
present velocity? This problem has been considered by Playfair in his
Illustrations, and he has decided, that if the surface of the earth, as laid
down in Hutton's theory, has been repeatedly changed by the transportation
of the detritus of the land to the bottom of the sea, the figure of
the planet must in that case, whatever it may have been originally, be
brought at length to coincide with the spheroid of equilibrium.<a name="FNanchor_742" id="FNanchor_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a> Sir
John Herschel also, in reference to the same hypothesis, observes, "a
centrifugal force would in that case be generated, whose general tendency
would be to urge the water at every point of the surface to <i>recede</i>
from the <i>axis</i>. A rotation might indeed be conceived so swift as to flirt
the whole ocean from the surface, like water from a mop. But this would
require a far greater velocity than what we now speak of. In the case
supposed, the <i>weight</i> of the water would still keep it <i>on</i> the earth; and
the tendency to recede from the axis <i>could</i> only be satisfied therefore by
the water leaving the poles, and flowing towards the equator; there
heaping itself up in a ridge, and being retained in opposition to its weight
or natural tendency towards the centre by the pressure thus caused.
This, however, could not take place without laying dry the polar regions,
so that protuberant land would appear at the poles, and a zone of ocean
be disposed around the equator. This would be the first or immediate
effect. Let us now see what would afterwards happen if things were
allowed to take their natural course.</p>

<p>"The sea is constantly beating on the land, grinding it down, and
scattering its worn-off particles and fragments, in the state of sand and
pebbles, over its bed. Geological facts afford abundant proof that the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_535" id="Page_535">535</a></span>
existing continents have all of them undergone this process even more
than once, and been entirely torn in fragments, or reduced to powder,
and submerged and reconstructed. Land, in this view of the subject,
loses its attribute of fixity. As a mass it might hold together in opposition
to forces which the water freely obeys; but in its state of successive
or simultaneous degradation, when disseminated through the water,
in the state of sand or mud, it is subject to all the impulses of that fluid.
In the lapse of time, then, the protuberant land would be destroyed, and
spread over the bottom of the ocean, filling up the lower parts, and tending
continually to remodel the surface of the solid nucleus, in correspondence
with the <i>form of equilibrium</i>. Thus after a sufficient lapse of
time, in the case of an earth in rotation, the polar protuberances would
gradually be cut down and disappear, being transferred to the equator
(as being <i>then</i> the <i>deepest sea</i>), till the earth would assume by degrees
the form we observe it to have&mdash;that of a flattened or <i>oblate</i>
ellipsoid.</p>

<p>"We are far from meaning here to trace the process <i>by which</i> the
earth really assumed its actual form; all we intend is to show that this
is the form to which, under a condition of a rotation on its axis, it must
<i>tend</i>, and which it would attain even if originally and (so to speak) perversely
constituted otherwise."<a name="FNanchor_743" id="FNanchor_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a></p>

<p>In this passage, the author has contemplated the superficial effects of
aqueous causes only; but neither he nor Playfair seem to have followed
out the same inquiry with reference to another part of Hutton's system;
namely, that which assumes the successive fusion by heat of different
parts of the solid earth. Yet the progress of geology has continually
strengthened the evidence in favor of the doctrine that local variations of
temperature have melted one part after another of the earth's crust, and
this influence has perhaps extended downwards to the very centre. If,
therefore, before the globe had assumed its present form, it was made
to revolve on its axis, all matter to which freedom of motion was given
by fusion, must before consolidating have been impelled towards the
equatorial regions in obedience to the centrifugal force. Thus lava flowing
out in superficial streams would have its motion retarded when its
direction was towards the pole, accelerated when towards the equator;
or if lakes and seas of lava existed beneath the earth's crust in equatorial
regions, as probably now beneath the Peruvian Andes, the imprisoned
fluid would force outwards and permanently upheave the overlying
rocks. The statical figure, therefore, of the terrestrial spheroid
(of which the longest diameter exceeds the shortest by about twenty-five
miles), may have been the result of gradual and even of existing causes,
and not of a primitive, universal, and simultaneous fluidity.<a name="FNanchor_744" id="FNanchor_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a></p>

<p>Experiments made with the pendulum, and observations on the manner
in which the earth attracts the moon, have shown that our planet is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_536" id="Page_536">536</a></span>
not an empty sphere, but, on the contrary, that its interior, whether
solid or fluid, has a higher specific gravity than the exterior. It has
also been inferred, that there is a regular increase in density from the
surface towards the centre, and that the equatorial protuberance is continued
inwards; that is to say, that layers of equal density are arranged
elliptically, and symmetrically, from the exterior to the centre. These
conclusions, however, have been deduced rather as a consequence of
the hypothesis of primitive and simultaneous fluidity than proved by
experiment. The inequalities in the moon's motion, by which some have
endeavored to confirm them, are so extremely slight, that the opinion
can be regarded as little more than a probable conjecture.</p>

<p>The mean density of the earth has been computed by Laplace to be
about 5&frac12;, or more than five times that of water. Now the specific
gravity of many of our rocks is from 2&frac12; to 3, and the greater part of
the metals range between that density and 21. Hence some have
imagined that the terrestrial nucleus may be metallic&mdash;that it may correspond,
for example, with the specific gravity of iron, which is about 7.
But here a curious question arises in regard to the form which materials,
whether fluid or solid, might assume, if subjected to the enormous
pressure which must obtain at the earth's centre. Water, if it continued
to decrease in volume according to the rate of compressibility deduced
from experiment, would have its density doubled at the depth of ninety-three
miles, and be as heavy as mercury at the depth of 362 miles.
Dr. Young computed that, at the earth's centre, steel would be compressed
into one-fourth, and stone into one-eighth of its bulk.<a name="FNanchor_745" id="FNanchor_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a> It is
more than probable, however, that after a certain degree of condensation,
the compressibility of bodies may be governed by laws altogether
different from those which we can put to the test of experiment; but
the limit is still undetermined, and the subject is involved in such obscurity,
that we cannot wonder at the variety of notions which have
been entertained respecting the nature and conditions of the central nucleus.
Some have conceived it to be fluid, others solid; some have
imagined it to have a cavernous structure, and have even endeavored to
confirm this opinion by appealing to observed irregularities in the vibrations
of the pendulum in certain countries.</p>

<p>An attempt has recently been made by Mr. Hopkins to determine
the least thickness which can be assigned to the solid crust of the globe,
if we assume the whole to have been once perfectly fluid, and a certain
portion of the exterior to have acquired solidity by gradual refrigeration.
This result he has endeavored to obtain by a new solution of the delicate
problem of the processional motion of the pole of the earth. It is
well known that while the earth revolves round the sun the direction of
its axis remains very nearly the same, <i>i. e.</i> its different positions in space
are all nearly parallel to each other. This parallelism, however, is not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_537" id="Page_537">537</a></span>
accurately preserved, so that the axis, instead of coming exactly into
the position which it occupied a year before, becomes inclined to it at a
very small angle, but always retaining very nearly the same inclination
to the plane of the earth's orbit. This motion of the pole changes the
position of the equinoxes by about fifty seconds annually, and always
in the same direction. Thus the pole-star, after a certain time, will
entirely lose its claim to that appellation, until in the course of somewhat
more than 25,000 years the earth's axis shall again occupy its present
angular position, and again point very nearly as now to the pole-star.
This motion of the axis is called <i>precession</i>. It is caused by the attraction
of the sun and moon, and principally the moon, on the protuberant
parts of the earth's equator; and if these parts were solid to a great
depth, the motion thus produced would differ considerably from that
which would exist if they were perfectly fluid, and incrusted over with
a thin shell only a few miles thick. In other words, the disturbing action
of the moon will not be the same upon a globe all solid and upon
one nearly all fluid, or it will not be the same upon a globe in which
the solid shell forms one-half of the mass, and another in which it forms
only one-tenth.</p>

<p>Mr. Hopkins has, therefore, calculated the amount of precessional motion
which would result if we assume the earth to be constituted as
above stated; <i>i. e.</i> fluid internally, and enveloped by a solid shell; and
he finds that the amount will not agree with the observed motion, unless
the crust of the earth be of a certain thickness. In calculating the exact
amount some ambiguity arises in consequence of our ignorance of the
effect of pressure in promoting the solidification of matter at high temperatures.
The hypothesis least favorable for a great thickness is found
to be that which assumes the pressure to produce no effect on the process
of solidification. Even on this extreme assumption the thickness of
the solid crust must be nearly <i>four hundred miles</i>, and this would lead
to the remarkable result that the proportion of the solid to the fluid part
would be as 49 to 51, or, to speak in round numbers, there would be
nearly as much solid as fluid matter in the globe. The conclusion, however,
which Mr. Hopkins announces as that to which his researches
have finally conducted him, is thus expressed: "Upon the whole, then,
we may venture to assert that the minimum thickness of the crust of the
globe, which can be deemed consistent with the observed amount of precession,
cannot be less than one-fourth or one-fifth of the earth's radius."
That is from 800 to 1000 miles.<a name="FNanchor_746" id="FNanchor_746"></a><a href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a></p>

<p>It will be remarked, that this is a <i>minimum</i>, and any still <i>greater</i>
amount would be quite consistent with the actual phenomena; the calculations
not being opposed to the supposition of the general solidity of the
entire globe. Nor do they preclude us from imagining that great lakes
or seas of melted matter may be distributed through a shell 400 or 800
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_538" id="Page_538">538</a></span>
miles thick, provided they be so inclosed as to move with it, whatever
motion of rotation may be communicated by the disturbing forces of the
sun and moon.</p>

<p><i>Central heat.</i>&mdash;The hypothesis of internal fluidity calls for the more
attentive consideration, as it has been found that the heat in mines augments
in proportion as we descend. Observations have been made, not
only on the temperature of the air in mines, but on that of the rocks,
and on the water issuing from them. The mean rate of increase, calculated
from results obtained in six of the deepest coal mines in Durham
and Northumberland, is 1&deg; Fahr. for a descent of forty-four English
feet.<a name="FNanchor_747" id="FNanchor_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a> A series of observations, made in several of the principal lead
and silver mines in Saxony, gave 1&deg; Fahr. for every sixty-five feet. In
this case, the bulb of the thermometer was introduced into cavities purposely
cut in the solid rock at depths varying from 200 to above 900 feet.
But in other mines of the same country, it was necessary to descend
thrice as far for each degree of temperature.<a name="FNanchor_748" id="FNanchor_748"></a><a href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a></p>

<p>A thermometer was fixed in the rock of the Dolcoath mine, in Cornwall,
by Mr. Fox, at the great depth of 1380 feet, and frequently observed
during eighteen months; the mean temperature was 68&deg; Fahr.,
that of the surface being 50&deg;, which gives 1&deg; for every seventy-five feet.</p>

<p>Kupffer, after an extensive comparison of the results in different countries,
makes the increase 1&deg; F. for about every thirty-seven English feet.<a name="FNanchor_749" id="FNanchor_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a>
M. Cordier announces, as the result of his experiments and observations
on the temperature of the interior of the earth, that the heat increases
rapidly with the depth; but the increase does not follow the same law
over the whole earth, being twice or three times as much in one country
as in another, and these differences are not in constant relation either
with the latitudes or longitudes of places.<a name="FNanchor_750" id="FNanchor_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a> He is of opinion, however,
that the increase would not be overstated at 1&deg; Cent. for every twenty-five
metres, or about 1&deg; F. for every forty-five feet.<a name="FNanchor_751" id="FNanchor_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a> The experimental
well bored at Grenelle, near Paris, gave about 1&deg; F. for every sixty
English feet, when they had reached a depth of 1312 feet.</p>

<p>Some writers have endeavored to refer these phenomena (which, however
discordant as to the ratio of increasing heat, appear all to point one
way) to the condensation of air constantly descending from the surface
into the mines. For the air under pressure would give out latent heat,
on the same principle as it becomes colder when rarefied in the higher
regions of the atmosphere. But, besides that the quantity of heat is
greater than could be supposed to flow from this source, the argument
has been answered in a satisfactory manner by Mr. Fox, who has shown,
that in the mines of Cornwall the ascending have generally a higher
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_539" id="Page_539">539</a></span>
temperature than the descending aerial currents. The difference between
them was found to vary from 9&deg; to 17&deg; F.; a proof that, instead
of imparting heat, these currents actually carry off a large quantity from
the mines.<a name="FNanchor_752" id="FNanchor_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a></p>

<p>If we adopt M. Cordier's estimate of 1&deg; F. for every 45 feet of depth
as the mean result, and assume, with the advocates of central fluidity,
that the increasing temperature is continued downwards, we should
reach the ordinary boiling point of water at about two miles below the
surface, and at the depth of about twenty-four miles should arrive at
the melting point of iron, a heat sufficient to fuse almost every known
substance. The temperature of melted iron was estimated at 21,000&deg;
F., by Wedgwood; but his pyrometer gives, as is now demonstrated,
very erroneous results. Professor Daniell ascertained that the point of
fusion is 2,786&deg; F.<a name="FNanchor_753" id="FNanchor_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor">753</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 92.</span><a name="f92" id="f92"></a><img src="images/f92.png" width="500" height="508" alt="Section of the earth." title="" />

<p class="center2">Section of the earth, in which the breadth of the outer boundary line represents a thickness of
25 miles; the space between the circles, including the breadth of the lines, 200 miles.</p></div>

<p>According to Mr. Daniell's scale, we ought to encounter the internal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_540" id="Page_540">540</a></span>
melted matter before penetrating through a thickness represented by
that of the outer circular line in the annexed diagram (<a href="#f92">fig. 92</a>); whereas,
if the other or less correct scale be adopted, we should meet with it at
some point between the two circles; the space between them, together
with the lines themselves, representing a crust of 200 miles in depth.
In either case, we must be prepared to maintain that a temperature
many times greater than that sufficient to melt the most refractory substances
known to us, is sustained at the centre of the globe; while a
comparatively thin crust, resting upon the fluid, remains unmelted; or
is even, according to M. Cordier, increasing in thickness, by the continual
addition of new internal layers solidified during the process of refrigeration.</p>

<p>The mathematical calculations of Fourier, on the passage of heat
through conducting bodies, have been since appealed to in support of
these views; for he has shown that it is compatible with theory that
the present temperature of the surface might coexist with an intense
heat at a certain depth below. But his reasoning seems to be confined
to the conduction of heat through solid bodies; and the conditions of
the problem are wholly altered when we reason about a fluid nucleus, as
we must do if it be assumed that the heat augments from the surface
to the interior, according to the rate observed in mines. For when the
heat of the lower portion of a fluid is increased, a circulation begins
throughout the mass, by the ascent of hotter, and the descent of colder
currents. And this circulation, which is quite distinct from the mode
in which heat is propagated through solid bodies, must evidently occur
in the supposed central ocean, if the laws of fluids and of heat are the
same there as upon the surface.</p>

<p>In Mr. Daniell's experiments for obtaining a measure of the heat of
bodies at their point of fusion, he invariably found that it was impossible
to raise the heat of a large crucible of melted iron, gold, or silver, a single
degree beyond the melting point, so long as a bar of the respective
metals was kept immersed in the fluid portions. So in regard to other
substances, however great the quantities fused, their temperature could
not be raised while any solid pieces immersed in them remained unmelted;
every accession of heat being instantly absorbed during their
liquefaction. These results are, in fact, no more than the extension of a
principle previously established, that so long as a fragment of ice remains
in water, we cannot raise the temperature of the water above
32&deg; F.</p>

<p>If, then, the heat of the earth's centre amount to 450,000&deg; F., as M.
Cordier deems highly probable, that is to say, about twenty times the
heat of melted iron, even according to Wedgwood's scale, and upwards
of 160 times according to the improved pyrometer, it is clear that the
upper parts of the fluid mass could not long have a temperature only
just sufficient to melt rocks. There must be a continual tendency towards
a uniform heat; and until this were accomplished, by the interchange
of portions of fluid of different densities, the surface could not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_541" id="Page_541">541</a></span>
begin to consolidate. Nor, on the hypothesis of primitive fluidity, can
we conceive any crust to have been formed until <i>the whole</i> planet had
cooled down to about the temperature of incipient fusion.</p>

<p>It cannot be objected that hydrostatic pressure would prevent a tendency
to equalization of temperature; for, as far as observations have
yet been made, it is found that the waters of deep lakes and seas are
governed by the same laws as a shallow pool; and no experiments indicate
that solids resist fusion under high pressure. The arguments, indeed,
now controverted, always proceed on the admission that the internal
nucleus is in a state of fusion.</p>

<p>It may be said that we may stand upon the hardened surface of a lava-current
while it is still in motion,&mdash;nay, may descend into the crater of
Vesuvius after an eruption, and stand on the scori&aelig; while every crevice
shows that the rock is red-hot two or three feet below us; and at a
somewhat greater depth, all is, perhaps, in a state of fusion. May not,
then, a much more intense heat be expected at the depth of several
hundred yards, or miles? The answer is,&mdash;that until a great quantity
of heat has been given off, either by the emission of lava, or in a latent
form by the evolution of steam and gas, the melted matter continues to
boil in the crater of a volcano. But ebullition ceases when there is no
longer a sufficient supply of heat from below, and then a crust of lava
may form on the top, and showers of scori&aelig; may then descend upon
the surface, and remain unmelted. If the internal heat be raised again,
ebullition will recommence, and soon fuse the superficial crust. So in
the case of the moving current, we may safely assume that no part of
the liquid beneath the hardened surface is much above the temperature
sufficient to retain it in a state of fluidity.</p>

<p>It may assist us in forming a clearer view of the doctrine now controverted,
if we consider what would happen were a globe of homogeneous
composition placed under circumstances analogous, in regard to
the distribution of heat, to those above stated. If the whole planet, for
example, were composed of water covered with a spheroidal crust of ice
fifty miles thick, and with an interior ocean having a central heat about
two hundred times that of the melting point of ice, or 6400&deg; F.; and if,
between the surface and the centre, there was every intermediate degree
of temperature between that of melting ice and that of the central nucleus&mdash;could
such a state of things last for a moment? If it must be
conceded, in this case, that the whole spheroid would be instantly in a
state of violent ebullition, that the ice (instead of being strengthened
annually by new internal layers) would soon melt, and form part of an
atmosphere of steam&mdash;on what principle can it he maintained that analogous
effects would not follow, in regard to the earth, under the conditions
assumed in the theory of central heat?<a name="FNanchor_754" id="FNanchor_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor">754</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_542" id="Page_542">542</a></span>M. Cordier admits that there must be tides in the internal melted
ocean; but their effect, he says, has become feeble, although originally,
when the fluidity of the globe was perfect, "the rise and fall of these
ancient land tides could not have been less than from thirteen to sixteen
feet." Now, granting for a moment, that these tides have become so
feeble as to be incapable of causing the fissured shell of the earth to be
first uplifted and then depressed every six hours, still may we not ask
whether, during eruptions, the lava, which is supposed to communicate
with a great central ocean, would not rise and fall sensibly in a crater
such as Stromboli, where there is always melted matter in a state of
ebullition?</p>

<p><i>Whether chemical changes may produce volcanic heat.</i>&mdash;Having now
explained the reasons which have induced me to question the hypothesis
of central heat as the primary source of volcanic action, it remains to
consider what has been termed the chemical theory of volcanoes. It is
well known that many, perhaps all, of the substances of which the earth
is composed are continually undergoing chemical changes. To what
depth these processes may be continued downwards must, in a great
degree, be matter of conjecture; but there is no reason to suspect that,
if we could descend to a great distance from the surface, we should find
elementary substances differing essentially from those with which we are
acquainted.</p>

<p>All the solid, fluid, and gaseous bodies known to us consist of a very
small number of these elementary substances variously combined: the
total number of elements at present known is less than sixty; and not
half of these enter into the composition of the more abundant inorganic
productions. Some portions of such compounds are daily undergoing
decomposition, and their constituent parts being set free are passing into
new combinations. These processes are by no means confined to minerals
at the earth's surface, and are very often accompanied by the evolution
of heat, which is intense in proportion to the rapidity of the combinations.
At the same time there is a development of electricity.</p>

<p>The spontaneous combustion of beds of bituminous shale, and of refuse
coal thrown out of mines, is generally due to the decomposition of pyrites;
and it is the contact of air and water which brings about the change.
Heat results from the oxidation of the sulphur and iron, though on what
principle heat is generated, when two or more bodies having a strong
affinity for each other unite suddenly, is wholly unexplained.</p>

<p><i>Electricity a source of volcanic heat.</i>&mdash;It has already been stated, that
chemical changes develop electricity; which, in its turn, becomes a
powerful disturbing cause. As a chemical agent, says Davy, its silent
and slow operation in the economy of nature is much more important
than its grand and impressive operation in lightning and thunder. It
may be considered, not only as directly producing an infinite variety of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_543" id="Page_543">543</a></span>
changes, but as influencing almost all which take place; it would seem,
indeed, that chemical attraction itself is only a peculiar form of the exhibition
of electrical attraction.<a name="FNanchor_755" id="FNanchor_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor">755</a></p>

<p>Now that it has been demonstrated that magnetism and electricity
are always associated, and are perhaps only different conditions of the
same power, the phenomena of terrestrial magnetism have become of
no ordinary interest to the geologist. Soon after the first great discoveries
of Oersted in electro-magnetism, Amp&egrave;re suggested that all
the phenomena of the magnetic needle might be explained by supposing
currents of electricity to circulate constantly in the shell of the
globe in directions parallel to the magnetic equator. This theory has
acquired additional consistency the farther we have advanced in science;
and according to the experiments of Mr. Fox, on the electro-magnetic
properties of metalliferous veins, some trace of electric currents seems to
have been detected in the interior of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_756" id="FNanchor_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_756" class="fnanchor">756</a></p>

<p>Some philosophers ascribe these currents to the chemical action going
on in the superficial parts of the globe to which air and water have the
readiest access; while others refer them, in part at least, to thermo-electricity
excited by the solar rays on the surface of the earth during
its rotation; successive parts of the atmosphere, land, and sea being
exposed to the influence of the sun, and then cooled again in the night.
That this idea is not a mere speculation, is proved by the correspondence
of the diurnal variations of the magnet with the apparent motion
of the sun; and by the greater amount of variation in summer than in
winter, and during the day than in the night. M. de la Rive, although
conceding that such minor variations of the needle may be due to
thermo-electricity, contends that the general phenomena of terrestrial
magnetism must be attributed to currents far more intense; which,
though liable to secular fluctuations, act with much greater constancy
and regularity than the causes which produce the diurnal variations.<a name="FNanchor_757" id="FNanchor_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_757" class="fnanchor">757</a>
The remark seems just; yet it is difficult to assign limits to the accumulated
influence even of a very feeble force constantly acting on the
whole surface of the earth. This subject, however, must evidently
remain obscure, until we become acquainted with the causes which give
a determinate direction to the supposed electric currents. Already the
experiments of Faraday on the rotation of magnets have led him to
speculate on the manner in which the earth, when once it had become
magnetic, might produce electric currents within itself, in consequence
of its diurnal rotation.<a name="FNanchor_758" id="FNanchor_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_758" class="fnanchor">758</a> We have seen also in a former chapter (p. 129)
that the recent observations of Schwabe, 1852, have led Col. Sabine to
the discovery of a connection between certain periodical changes, which
take place in the spots on the sun, and a certain cycle of variations in
terrestrial magnetism. These seem to point to the existence of a solar
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_544" id="Page_544">544</a></span>
magnetic period, and suggest the idea of the sun's magnetism exerting
an influence on the mass of our planet.</p>

<p>In regard to thermo-electricity, I may remark, that it may be generated
by great inequalities of temperature, arising from a partial distribution
of volcanic heat. Wherever, for example, masses of rock occur
of great horizontal extent, and of considerable depth, which are at one
point in a state of fusion (as beneath some active volcano); at another,
red-hot; and at a third, comparatively cold&mdash;strong thermo-electric
action may be excited.</p>

<p>Some, perhaps, may object, that this is reasoning in a circle; first to
introduce electricity as one of the primary causes of volcanic heat, and
then to derive the same heat from thermo-electric currents. But there
must, in truth, be much reciprocal action between the agents now under
consideration; and it is very difficult to decide which should be regarded
as the prime mover, or to see where the train of changes, once
begun, would terminate. Whether subterranean electric currents if
once excited might sometimes possess the decomposing power of the
voltaic pile, is a question not perhaps easily answered in the present
state of science; but such a power, if developed, would at once supply
us with a never-failing source of chemical action from which volcanic
heat might be derived.</p>

<p><i>Recapitulation.</i>&mdash;Before entering, in the next chapter, still farther
into the inquiry, how far the phenomena of volcanoes and earthquakes
accord with the hypothesis of a continued generation of heat by chemical
action, it may be desirable to recapitulate, in a few words, the conclusions
already obtained.</p>

<p>1st. The primary causes of the volcano and the earthquake are, to a
great extent, the same, and must be connected with the passage of heat
from the interior to the surface.</p>

<p>2dly. This heat has been referred, by many, to a supposed state of
igneous fusion of the central parts of the planet when it was first
created, of which a part still remains in the interior, but is always
diminishing in intensity.</p>

<p>3dly. The spheroidal figure of the earth, adduced in support of this
theory, does not of necessity imply a universal and simultaneous
fluidity, in the beginning; for supposing the original figure of our planet
had been strictly spherical&mdash;which, however, is a gratuitous assumption,
resting on no established analogy&mdash;still the statical figure must have
been assumed, if sufficient time be allowed, by the gradual operation of
the centrifugal force, acting on the materials brought successively within
its action by aqueous and igneous causes.</p>

<p>4thly. It appears, from experiment, that the heat in mines increases
progressively with their depth; and if the ratio of increase be continued
uniformly from the surface to the interior, the whole globe, with the
exception of a small external shell, must be fluid, and the central parts
must have a temperature many times higher than that of melted iron.</p>

<p>5thly. But the theory adopted by M. Cordier and others, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_545" id="Page_545">545</a></span>
maintains the actual existence of such a state of things, seems wholly
inconsistent with the laws which regulate the circulation of heat through
fluid bodies. For, if the central heat were as intense as is represented,
there must be a circulation of currents, tending to equalize the temperature
of the resulting fluids, and the solid crust itself would be melted.</p>

<p>6thly. Instead of an original central heat, we may, perhaps, refer the
heat of the interior to chemical changes constantly going on in the earth's
crust; for the general effect of chemical combination is the evolution of
heat and electricity, which in their turn become sources of new chemical
changes.</p>

<p>When we reflect that the largest mountains are but insignificant protuberances
upon the surface of the earth, and that these mountains are
nevertheless composed of different parts which have been formed in succession,
we may well feel surprise that the central fluidity of the planet
should have been called in to account for volcanic phenomena. To suppose
the entire globe to be in a state of igneous fusion, with the exception
of a solid shell, not more than from thirty to one hundred miles
thick, and to imagine that the central heat of this fluid spheroid exceeds
by more than two hundred times that of liquid lava, is to introduce a
force altogether disproportionate to the effects which it is required to
explain.</p>

<p>The ordinary repose of the surface implies, on the contrary, an inertness
in the internal mass which is truly wonderful. When we consider
the combustible nature of the elements of the earth, so far as they are
known to us,&mdash;the facility with which their compounds may be decomposed
and made to enter into new combinations,&mdash;the quantity of heat
which they evolve during these processes; when we recollect the expansive
power of steam, and that water itself is composed of two gases which,
by their union, produce intense heat; when we call to mind the number
of explosive and detonating compounds which have been already discovered,
we may be allowed to share the astonishment of Pliny, that a single

<p>The signs of internal heat observable on the surface of the earth do
not necessarily indicate the permanent existence of subterranean heated
masses, whether fluid or solid, by any means so vast as our continents
and seas; yet how insignificant would these appear if distributed through
an external shell of the globe one or two hundred miles in depth! The
principal facts in proof of the accumulation of heat below the surface
may be summed up in a few words. Several volcanoes are constantly
in eruption, as Stromboli and Nicaragua; others are known to have been
active for periods of 60, or even 150 years, as those of Sangay in Quito,
Popocatepetl in Mexico, and the volcano of the Isle of Bourbon. Many
craters emit hot vapors in the intervals between eruptions, and solfataras
evolve incessantly the same gases as volcanoes. Steam of high temperature
has continued for more than twenty centuries to issue from the
"stufas," as the Italians call them; thermal springs abound not only
in regions of earthquakes, but are found in almost all countries, however
distant from active vents; and, lastly, the temperature in the mines of
various parts of the world is found to increase in proportion as we descend.</p>

<p>The diagram (<a href="#f93">fig. 93</a>) in the next page, may convey some idea of the
proportion which our continents and the ocean bear to the radius of the
earth.<a name="FNanchor_760" id="FNanchor_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_760" class="fnanchor">760</a> If all the land were about as high as the Himalaya mountains,
and the ocean everywhere as deep as the Pacific, the whole of both
might be contained within a space expressed by the thickness of the line
<i>a b</i>; and masses of nearly equal volume might be placed in the space
marked by the line <i>c d</i>, in the interior. Seas of lava, therefore, of the
size of the Mediterranean, or even of the Atlantic, would be as nothing
if distributed through such an outer shell of the globe as is represented
by the shaded portion of the figure <i>a b c d</i>. If throughout that space
we imagine electro-chemical causes to be continually in operation, even
of very feeble power, they might give rise to heat which, if accumulated
at certain points, might melt or render red-hot entire mountains, or sustain
the temperature of stufas and hot springs for ages.</p>

<p><i>Theory of an unoxidated metallic nucleus.</i>&mdash;When Sir H. Davy first
discovered the metallic basis of the earths and alkalies, he threw out the
idea that those metals might abound in an unoxidized state in the subterranean
regions to which water must occasionally penetrate. Whenever
this happened, gaseous matter would be set free, the metals would
combine with the oxygen of the water, and sufficient heat might be
evolved to melt the surrounding rocks. This hypothesis, although afterwards
abandoned by its author, was at first very favorably received
both by the chemist and the geologist: for silica, alumina, lime, soda, and
oxide of iron,&mdash;substances of which lavas are principally composed,&mdash;would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_547" id="Page_547">547</a></span>
all result from the contact of the inflammable metals alluded to
with water. But whence this abundant store of unsaturated metals in
the interior? It was assumed that, in the beginning of things, the
nucleus of the earth was mainly composed of inflammable metals, and
that oxidation went on with intense energy at first; till at length, when
a superficial crust of oxides had been formed, the chemical action became
more and more languid.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 350px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 93.</span><a name="f93" id="f93"></a><img src="images/f93.png" width="350" height="815" alt=">Centre of the earth." title="" />
<p class="center2">Centre of the earth.</p></div>

<p>This speculation, like all others respecting the primitive state of the
earth's nucleus, rests unavoidably on arbitrary assumptions. But we
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_548" id="Page_548">548</a></span>
may fairly inquire whether any existing causes may have the power of
deoxidating the earthy and alkaline compounds formed from time to
time by the action of water upon the metallic bases. If so, and if the
original crust or nucleus of the planet contained distributed through it
here and there some partial stores of potassium, sodium, and other metallic
bases, these might be oxidated and again deoxidated, so as to sustain
for ages a permanent chemical action. Yet even then we should
be unable to explain why such a continuous circle of operations, after
having been kept up for thousands of years in one district, should entirely
cease, and why another region, which had enjoyed a respite from
volcanic action for one or many geological periods, should become a theatre
for the development of subterranean heat.</p>

<p>It is well known to chemists, that the metallization of oxides, the
most difficult to reduce, may be effected by hydrogen brought into contact
with them at a red heat; and it is more than probable that the
production of potassium itself, in the common gun-barrel process, is due
to the power of nascent hydrogen derived from the water which the
hydrated oxide contains. According to the recent experiments, also, of
Faraday, it would appear that every case of metallic reduction by voltaic
agency, from saline solutions, in which water is present, is due to
the secondary action of hydrogen upon the oxide; both of these being
determined to the negative pole and then reacting upon one another.</p>

<p>It is admitted that intense heat would be produced by the occasional
contact of water with the metallic bases; and it is certain that, during
the process of saturation, vast volumes of hydrogen must be evolved.
The hydrogen, thus generated, might permeate the crust of the earth
in different directions, and become stored up for ages in fissures and
caverns, sometimes in a liquid form, under the necessary pressure.
Whenever, at any subsequent period, in consequence of the changes
effected by earthquakes in the shell of the earth, this gas happened to
come in contact with metallic oxides at a high temperature, the reduction
of these oxides might be the result.</p>

<p>No theory seems at first more startling than that which represents
water as affording an inexhaustible supply of fuel to the volcanic fires;
yet is it by no means visionary. It is a fact that must not be overlooked,
that while a great number of volcanoes are entirely submarine, the remainder
occur for the most part in islands or maritime tracts. There
are a few exceptions; but some of these, observes Dr. Daubeny, are near
inland salt lakes, as in Central Tartary; while others form part of a
train of volcanoes, the extremities of which are near the sea.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy suggested that, when the sea is distant, as in the case of
some of the South American volcanoes, they may still be supplied with
water from subterranean lakes; since, according to Humboldt, large
quantities of fish are often thrown out during eruptions.<a name="FNanchor_761" id="FNanchor_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_761" class="fnanchor">761</a> Mr. Dana
also, in his valuable and original observations on the volcanoes of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_549" id="Page_549">549</a></span>
Sandwich Islands, reminds us of the prodigious volume of atmospheric
water which must be absorbed into the interior of such large and lofty
domes, composed as they are entirely of porous lava. To this source
alone he refers the production of the steam by which the melted matter
is propelled upwards, even to the summit of cones three miles in height.<a name="FNanchor_762" id="FNanchor_762"></a><a href="#Footnote_762" class="fnanchor">762</a></p>

<p>When treating of springs and overflowing wells, I have stated that
porous rocks are percolated by fresh water to great depths, and that
sea-water probably penetrates in the same manner through the rocks
which form the bed of the ocean. But, besides this universal circulation
in regions not far from the surface, it must be supposed that,
wherever earthquakes prevail, much larger bodies of water will be
forced by the pressure of the ocean into fissures at great depths, or
swallowed up in chasms; in the same manner as on the land, towns,
houses, cattle, and trees are sometimes engulfed. It will be remembered,
that these chasms often close again after houses have fallen into
them; and for the same reason, when water has penetrated to a mass
of melted lava, the steam into which it is converted may often rush out
at a different aperture from that by which the water entered.</p>

<p>The gases, it is said, exhaled from volcanoes, together with steam, are
such as would result from the decomposition of salt water, and the
fumes which escape from the Vesuvian lava have been observed to deposit
common salt.<a name="FNanchor_763" id="FNanchor_763"></a><a href="#Footnote_763" class="fnanchor">763</a> The emission of free muriatic acid gas in great
quantities is also thought by many to favor the theory of the decomposition
of the salt contained in sea-water. It has been objected, however,
that M. Boussingault did not meet with this gas in his examination of the
elastic fluids evolved from the volcanoes of equatorial America; which
only give out aqueous vapor (in very large quantity), carbonic acid gas,
sulphurous acid gas, and sometimes fumes of sulphur.<a name="FNanchor_764" id="FNanchor_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_764" class="fnanchor">764</a> In reply, Dr.
Daubeny has remarked, that muriatic acid may have ceased to be disengaged,
because the volcanic action has become languid in equatorial
America, and sea-water may no longer obtain admission.</p>

<p>M. Gay Lussac, while he avows his opinion that the decomposition
of water contributes largely to volcanic action, called attention, nevertheless,
to the supposed fact, that hydrogen had not been detected in
a separate form among the gaseous products of volcanoes; nor can it,
he says, be present; for, in that case, it would be inflamed in the air
by the red-hot stones thrown out during an eruption. Dr. Davy, in
his account of Graham Island, says, "I watched when the lightning was
most vivid, and the eruption of the greatest degree of violence, to see if
there was any inflammation occasioned by this natural electric spark&mdash;any
indication of the presence of inflammable gas; but in vain."<a name="FNanchor_765" id="FNanchor_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor">765</a></p>

<p>May not the hydrogen, Gay Lussac inquires, be combined with chlorine,
and produce muriatic acid? for this gas has been observed to be
evolved from Vesuvius&mdash;and the chlorine may have been derived from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_550" id="Page_550">550</a></span>
sea salt; which was, in fact, extracted by simple washing from the
Vesuvian lava of 1822, in the proportion of nine per cent.<a name="FNanchor_766" id="FNanchor_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor">766</a> But it
was answered, that Sir H. Davy's experiments had shown, that hydrogen
is not combustible when mixed with muriatic acid gas; so that if
muriatic gas was evolved in large quantities, the hydrogen might be
present without inflammation.<a name="FNanchor_767" id="FNanchor_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor">767</a> M. Abich, on the other hand, assures
us, "that although it be true that vapor illuminated by incandescent
lava has often been mistaken for flame," yet he clearly detected in the
eruption of Vesuvius in 1834 the flame of hydrogen.<a name="FNanchor_768" id="FNanchor_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor">768</a></p>

<p>M. Gay Lussac, in the memoir just alluded to, expressed doubt as to
the presence of sulphurous acid; but the abundant disengagement of
this gas during eruptions has been since ascertained: and thus all difficulty
in regard to the general absence of hydrogen in an inflammable
state is removed; for, as Dr. Daubeny suggests, the hydrogen of decomposed
water may unite with sulphur to form sulphuretted hydrogen
gas, and this gas will then be mingled with the sulphurous acid as it
rises to the crater. It is shown by experiment, that these gases mutually
decompose each other when mixed where steam is present; the
hydrogen of the one immediately uniting with the oxygen of the other
to form water, while the excess of sulphurous acid alone escapes into
the atmosphere. Sulphur is at the same time precipitated.</p>

<p>This explanation is sufficient; but it may also be observed that the
flame of hydrogen would rarely be visible during an eruption; as that
gas, when inflamed in a pure state, burns with a very faint blue flame,
which even in the night could hardly be perceptible by the side of redhot
and incandescent cinders. Its immediate, conversion into water
when inflamed in the atmosphere, might also account for its not appearing
in a separate form.</p>

<p>Dr. Daubeny is of opinion that water containing atmospheric air may
descend from the surface of the earth to the volcanic foci, and that the
same process of combustion by which water is decomposed may deprive
such subterranean air of its oxygen. In this manner he explains the
great quantities of nitrogen evolved from volcanic vents and thermal
waters, and the fact that air disengaged from the earth in volcanic regions
is either wholly or in part deprived of its oxygen.</p>

<p>Sir H. Davy, in his memoir on the "Phenomena of Volcanoes," remarks,
that there was every reason to suppose in Vesuvius the existence
of a descending current of air; and he imagined that subterranean
cavities which threw out large volumes of steam during the eruption,
might afterwards, in the quiet state of the volcano, become filled with
atmospheric air.<a name="FNanchor_769" id="FNanchor_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor">769</a> The presence of ammoniacal salts in volcanic emanations,
and of ammonia (which is in part composed of nitrogen) in lava,
favors greatly the notion of air as well as water being deoxidated in the
interior of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_770" id="FNanchor_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor">770</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_551" id="Page_551">551</a></span>
It has been alleged by Professor Bischoff that the slight specific gravity
of the metals of the alkalies is fatal to Davy's hypothesis, for if the
mean density of the earth, as determined by astronomers, surpass that
of all kinds of rocks, these metals cannot exist, at least not in great
quantities in the interior of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_771" id="FNanchor_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor">771</a> But Dr. Daubeny has shown,
that if we take the united specific gravity of potassium, sodium, silicon,
iron, and all the materials which, when united with oxygen, constitute
ordinary lava, and then compare their weight with lava of equal bulk,
the difference is not very material, the specific gravity of the lava only
exceeding by about one-fourth that of the unoxidized metals. Besides,
at great depths, the metallic bases of the earths and alkalies may very
probably be rendered heavier by pressure.<a name="FNanchor_772" id="FNanchor_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor">772</a> Nor is it fair to embarrass
the chemical theory of volcanoes with a doctrine so purely gratuitous,
as that which supposes the entire nucleus of the planet to have been at
first composed of unoxidated metals.</p>

<p>Professor Bunsen of Marburg, after analyzing the gases which escape
from the volcanic fumeroles and solfataras of Iceland, and after calculating
the quantity of hydrogen evolved between two eruptions, affirms,
in contradiction of opinions previously entertained, that the hydrogen
bears a perfect relation in quantity to the magnitude of the streams of
lava, assuming the fusion of these last to have been the result of the
heat evolved during the oxidation of alkaline and earthy metals, and this
to have been brought about by the decomposition of water. Yet after
having thus succeeded in removing the principal objection once so
triumphantly urged against Davy's hypothesis, Bunsen concludes by
declaring that the hydrogen evolved in volcanic regions cannot have
been generated by the decomposition of water coming in contact with
alkaline and earthy metallic bases. For, says the Professor, this process
presupposes the prevalence of a temperature in which carbonic acid cannot
exist in contact with hydrogen without suffering a partial reduction
to carbonic oxide; "and not a trace of carbonic oxide is ever found in
volcanic exhalations."<a name="FNanchor_773" id="FNanchor_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor">773</a> At the same time it will be seen, by consulting
the able memoirs of the Marburg chemist, that he supposes many energetic
kinds of chemical action to be continually going on in the interior
of the earth, capable of causing the disengagement of hydrogen; and
there can be no doubt that this gas may be a source of innumerable new
changes, capable of producing the local development of internal heat.</p>

<p><i>Cause of volcanic eruptions.</i>&mdash;The most probable causes of a volcanic
outburst at the surface have been in a great degree anticipated in the
preceding speculations on the liquefaction of rocks and the generation of
gases. When a minute hole is bored in a tube filled with gas condensed
into a liquid, the whole becomes instantly aeriform, or, as some writers
have expressed it, "flashes into vapor," and often bursts the tube. Such
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_552" id="Page_552">552</a></span>
an experiment may represent the mode in which gaseous matter may
rush through a rent in the rocks, and continue to escape for days or
weeks through a small orifice, with an explosive power sufficient to reduce
every substance which opposes its passage into small fragments or
even dust. Lava may be propelled upwards at the same time, and ejected
in the form of scori&aelig;. In some places, where the fluid lava lies at the
bottom of a deep fissure, communicating on the one hand with the surface,
and on the other with a cavern in which a considerable body of
vapor has been formed, there may be an efflux of lava, followed by the
escape of gas. Eruptions often commence and close with the discharge
of vapor; and, when this is the case, the next outburst may be expected
to take place by the same vent, for the concluding evolution of elastic
fluids will keep open the duct, and leave it unobstructed.</p>

<p>The breaking out of lava from the side or base of a lofty cone, rather
than from the summit, may be attributed to the hydrostatic pressure to
which the flanks of the mountain are exposed, when the column of lava
has risen to a great height. Or if, before it has reached the top, there
should happen to be any stoppage in the main duct, the upward pressure
of the ascending column of gas and lava may burst a lateral opening.</p>

<p>In the case however of Mount Loa, in the Sandwich Islands, there
appears to be a singular want of connection or sympathy between the
eruptions of the central and the great lateral vent. The great volcanic
cone alluded to rises to the height of 13,760 feet above the level of the
sea, having a crater at its summit, from which powerful streams of lava
have flowed in recent times, and having another still larger crater, called
Kilauea, on its southeastern slope, about 4000 feet above the sea. This
lateral cavity resembles a huge quarry cut in the mountain's side, being
about 1000 feet deep when in its ordinary state. It is seven miles and
a half in circuit, and scattered over its bottom, at different levels, are
lakes and pools of lava, always in a state of ebullition. The liquid in one
of these will sometimes sink 100 or 150 feet, while it is overflowing in
another at a higher elevation, there being, it should seem, no communication
between them. In like manner, lava overflows in the summit
crater of Mount Loa, nearly 14,000 feet high, while the great lateral
cauldron just alluded to (of Kilauea) continues as tranquil as usual, affording
no relief to any part of the gases or melted matter which are forcing
their way upwards in the centre of the mountain. "How," asks Mr.
Dana, "if there were any subterranean channel connecting the two great
vents, could this want of sympathy exist? How, according to the laws
of hydrostatic pressure, can a column of fluid stand 10,000 feet higher
in one leg of the siphon than in the other?" The eruptions, he observes,
are not paroxysmal; on the contrary, the lava rises slowly and gradually
to the summit of the lofty cone, and then escapes there without any
commotion manifesting itself in Kilauea, a gulf always open on the flanks
of the same mountain. One conclusion, he says, is certain, namely, <i>that
volcanoes are no safety valves</i> as they have been called; for here two
independent and apparently isolated centres of volcanic activity, only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_553" id="Page_553">553</a></span>
sixteen miles distant from each other, are sustained in one and the same
cone.<a name="FNanchor_774" id="FNanchor_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor">774</a></p>

<p>Without pretending to solve this enigma, I cannot refrain from remarking,
that the supposed independence of several orifices of eruption
in one crater like Kilauea, when adduced in confirmation of the doctrine
of two distinct sources of volcanic action underneath one mountain,
proves too much. No one can doubt, that the pools of lava in Kilauea
have been derived from some common reservoir, and have resulted from
a combination of causes commonly called volcanic, which are at work in
the interior at some unknown distance below. These causes have given
rise in Mount Loa to eruptions from many points, but principally from
one centre, so that a vast dome of ejected matter has been piled up.
The subsidiary crater has evidently never given much relief to the imprisoned,
heated, and liquefied matter, for Kilauea does not form a lateral
protuberance interfering with the general shape or uniform outline
of Mount Loa.</p>

<p><i>Geysers of Iceland.</i>&mdash;As aqueous vapor constitutes the most abundant
of the aeriform products of volcanoes in eruption, it may be well to consider
attentively a case in which steam is exclusively the moving power&mdash;that
of the Geysers of Iceland. These intermittent hot springs occur
in a district situated in the southwestern division of Iceland, where
nearly one hundred of them are said to break out within a circle of two
miles. That the water is of atmospheric origin, derived from rain and
melted snow, is proved, says Professor Bunsen, by the nitrogen which
rises from them either pure or mixed with other gases. The springs
rise through a thick current of lava, which may perhaps have flowed
from Mount Hecla, the summit of that volcano being seen from the spot
at the distance of more than thirty miles. In this district the rushing
of water is sometimes heard in chasms beneath the surface; for here,
as on Etna, rivers flow in subterranean channels through the porous and
cavernous lavas. It has more than once happened, after earthquakes,
that some of the boiling fountains have increased or diminished in violence
and volume, or entirely ceased, or that new ones have made their
appearance&mdash;changes which may be explained by the opening of new
rents and the closing of pre-existing fissures.</p>

<p>Few of the Geysers play longer than five or six minutes at a time,
although sometimes half an hour. The intervals between their eruptions
are for the most part very irregular. The Great Geyser rises out
of a spacious basin at the summit of a circular mound composed of siliceous
incrustations deposited from the spray of its waters. The diameter
of this basin, in one direction, is fifty-six feet, and forty-six in another.
(See <a href="#f94">fig. 94</a>.) In the centre is a pipe seventy-eight feet in perpendicular
depth, and from eight to ten feet in diameter, but gradually widening,
as it rises into the basin. The inside of the basin is whitish, consisting
of a siliceous crust, and perfectly smooth, as are likewise two small
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_554" id="Page_554">554</a></span>
channels on the sides of the mound, down which the water escapes
when the bowl is filled to the margin. The circular basin is sometimes
empty, as represented in the following sketch; but is usually filled with
beautifully transparent water in a state of ebullition. During the rise
of the boiling water in the pipe, especially when the ebullition is most
violent, and when the water is thrown up in jets, subterranean noises
are heard, like the distant firing of cannon, and the earth is slightly
shaken. The sound then increases and the motion becomes more violent,
till at length a column of water is thrown up, with loud explosions, to
the height of one or two hundred feet. After playing for a time like
an artificial fountain, and giving off great clouds of vapor, the pipe or
tube is emptied; and a column of steam, rushing up with amazing force
and a thundering noise, terminates the eruption.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 94.</span><a name="f94" id="f94"></a><img src="images/f94.png" width="550" height="393" alt="View of the Crater of the Great Geyser in Iceland." title="" />

<p class="center2">View of the Crater of the Great Geyser in Iceland.<a name="FNanchor_775" id="FNanchor_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor">775</a></p></div>

<p>If stones are thrown into the crater, they are instantly ejected; and
such is the explosive force, that very hard rocks are sometimes shivered
by it into small pieces. Henderson found that by throwing a great
quantity of large stones into the pipe of Strockr, one of the Geysers, he
could bring on an eruption in a few minutes.<a name="FNanchor_776" id="FNanchor_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor">776</a> The fragments of stone,
as well as the boiling water, were thrown in that case to a much greater
height than usual. After the water had been ejected, a column of steam
continued to rush up with a deafening roar for nearly an hour; but the
Geyser, as if exhausted by this effort, did not send out a fresh eruption
when its usual interval of rest had elapsed. The account given by Sir
George Mackenzie of a Geyser which he saw in eruption in 1810 (see
<a href="#f95">fig. 95</a>), agrees perfectly with the above description by Henderson. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_555" id="Page_555">555</a></span>
steam and water rose for half an hour to the height of 70 feet, and the
white column remained perpendicular notwithstanding a brisk gale of
wind which was blowing against it. Stones thrown into the pipe were
projected to a greater height than the water. To leeward of the vapor
a heavy shower of rain was seen to fall.<a name="FNanchor_777" id="FNanchor_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor">777</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 95.</span><a name="f95" id="f95"></a><img src="images/f95.png" width="500" height="627" alt="Eruption of the New Geyser in 1810. (Mackenzie.)" title="" />

<p class="center2">Eruption of the New Geyser in 1810. (Mackenzie.)</p></div>

<p>Among the different theories proposed to account for these phenomena,
I shall first mention one suggested by Sir. J. Herschel. An imitation
of these jets, he says, may be produced on a small scale, by heating
red hot the stem of a tobacco pipe, filling the bowl with water, and
so inclining the pipe as to let the water run through the stem. Its escape,
instead of taking place in a continued stream, is then performed by
a succession of violent explosions, at first of steam alone, then of water
mixed with steam; and, as the pipe cools, almost wholly of water. At
every such paroxysmal escape of the water, a portion is driven back, accompanied
with steam, into the bowl. The intervals between the explosions
depend on the heat, length, and inclination of the pipe; their continuance,
on its thickness and conducting power.<a name="FNanchor_778" id="FNanchor_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor">778</a>
The application of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_556" id="Page_556">556</a></span>
this experiment to the Geysers merely requires that a subterranean
stream, flowing through the pores and crevices of lava, should suddenly
reach a fissure in which the rock is red hot or nearly so. Steam would
immediately be formed, which, rushing up the fissure, might force up
water along with it to the surface, while, at the same time, part of the
steam might drive back the water of the supply for a certain distance
towards its source. And when, after the space of some minutes, the
steam was all condensed, the water would return, and a repetition of the
phenomena take place.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 96.</span><a name="f96" id="f96"></a><img src="images/f96.png" width="500" height="454" alt="Supposed reservoir and pipe of a Geyser in Iceland." title="" />

<p>There is, however, another mode of explaining the action of the Geyser,
perhaps more probable than that above described. Suppose water
percolating from the surface of the earth to penetrate into the subterranean
cavity A D (<a href="#f96">fig. 96</a>) by the fissures F F, while, at the same time,
steam at an extremely high temperature, such as is commonly given out
from the rents of lava currents during congelation, emanates from the
fissures C. A portion of the steam is at first condensed into water,
while the temperature of the water is raised by the latent heat thus
evolved, till, at last, the lower part of the cavity is filled with boiling
water and the upper with steam under high pressure. The expansive
force of the steam becomes, at length, so great, that the water is forced
up the fissure or pipe E B, and runs over the rim of the basin. When
the pressure is thus diminished, the steam in the upper part of the cavity
A expands, until all the water D is driven into the pipe; and when this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_557" id="Page_557">557</a></span>
happens, the steam, being the lighter of the two fluids, rushes up
through the water with great velocity. If the pipe be choked up artificially,
even for a few minutes, a great increase of heat must take place;
for it is prevented from escaping in a latent form in steam; so that the
water is made to boil more violently, and this brings on an eruption.</p>

<p>Professor Bunsen, before cited, adopts this theory to account for the
play of the "Little Geyser," but says it will not explain the phenomena
of the Great one. He considers this, like the others, to be a thermal
spring, having a narrow funnel-shaped tube in the upper part of its
course, where the walls of the channel have become coated over with
siliceous incrustations. At the mouth of this tube the water has a
temperature, corresponding to the pressure of the atmosphere, of about
212&deg; Fahr., but at a certain depth below it is much hotter. This the
professor succeeded in proving by experiment; a thermometer suspended
by a string in the pipe rising to 266&deg; Fahr., or no less than 48
degrees above the boiling point. After the column of water has been
expelled, what remains in the basin and pipe is found to be much cooled.</p>

<p>Previously to these experiments of Bunsen and Descloizeaux, made in
Iceland in 1846, it would scarcely have been supposed possible that the
lower part of a free and open column of water could be raised so much
in temperature without causing a circulation of ascending and descending
currents, followed by an almost immediate equalization of heat.
Such circulation is no doubt impeded greatly by the sides of the well
not being vertical, and by numerous contractions of its diameter, but
the phenomenon may be chiefly due to another cause. According to
recent experiments on the cohesion of liquids by Mr. Donny of Ghent,
it appears that when water is freed from all admixture of air, its temperature
can be raised, even under ordinary atmospheric pressure, to
275&deg; Fahr., so much does the cohesion of its molecules increase<a name="FNanchor_780" id="FNanchor_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor">780</a> when
they are not separated by particles of air. As water long boiled becomes
more and more deprived of air, it is probably very free from such
intermixture at the bottom of the Geysers.</p>

<p>Among other results of the experiments of Bunsen and his companion,
they convinced themselves that the column of fluid filling the
tube is constantly receiving accessions of hot water from below, while it
becomes cooler above by evaporation on the broad surface of the basin.
They also came to a conclusion of no small interest, as bearing on the
probable mechanism of ordinary volcanic eruptions, namely that the
tube itself is the main seat or focus of mechanical force. This was
proved by letting down stones suspended by strings to various depths.
Those which were sunk to considerable distances from the surface were
not cast up again, whereas those nearer the mouth of the tube were ejected
to great heights. Other experiments also were made tending to demonstrate
the singular fact, that there is often scarce any motion below,
when a violent rush of steam and water is taking place above. It seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_558" id="Page_558">558</a></span>
that when a lofty column of water possesses a temperature increasing
with the depth, any slight ebullition or disturbance of equilibrium in the
upper portion may first force up water into the basin, and then cause it
to flow over the edge. A lower portion, thus suddenly relieved of part
of its pressure, expands and is converted into vapor more rapidly than
the first, owing to its greater heat. This allows the next subjacent
stratum, which is much hotter, to rise and flash into a gaseous form;
and this process goes on till the ebullition has descended from the
middle to near the bottom of the funnel.<a name="FNanchor_781" id="FNanchor_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor">781</a></p>

<p>In speculating, therefore, on the mechanism of an ordinary volcanic
eruption, we may suppose that large subterranean cavities exist at the
depth of some miles below the surface of the earth, in which melted
lava accumulates; and when water containing the usual mixture of air
penetrates into these, the steam thus generated may press upon the
lava and force it up the duct of a volcano, in the same manner as a
column of water is driven up the pipe of a Geyser. In other cases we
may suppose a continuous column of liquid lava mixed with <i>red-hot
water</i> (for water may exist in that state, as Professor Bunsen reminds
us, under pressure), and this column may have a temperature regularly
increasing downwards. A disturbance of equilibrium may first bring on
an eruption near the surface, by the expansion and conversion into gas
of entangled water and other constituents of what we call lava, so as to
occasion a diminution of pressure. More steam would then be liberated,
carrying up with it jets of melted rock, which being hurled up into the
air may fall in showers of ashes on the surrounding country, and at
length, by the arrival of lava and water more and more heated at the
orifice of the duct or the crater of the volcano, expansive power may be
acquired sufficient to expel a massive current of lava. After the eruption
has ceased, a period of tranquillity succeeds, during which fresh
accessions of heat are communicated from below, and additional masses
of rock fused by degrees, while at the same time atmospheric or sea
water is descending from the surface. At length the conditions required
for a new outburst are obtained, and another cycle of similar
changes is renewed.</p>

<p><i>Causes of earthquakes&mdash;wave-like motion.</i>&mdash;I shall now proceed to
examine the manner in which the heat of the interior may give rise to
earthquakes. One of the most common phenomena attending subterranean
movements, is the undulatory motion of the ground. And this,
says Michell, will seem less extraordinary, if we call to mind the extreme
elasticity of the earth and the compressibility of even the most solid
materials. Large districts, he suggests, may rest on fluid lava; and,
when this is disturbed, its motions may be propagated through the incumbent
rocks. He also adds the following ingenious speculation:&mdash;"As
a small quantity of vapor almost instantly generated at some considerable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_559" id="Page_559">559</a></span>
depth below the surface of the earth will produce a vibratory
motion, so a very large quantity (whether it be generated almost instantly,
or in any small portion of time) will produce a wave-like motion.
The manner in which this wave-like motion will be propagated
may, in some measure, be represented by the following experiment:&mdash;Suppose
a large cloth, or carpet (spread upon a floor), to be raised at
one edge, and then suddenly brought down again to the floor; the air
under it, being by this means propelled, will pass along till it escapes
at the opposite side, raising the cloth in a wave all the way as it goes.
In like manner, a large quantity of vapor may be conceived to raise the
earth in a wave, as it passes along between the strata, which it may
easily separate in a horizontal direction, there being little or no cohesion
between one stratum and another. The part of the earth that is first
raised being bent from its natural form, will endeavor to restore itself
by its elasticity; and the parts next to it being to have their weight
supported by the vapor, which will insinuate itself under them, will be
raised in their turn, till it either finds some vent, or is again condensed
by the cold into water, and by that means prevented from proceeding
any farther."<a name="FNanchor_782" id="FNanchor_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor">782</a> In a memoir published in 1843, on the structure of the
Appalachian chain, by the Professors Rogers,<a name="FNanchor_783" id="FNanchor_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor">783</a> the following hypothesis
is proposed as "simpler and more in accordance with dynamical considerations,
and the recorded observations on earthquakes."&mdash;"In
place," say they, "of supposing it possible for a body of vapor or gaseous
matter to pass horizontally between the strata, or even between the
crust and the fluid lava upon which it floats, and with which it must
be closely entangled, we are inclined to attribute the movement to an
<i>actual pulsation</i>, engendered in the <i>molten matter itself</i>, by a linear disruption
under enormous tension, giving vent explosively to elastic vapors,
escaping either to the surface, or into cavernous spaces beneath. According
to this supposition, the movement of the subterranean vapors
would be <i>towards</i>, and not from, the disrupted belt, and the oscillation
of the crust would originate in the tremendous and sudden disturbance
of the previous pressure on the surface of the lava mass below, brought
about by the instantaneous and violent rending of the overlying strata."</p>

<p>This theory requires us to admit that the crust of the earth is so
flexible, that it can assume the form, and follow the motion of an undulation
in the fluid below. Even if we grant this, says Mr. Mallet, another
more serious objection presents itself, viz. the great velocity attributed
to the transit of the wave in the subterranean sea of lava. We are called
upon to admit that the speed of the wave below equals that of the true
earthquake shock at the surface, which is so immense, that it is not inferior
to the velocity of sound in the same solids. But the undulation
in the fluid below must follow the laws of a tidal wave, or of the great
sea-wave already spoken of. "Its velocity, like that of the tidal wave
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_560" id="Page_560">560</a></span>
of our seas, will be a function of its length and of the depth of the fluid,
diminished in this case by certain considerations as to the density and
degree of viscidity of the liquid; and although it would be at present
impossible, for want of data, to calculate the exact velocity with which
this subterraneous lava-wave could move, it may be certainly affirmed
that its velocity would be immeasurably short of the observed or theoretic
velocity of the great earth-wave, or true shock in earthquakes."<a name="FNanchor_784" id="FNanchor_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor">784</a></p>

<p><i>Liquid gases.</i>&mdash;The rending and upheaving of continental masses are
operations which are not difficult to explain, when we are once convinced
that heat, of sufficient power, not only to melt but to reduce to a gaseous
form a great variety of substances, is accumulated in certain parts
of the interior. We see that elastic fluids are capable of projecting solid
masses to immense heights in the air; and the volcano of Cotopaxi has
been known to throw out, to the distance of eight or nine miles, a mass
of rock about one hundred cubic yards in volume. When we observe
these aeriform fluids rushing out from particular vents for months, or
even years, continuously, what power may we not expect them to exert
in other places, where they happen to be confined under an enormous
weight of rock?</p>

<p>The experiments of Faraday and others have shown, within the last
twelve years, that many of the gases, including all those which are most
copiously disengaged from volcanic vents, as the carbonic, sulphurous,
and muriatic acids, may be condensed into liquids by pressure. At
temperatures of from 30&deg; to 50&deg; F., the pressure required for this purpose
varies from fifteen to fifty atmospheres; and this amount of pressure
we may regard as very insignificant in the operations of nature. A
column of Vesuvian lava that would reach from the lip of the crater to
the level of the sea, must be equal to about three hundred atmospheres;
so that, at depths which may be termed moderate in the interior of the
crust of the earth, the gases may be condensed into liquids, even at very
high temperatures. The method employed to reduce some of these
gases to a liquid state is, to confine the materials, from the mutual action
of which they are evolved, in tubes hermetically sealed, so that the accumulated
pressure of the vapor, as it rises and expands, may force
some part of it to assume the liquid state. A similar process may, and
indeed must, frequently take place in subterranean caverns and fissures,
or even in the pores and cells of many rocks; by which means, a much
greater store of expansive power may be <i>packed</i> into a small space than
could happen if these vapors had not the property of becoming liquid.
For, although the gas occupies much less room in a liquid state, yet it
exerts exactly the same pressure upon the sides of the containing cavity
as if it remained in the form of vapor.</p>

<p>If a tube, whether of glass or other materials, filled with condensed
gas, have its temperature slightly raised, it will often burst; for a slight
increment of heat causes the elasticity of the gas to increase in a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_561" id="Page_561">561</a></span>
high ratio. We have only to suppose certain rocks, permeated by these
liquid gases (as porous strata are sometimes filled with water), to have
their temperature raised some hundred degrees, and we obtain a power
capable of lifting superincumbent masses of almost any conceivable thickness;
while, if the depth at which the gas is confined be great, there is
no reason to suppose that any other appearances would be witnessed by
the inhabitants of the surface than vibratory movements and rents, from
which no vapor might escape. In making their way through fissures a
very few miles only in length, or in forcing a passage through soft yielding
strata, the vapors may be cooled and absorbed by water. For water
has a strong affinity to several of the gases, and will absorb large quantities,
with a very slight increase of volume. In this manner, the heat
or the volume of springs may be augmented, and their mineral properties
made to vary.</p>

<p><i>Connection between the state of the atmosphere and earthquakes.</i>&mdash;The
inhabitants of Stromboli, who are mostly fishermen, are said to make
use of that volcano as a weather-glass, the eruptions being comparatively
feeble when the sky is serene, but increasing in turbulence during
tempestuous weather, so that in winter the island often seems to shake
from its foundations. Mr. P. Scrope, after calling attention to these
and other analogous facts, first started the idea (as long ago as the year
1825) that the diminished pressure of the atmosphere, the concomitant
of stormy weather, may modify the intensity of the volcanic action. He
suggests that where liquid lava communicates with the surface, as in
the crater of Stromboli, it may rise or fall in the vent on the same principle
as mercury in a barometer; because the ebullition or expansive
power of the steam contained in the lava would be checked by every
increase, and augmented by every diminution of weight. In like manner,
if a bed of liquid lava be confined at an immense depth below the
surface, its expansive force may be counteracted partly by the weight
of the incumbent rocks, and also in part by atmospheric pressure acting
contemporaneously on a vast superficial area. In that case, if the upheaving
force increase gradually in energy, it will at length be restrained
by only the slightest degree of superiority in the antagonist or repressive
power, and then the equilibrium may be suddenly destroyed by
any cause, such as an ascending draught of air, which is capable of
depressing the barometer. In this manner we may account for the
remarkable coincidence so frequently observed between the state of the
weather and subterranean commotions, although it must be admitted
that earthquakes and volcanic eruptions react in their turn upon the
atmosphere, so that disturbances of the latter are generally the consequences
rather than the forerunners of volcanic disturbances.<a name="FNanchor_785" id="FNanchor_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor">785</a></p>

<p>From an elaborate catalogue of the earthquakes experienced in Europe
and Syria during the last fifteen centuries, M. Alexis Perrey has
deduced the conclusion that the number which happen in the winter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_562" id="Page_562">562</a></span>
season preponderates over those which occur in any one of the other
seasons of the year, there being, however, some exceptions to this rule,
as in the Pyrenees. Curious and valuable as are these data, M. d'Archiac
justly remarks, in commenting upon them, that they are not as
yet sufficiently extensive or accordant in different regions, to entitle us
to deduce any general conclusions from them respecting the laws of
subterranean movements throughout the globe.<a name="FNanchor_786" id="FNanchor_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor">786</a></p>

<p><i>Permanent elevation and subsidence.</i>&mdash;It is easy to conceive that the
shattered rocks may assume an arched form during a convulsion, so
that the country above may remain permanently upheaved. In other
cases gas may drive before it masses of liquid lava, which may thus be
injected into newly opened fissures. The gas having then obtained
more room, by the forcing up of the incumbent rocks, may remain at
rest; while the lava congealing in the rents may afford a solid foundation
for the newly raised district.</p>

<p>Experiments have recently been made in America, by Colonel Totten,
to ascertain the ratio according to which some of the stones commonly
used in architecture expand with given increments of heat.<a name="FNanchor_787" id="FNanchor_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor">787</a> It was
found impossible, in a country where the annual variation of temperature
was more than 90&deg; F., to make a coping of stones, five feet in
length, in which the joints should fit so tightly as not to admit water
between the stone and the cement; the annual contraction and expansion
of the stones causing, at the junctions, small crevices, the width of
which varied with the nature of the rock. It was ascertained that fine-grained
granite expanded with 1&deg; F. at the rate of &middot;000004825; while
crystalline marble &middot;000005668; and red sandstone &middot;000009532, or
about twice as much as granite.</p>

<p>Now, according to this law of expansion, a mass of sandstone a mile
in thickness, which should have its temperature raised 200&deg; F., would
lift a superimposed layer of rock to the height of ten feet above its
former level. But, suppose a part of the earth's crust, one hundred
miles in thickness and equally expansive, to have its temperature raised
600&deg; or 800&deg;, this might produce an elevation of between two and
three thousand feet. The cooling of the same mass might afterwards
cause the overlying rocks to sink down again and resume their original
position. By such agency we might explain the gradual rise of Scandinavia
or the subsidence of Greenland, if this last phenomenon should
also be established as a fact on farther inquiry.</p>

<p>It is also possible that as the clay in Wedgwood's pyrometer contracts,
by giving off its water, and then, by incipient vitrification; so,
large masses of argillaceous strata on the earth's interior may shrink,
when subjected to heat and chemical changes, and allow the incumbent
rocks to subside gradually.</p>

<p>Moreover, if we suppose that lava cooling slowly at great depths
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_563" id="Page_563">563</a></span>
may be converted into various granitic rocks, we obtain another source
of depression; for, according to the experiments of Deville and the
calculations of Bischoff, the contraction of granite when passing from a
melted or plastic to a solid and crystalline state must be more than ten
per cent.<a name="FNanchor_788" id="FNanchor_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor">788</a> The sudden subsidence of land may also be occasioned by
subterranean caverns giving way, when gases are condensed, or when
they escape through newly-formed crevices. The subtraction, moreover,
of matter from certain parts of the interior, by the flowing of lava
and of mineral springs, must, in the course of ages, cause vacuities
below, so that the undermined surface may at length fall in.</p>

<p><i>The balance of dry land, how preserved.</i>&mdash;In the present state of our
knowledge, we cannot pretend to estimate the average number of earthquakes
which may happen in the course of a single year. As the area of
the ocean is nearly three times that of the land, it is probable that about
three submarine earthquakes may occur for one exclusively continental;
and when we consider the great frequency of slight movements in certain
districts, we can hardly suppose that a day, if, indeed, an hour, ever
passes without one or more shocks being experienced in some part of
the globe. We have also seen that in Sweden, and other countries,
changes in the relative level of sea and land may take place without
commotion, and these perhaps produce the most important geographical
and geological changes; for the position of land may be altered to a
greater amount by an elevation or depression of one inch over a vast
area, than by the sinking of a more limited tract, such as the forest of
Aripao, to the depth of many fathoms at once.<a name="FNanchor_789" id="FNanchor_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor">789</a></p>

<p>It must be evident, from the historical details above given, that the
force of subterranean movement, whether intermittent or continuous,
whether with or without disturbance, does not operate at random, but is
developed in certain regions only; and although the alterations produced
during the time required for the occurrence of a few volcanic eruptions
may be inconsiderable, we can hardly doubt that, during the ages
necessary for the formation of large volcanic cones, composed of thousands
of lava currents, shoals might be converted into lofty mountains,
and low lands into deep seas.</p>

<p>In a former chapter (p. 198), I have stated that aqueous and igneous
agents may be regarded as antagonist forces; the aqueous laboring incessantly
to reduce the inequalities of the earth's surface to a level,
while the igneous are equally active in renewing the unevenness of the
surface. By some geologists it has been thought that the levelling power
of running water was opposed rather to the <i>elevating</i> force of earthquakes
than to their action generally. This opinion is, however, untenable;
for the sinking down of the bed of the ocean is one of the
means by which the gradual submersion of land is prevented. The depth
of the sea cannot be increased at any one point without a universal fall
of the waters, nor can any partial deposition of sediment occur without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_564" id="Page_564">564</a></span>
the displacement of a quantity of water of equal volume, which will
raise the sea, though in an imperceptible degree, even to the antipodes.
The preservation, therefore, of the dry land may sometimes be effected
by the subsidence of part of the earth's crust (that part, namely, which
is covered by the ocean), and in like manner an upheaving movement
must often tend to destroy land; for if it render the bed of the sea more
shallow, it will displace a certain quantity of water, and thus tend to
submerge low tracts.</p>

<p>Astronomers having proved (see above, p. <a href="#Page_129">129</a>) that there has been
no change in the diameter of the earth during the last two thousand
years, we may assume it as probable, that the dimensions of the planet
remain uniform. If, then, we inquire in what manner the force of earthquakes
must be regulated, in order to restore perpetually the inequalities
of the surface which the levelling power of water tends to efface, it will
be found, that the amount of depression must exceed that of elevation.
It would be otherwise if the action of volcanoes and mineral springs were
suspended; for then the forcing outwards of the earth's envelope ought
to be no more than equal to its sinking in.</p>

<p>To understand this proposition more clearly, it must be borne in mind,
that the deposits of rivers and currents probably add as much to the
height of lands which are rising, as they take from those which have
risen. Suppose a large river to bring down sediment to a part of the
ocean two thousand feet deep, and that the depth of this part is gradually
reduced by the accumulation of sediment till only a shoal remains,
covered by water at high tides; if now an upheaving force should uplift
this shoal to the height of 2000 feet, the result would be a mountain
2000 feet high. But had the movement raised the same part of the
bottom of the sea before the sediment of the river had filled it up; then,
instead of changing a shoal into a mountain 2000 feet high, it would
only have converted a deep sea into a shoal.</p>

<p>It appears, then, that the operations of the earthquake are often such
as to cause the levelling power of water to counteract itself; and,
although the idea may appear paradoxical, we may be sure, wherever
we find hills and mountains composed of stratified deposits, that such
inequalities of the surface would have had no existence if water, at some
former period, had not been laboring to reduce the earth's surface to
one level.</p>

<p>But, besides the transfer of matter by running water from the continents
to the ocean, there is a constant transportation from below upwards,
by mineral springs and volcanic vents. As mountain masses are,
in the course of ages, created by the pouring forth of successive streams
of lava, so stratified rocks, of great extent, originate from the deposition
of carbonate of lime, and other mineral ingredients, with which springs
are impregnated. The surface of the land, and portions of the bottom
of the sea, being thus raised, the external accessions due to these operations
would cause the dimensions of the planet to enlarge continually, if
the amount of depression of the earth's crust were no more than equal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_565" id="Page_565">565</a></span>
to the elevation. In order, therefore, that the mean diameter of the
earth should remain uniform, and the unevenness of the surface be preserved,
it is necessary that the amount of subsidence should be in excess.
And such a predominance of depression is far from improbable,
on mechanical principles, since every upheaving movement must be
expected either to produce caverns in the mass below, or to cause some
diminution of its density. Vacuities must, also, arise from the subtraction
of the matter poured out from volcanoes and mineral springs,
or from the contraction of argillaceous masses by subterranean heat;
and the foundations having been thus weakened, the earth's crust, shaken
and rent by reiterated convulsions, must, in the course of time, fall in.</p>

<p>If we embrace these views, important geological consequences will
follow; since, if there be, upon the whole, more subsidence than elevation,
the average depth to which former surfaces have sunk beneath
their original level must exceed the height which ancient marine strata
have attained above the sea. If, for example, marine strata, about the
age of our chalk and greensand, have been lifted up in Europe to an extreme
height of more than eleven thousand feet, and a mean elevation of
some hundreds, we may conclude that certain parts of the surface, which
existed when those strata were deposited, have sunk to an extreme depth
of <i>more than</i> eleven thousand feet below their original level, and to a
mean depth of <i>more than</i> a few hundreds.</p>

<p>In regard to faults, also, we must infer, according to the hypothesis
now proposed, that a greater number have arisen from the sinking down
than from the elevation of rocks.</p>

<p>To conclude: it seems to be rendered probable, by the views above
explained, that the constant repair of the land, and the subserviency of
our planet to the support of terrestrial as well as aquatic species, are secured
by the elevating and depressing power of causes acting in the
interior of the earth; which, although so often the source of death and
terror to the inhabitants of the globe&mdash;visiting in succession every zone,
and filling the earth with monuments of ruin and disorder&mdash;are nevertheless
the agents of a conservative principle above all others essential to
the stability of the system.</p>

<h2>BOOK III.</h2>

<h4>CHAPTER XXXIII.</h4>

<h6>CHANGES OF THE ORGANIC WORLD NOW IN PROGRESS.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Division of the subject&mdash;Examination of the question, Whether species have a
real existence in nature?&mdash;Importance of this question in geology&mdash;Sketch of
Lamarck's arguments in favor of the transmutation of species, and his conjectures
respecting the origin of existing animals and plants&mdash;His theory of the transformation
of the orang-outang into the human species.</p></div>

<p>The last book, from chapters fourteen to thirty-three inclusive, was occupied
with the consideration of the changes brought about on the
earth's surface, within the period of human observation, by inorganic
agents; such, for example, as rivers, marine currents, volcanoes, and
earthquakes. But there is another class of phenomena relating to the
organic world, which have an equal claim on our attention, if we desire
to obtain possession of all the preparatory knowledge respecting the existing
course of nature, which may be available in the interpretation of
geological monuments. It appeared from our preliminary sketch of the
progress of the science, that the most lively interest was excited among
its earlier cultivators, by the discovery of the remains of animals and
plants in the interior of mountains frequently remote from the sea.
Much controversy arose respecting the nature of these remains, the
causes which may have brought them into so singular a position, and the
want of a specific agreement between them and known animals and
plants. To qualify ourselves to form just views on these curious questions,
we must first study the present condition of the animate creation
on the globe.</p>

<p>This branch of our inquiry naturally divides itself into two parts: first,
we may examine the vicissitudes to which species are subject; secondly,
the processes by which certain individuals of these species occasionally
become fossil. The first of these divisions will lead us, among other
topics, to inquire, first, whether species have a real and permanent existence
in nature? or whether they are capable, as some naturalists pretend,
of being indefinitely modified in the course of a long series of
generations? Secondly, whether, if species have a real existence, the
individuals composing them have been derived originally from many
similar stocks, or each from one only, the descendants of which have
spread themselves gradually from a particular point over the habitable
lands and waters? Thirdly, how far the duration of each species of
animal and plant is limited by its dependence on certain fluctuating and
temporary conditions in the state of the animate and inanimate world?
Fourthly, whether there be proofs of the successive extermination of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_567" id="Page_567">567</a></span>
species in the ordinary course of nature, and whether there be any reason
for conjecturing that new animals and plants are created from time
to time, to supply their place?</p>

<p><i>Whether species have a real existence in nature.</i>&mdash;Before we can advance
a step in our proposed inquiry, we must be able to define precisely
the meaning which we attach to the term species. This is even
more necessary in geology than in the ordinary studies of the naturalist;
for they who deny that such a thing as a species exists, concede nevertheless
that a botanist or zoologist may reason as if the specific character
were constant, because they confine their observations to a brief period
of time. Just as the geographer, in constructing his maps from century
to century, may proceed as if the apparent places of the fixed stars remained
absolutely the same, and as if no alteration were brought about
by the precession of the equinoxes; so, it is said, in the organic world,
the stability of a species may be taken as absolute, if we do not extend
our views beyond the narrow period of human history; but let a sufficient
number of centuries elapse, to allow of important revolutions in
climate, physical geography, and other circumstances, and the characters,
say they, of the descendants of common parents may deviate indefinitely
from their original type.</p>

<p>Now, if these doctrines be tenable, we are at once presented with a
principle of incessant change in the organic world; and no degree of
dissimilarity in the plants and animals which may formerly have existed,
and are found fossil, would entitle us to conclude that they may not have
been the prototypes and progenitors of the species now living. Accordingly
M. Geoffroy St. Hilaire has declared his opinion, that there has
been an uninterrupted succession in the animal kingdom, effected by
means of generation, from the earliest ages of the world up to the
present day, and that the ancient animals whose remains have been
preserved in the strata, however different, may nevertheless have been
the ancestors of those now in being. This notion is not very generally
received, but we are not warranted in assuming the contrary,
without fully explaining the data and reasoning by which it may be
refuted.</p>

<p>I shall begin by stating as concisely as possible all the facts and ingenious
arguments by which the theory has been supported; and for
this purpose I cannot do better than offer the reader a rapid sketch of
Lamarck's statement of the proofs which he regards as confirmatory of
the doctrine, and which he has derived partly from the works of his
predecessors and in part from original investigations.</p>

<p>His proofs and inferences will be best considered in the order in which
they appear to have influenced his mind, and I shall then point out some
of the results to which he was led while boldly following out his principles
to their legitimate consequences.</p>

<p><i>Lamarck's arguments in favor of the transmutation of species.</i>&mdash;The
name of species, observes Lamarck, has been usually applied to "every
collection of similar individuals produced by other individuals like themselves."<a name="FNanchor_790" id="FNanchor_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor">790</a>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_568" id="Page_568">568</a></span>
This definition, he admits, is correct; because every living
individual bears a very close resemblance to those from which it springs.
But this is not all which is usually implied by the term species; for the
majority of naturalists agree with Linn&aelig;us in supposing that all the individuals
propagated from one stock have certain distinguishing characters
in common, which will never vary, and which have remained the
same since the creation of each species.</p>

<p>In order to shake this opinion, Lamarck enters upon the following line
of argument:&mdash;The more we advance in the knowledge of the different
organized bodies which cover the surface of the globe, the more our embarrassment
increases, to determine what ought to be regarded as a
species, and still more how to limit and distinguish genera. In proportion
as our collections are enriched, we see almost every void filled up,
and all our lines of separation effaced! We are reduced to arbitrary determinations,
and are sometimes fain to seize upon the slight differences
of mere varieties, in order to form characters for what we choose to call
a species; and sometimes we are induced to pronounce individuals but
slightly differing, and which others regard as true species, to be varieties.</p>

<p>The greater the abundance of natural objects assembled together, the
more do we discover proofs that every thing passes by insensible shades
into something else; that even the more remarkable differences are
evanescent, and that nature has, for the most part, left us nothing at our
disposal for establishing distinctions, save trifling, and, in some respects,
puerile particularities.</p>

<p>We find that many genera amongst animals and plants are of such an
extent, in consequence of the number of species referred to them, that
the study and determination of these last has become almost impracticable.
When the species are arranged in a series, and placed near to
each other, with due regard to their natural affinities, they each differ
in so minute a degree from those next adjoining, that they almost melt
into each other, and are in a manner confounded together. If we see
isolated species, we may presume the absence of some more closely connected,
and which have not yet been discovered. Already are there
genera, and even entire orders&mdash;nay, whole classes, which present an
approximation to the state of things here indicated.</p>

<p>If, when species have been thus placed in a regular series, we select
one, and then, making a leap over several intermediate ones, we take a
second, at some distance from the first, these two will, on comparison,
be seen to be very dissimilar; and it is in this manner that every naturalist
begins to study the objects which are at his own door. He then
finds it an easy task to establish generic and specific distinctions; and it
is only when his experience is enlarged, and when he has made himself
master of the intermediate links, that his difficulties and ambiguities begin.
But while we are thus compelled to resort to trifling and minute
characters in our attempt to separate the species, we find a striking disparity
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_569" id="Page_569">569</a></span>
between individuals which we know to have descended from a
common stock; and these newly acquired peculiarities are regularly
transmitted from one generation to another, constituting what are called
<i>races</i>.</p>

<p>From a great number of facts, continues the author, we learn that
in proportion as the individuals of one of our species change their situation,
climate, and manner of living, they change also, by little and little,
the consistence and proportions of their parts, their form, their faculties,
and even their organization, in such a manner that every thing in them
comes at last to participate in the mutations to which they have been
exposed. Even in the same climate, a great difference of situation and
exposure causes individuals to vary; but if these individuals continue
to live and to be reproduced under the same difference of circumstances,
distinctions are brought about in them which become in some degree
essential to their existence. In a word, at the end of many successive
generations, these individuals, which originally belonged to another
species, are transformed into a new and distinct species.<a name="FNanchor_791" id="FNanchor_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor">791</a></p>

<p>Thus, for example, if the seeds of a grass, or any other plant which
grows naturally in a moist meadow, be accidentally transported, first to
the slope of some neighboring hill, where the soil, although at a greater
elevation, is damp enough to allow the plant to live; and if, after having
lived there, and having been several times regenerated, it reaches by
degrees the drier and almost arid soil of a mountain declivity, it will
then, if it succeeds in growing, and perpetuates itself for a series of generations,
be so changed that botanists who meet with it will regard it as
a particular species.<a name="FNanchor_792" id="FNanchor_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor">792</a> The unfavorable climate in this case, deficiency
of nourishment, exposure to the winds, and other causes, give rise to a
stunted and dwarfish race, with some organ more developed than others,
and having proportions often quite peculiar.</p>

<p>What nature brings about in a great lapse of time, we occasion suddenly
by changing the circumstances in which a species has been accustomed
to live. All are aware that vegetables taken from their birthplace,
and cultivated in gardens, undergo changes which render them
no longer recognizable as the same plants. Many which were naturally
hairy become smooth, or nearly so; a great number of such as were
creepers and trailed along the ground, rear their stalks and grow erect.
Others lose their thorns or asperities; others, again, from the ligneous
state which their stem possessed in hot climates, where they were indigenous,
pass to the herbaceous; and, among them, some which were
perennials become mere annuals. So well do botanists know the effects
of such changes of circumstances, that they are averse to describe species
from garden specimens, unless they are sure that they have been cultivated
for a very short period.</p>

<p>"Is not the cultivated wheat" (<i>Triticum sativum</i>), asks Lamarck, "a
vegetable brought by man into the state in which we now see it? Let
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_570" id="Page_570">570</a></span>
any one tell me in what country a similar plant grows wild, unless where
it has escaped from cultivated fields? Where do we find in nature our
cabbages, lettuces, and other culinary vegetables, in the state in which
they appear in our gardens? Is it not the same in regard to a great
quantity of animals which domesticity has changed or considerably modified?"<a name="FNanchor_793" id="FNanchor_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor">793</a>
Our domestic fowls and pigeons are unlike any wild birds.
Our domestic ducks and geese have lost the faculty of raising themselves
into the higher regions of the air, and crossing extensive countries
in their flight, like the wild ducks and wild geese from which they were
originally derived. A bird which we breed in a cage cannot, when restored
to liberty, fly like others of the same species which have been
always free. This small alteration of circumstances, however, has only
diminished the power of flight, without modifying the form of any part
of the wings. But when individuals of the same race are retained in
captivity during a considerable length of time, the form even of their
parts is gradually made to differ, especially if climate, nourishment, and
other circumstances be also altered.</p>

<p>The numerous races of dogs which we have produced by domesticity
are nowhere to be found in a wild state. In nature we should seek in
vain for mastiffs, harriers, spaniels, greyhounds, and other races, between
which the differences are sometimes so great that they would be readily
admitted as specific between wild animals; "yet all these have sprung
originally from a single race, at first approaching very near to a wolf,
if, indeed, the wolf be not the true type which at some period or other
was domesticated by man."</p>

<p>Although important changes in the nature of the places which they
inhabit modify the organization of animals as well as vegetables; yet the
former, says Lamarck, require more time to complete a considerable
degree of transmutation; and, consequently, we are less sensible of such
occurrences. Next to a diversity of the medium in which animals or
plants may live, the circumstances which have most influence in modifying
their organs are differences in exposure, climate, the nature of the
soil, and other local particulars. These circumstances are as varied as
are the characters of the species, and, like them, pass by insensible shades
into each other, there being every intermediate gradation between the
opposite extremes. But each locality remains for a very long time the
same, and is altered so slowly that we can only become conscious of the
reality of the change by consulting geological monuments, by which we
learn that the order of things which how reigns in each place has not
always prevailed, and by inference anticipate that it will not always continue
the same.<a name="FNanchor_794" id="FNanchor_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor">794</a></p>

<p>Every considerable alteration in the local circumstances in which each
race of animals exists causes a change in their wants, and these new
wants excite them to new actions and habits. These actions require the
more frequent employment of some parts before but slightly exercised,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_571" id="Page_571">571</a></span>
and then greater development follows as a consequence of their more
frequent use. Other organs no longer in use are impoverished and
diminished in size, nay, are sometimes entirely annihilated, while in their
place new parts are insensibly produced for the discharge of new functions.<a name="FNanchor_795" id="FNanchor_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor">795</a></p>

<p>I must here interrupt the author's argument, by observing, that no
positive fact is cited to exemplify the substitution of some <i>entirely new</i>
sense, faculty, or organ, in the room of some other suppressed as
useless. All the instances adduced go only to prove that the dimensions
and strength of members and the perfection of certain attributes
may, in a long succession of generations, be lessened and enfeebled by
disuse; or, on the contrary, be matured and augmented by active exertion;
just as we know that the power of scent is feeble in the greyhound,
while its swiftness of pace and its acuteness of sight are remarkable&mdash;that
the harrier and stag-hound, on the contrary, are comparatively
slow in their movements, but excel in the sense of smelling.</p>

<p>It was necessary to point out to the reader this important chasm in
the chain of evidence, because he might otherwise imagine that I had
merely omitted the illustrations for the sake of brevity; but the plain
truth is, that there were no examples to be found; and when Lamarck
talks "of the efforts of internal sentiment," "the influence of subtle
fluids," and "acts of organization," as causes whereby animals and plants
may acquire <i>new organs</i>, he substitutes names for things; and, with a
disregard to the strict rules of induction, resorts to fictions, as ideal as
the "plastic virtue," and other phantoms of the geologists of the middle
ages.</p>

<p>It is evident that, if some well-authenticated facts could have been
adduced to establish one complete step in the process of transformation,
such as the appearance, in individuals descending from a common stock,
of a sense or organ entirely new, and a complete disappearance of some
other enjoyed by their progenitors, time alone might then be supposed
sufficient to bring about any amount of metamorphosis. The gratuitous
assumption, therefore, of a point so vital to the theory of transmutation,
was unpardonable on the part of its advocate.</p>

<p>But to proceed with the system: it being assumed as an undoubted
fact, that a change of external circumstances may cause one organ to
become entirely obsolete, and a new one to be developed, such as never
before belonged to the species, the following proposition is announced,
which, however staggering and absurd it may seem, is logically deduced
from the assumed premises. It is not the organs, or, in other words,
the nature and form of the parts of the body of an animal, which have
given rise to its habits, and its particular faculties; but, on the contrary,
its habits, its manner of living, and those of its progenitors, have in the
course of time determined the form of its body, the number and condition
of its organs&mdash;in short, the faculties which it enjoys. Thus otters,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_572" id="Page_572">572</a></span>
beavers, waterfowl, turtles, and frogs, were not made web-footed in
order that they might swim; but their wants having attracted them to
the water in search of prey, they stretched out the toes of their feet to
strike the water and move rapidly along its surface. By the repeated
stretching of their toes, the skin which united them at the base acquired
a habit of extension, until, in the course of time, the broad membranes
which now connect their extremities were formed.</p>

<p>In like manner, the antelope and the gazelle were not endowed with
light agile forms, in order that they might escape by flight from carnivorous
animals; but, having been exposed to the danger of being
devoured by lions, tigers, and other beasts of prey, they were compelled
to exert themselves in running with great celerity; a habit which, in the
course of many generations, gave rise to the peculiar slenderness of their
legs, and the agility and elegance of their forms.</p>

<p>The camelopard was not gifted with a long flexible neck because it
was destined to live in the interior of Africa, where the soil was arid
and devoid of herbage; but, being reduced by the nature of that
country to support itself on the foliage of lofty trees, it contracted a
habit of stretching itself up to reach the high boughs, until its neck
became so elongated that it could raise its head to the height of twenty
feet above the ground.</p>

<p>Another line of argument is then entered upon, in farther corroboration
of the instability of species. In order, it is said, that individuals
should perpetuate themselves unaltered by generation, those belonging
to one species ought never to ally themselves to those of
another; but such sexual unions do take place, both among plants and
animals; and although the offspring of such irregular connections are
usually sterile, yet such is not always the case. Hybrids have sometimes
proved prolific, where the disparity between the species was not
too great; and by this means alone, says Lamarck, varieties may gradually
be created by near alliances, which would become races, and in the
course of time would constitute what we term species.<a name="FNanchor_796" id="FNanchor_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor">796</a></p>

<p>But if the soundness of all these arguments and inferences be admitted,
we are next to inquire, what were the original types of form,
organization, and instinct, from which the diversities of character, as
now exhibited by animals and plants, have been derived? We know
that individuals which are mere varieties of the same species would, if
their pedigree could be traced back far enough, terminate in a single
stock; so, according to the train of reasoning before described, the
species of a genus, and even the genera of a great family, must have
had a common point of departure. What, then, was the single stem
from which so many varieties of form have ramified? Were there
many of these, or are we to refer the origin of the whole animate
creation, as the Egyptian priests did that of the universe, to a single
egg?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_573" id="Page_573">573</a></span>
In the absence of any positive data for framing a theory on so obscure
a subject, the following considerations were deemed of importance to
guide conjecture.</p>

<p>In the first place, if we examine the whole series of known animals,
from one extremity to the other, when they are arranged in the order
of their natural relations, we find that we may pass progressively, or, at
least, with very few interruptions, from beings of more simple to those
of a more compound structure; and, in proportion as the complexity of
their organization increases, the number and dignity of their faculties
increase also. Among plants, a similar approximation to a graduated
scale of being is apparent, Secondly, it appears, from geological observations,
that plants and animals of more simple organization existed on
the globe before the appearance of those of more compound structure,
and the latter were successively formed at more modern periods; each
new race being more fully developed than the most perfect of the preceding
era.</p>

<p>Of the truth of the last-mentioned geological theory, Lamarck seems
to have been fully persuaded; and he also shows that he was deeply
impressed with a belief prevalent amongst the older naturalists, that the
primeval ocean invested the whole planet long after it became the habitation
of living beings; and thus he was inclined to assert the priority of
the types of marine animals to those of the terrestrial, so as to fancy, for
example, that the testacea of the ocean existed first, until some of them,
by gradual evolution, were <i>improved</i> into those inhabiting the land.</p>

<p>These speculative views had already been, in a great degree, anticipated
by Demaillet in his Telliamed, and by several modern writers; so that
the tables were completely turned on the philosophers of antiquity, with
whom it was a received maxim, that created things were always most
perfect when they came first from the hands of their Maker; and that
there was a tendency to progressive deterioration in sublunary things
when left to themselves&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;omnia fatis</span>
<span class="i0">In pejus ruere, ac retr&ograve; sublapsa referri.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>So deeply was the faith of the ancient schools of philosophy imbued
with this d&oacute;ctrine, that, to check this universal proneness to degeneracy,
nothing less than the reintervention of the Deity was thought adequate;
and it was held, that thereby the order, excellence, and pristine energy
of the moral and physical world had been repeatedly restored.</p>

<p>But when the possibility of the indefinite modification of individuals
descending from common parents was once assumed, as also the geological
inference respecting the progressive development of organic life,
it was natural that the ancient dogma should be rejected, or rather reversed,
and that the most simple and imperfect forms and faculties should
be conceived to have been the originals whence all others were developed.
Accordingly, in conformity to these views, inert matter was supposed to
have been first endowed with life; until, in the course of ages, sensation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_574" id="Page_574">574</a></span>
was superadded to mere vitality: sight, hearing, and the other senses
were afterwards acquired; then instinct and the mental faculties; until,
finally, by virtue of the tendency of things to <i>progressive improvement</i>,
the irrational was developed in the rational.</p>

<p>The reader, however, will immediately perceive that when all the
higher orders of plants and animals were thus supposed to be comparatively
modern, and to have been derived in a long series of generations
from those of more simple conformation, some farther hypothesis became
indispensable, in order to explain why, after an indefinite lapse of ages,
there were still so many beings of the simplest structure. Why have
the majority of existing creatures remained stationary throughout this
long succession of epochs, while others have made such prodigious
advances? Why are there such multitudes of infusoria and polyps, or
of conferv&aelig; and other cryptogamic plants? Why, moreover, has the
process of development acted with such unequal and irregular force on
those classes of beings which have been greatly perfected, so that there
are wide chasms in the series; gaps so enormous, that Lamarck fairly
admits we can never expect to fill them up by future discoveries?</p>

<p>The following hypothesis was provided to meet these objections.
Nature, we are told, is not an intelligence, nor the Deity; but a delegated
power&mdash;a mere instrument&mdash;a piece of mechanism acting by
necessity&mdash;an order of things constituted by the Supreme Being, and
subject to laws which are the expressions of his will. This Nature is
<i>obliged</i> to proceed gradually in all her operations; she cannot produce
animals and plants of all classes at once, but must always begin by the
formation of the most simple kinds, and out of them elaborate the more
compound, adding to them, successively, different systems of organs, and
multiplying more and more their number and energy.</p>

<p>This nature is daily engaged in the formation of the elementary rudiments
of animal and vegetable existence, which correspond to what the
ancients termed <i>spontaneous generation</i>. She is always beginning anew,
day by day, the work of creation, by forming monads, or "rough
draughts" (&eacute;bauches), which are the only living things she gives birth
to <i>directly</i>.</p>

<p>There are distinct primary rudiments of plants and animals, and
<i>probably</i> of each of the great divisions of the animal and vegetable
kingdoms.<a name="FNanchor_797" id="FNanchor_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor">797</a> These are gradually developed into the higher and more
perfect classes by the slow but unceasing agency of two influential
principles: first, <i>the tendency to progressive advancement</i> in organization,
accompanied by greater dignity in instinct, intelligence, &amp;c.; secondly,
<i>the force of external circumstances</i>, or of variations in the physical condition
of the earth, or the mutual relations of plants and animals. For,
as species spread themselves gradually over the globe, they are exposed
from time to time to variations in climate, and to changes in the quantity
and quality of their food; they meet with new plants and animals which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_575" id="Page_575">575</a></span>
assist or retard their development, by supplying them with nutriment,
or destroying their foes. The nature, also, of each locality, is in itself
fluctuating; so that, even if the relation of other animals and plants were
invariable, the habits and organization of species would be modified by
the influence of local revolutions.</p>

<p>Now, if the first of these principles, <i>the tendency to progressive development</i>,
were left to exert itself with perfect freedom, it would give rise,
says Lamarck, in the course of ages, to a graduated scale of being,
where the most insensible transition might be traced from the simplest
to the most compound structure, from the humblest to the most exalted
degree of intelligence. But, in consequence of the perpetual interference
of the <i>external causes</i> before mentioned, this regular order is greatly
interfered with, and an approximation only to such a state of things is
exhibited by the animate creation, the progress of some races being
retarded by unfavorable, and that of others accelerated by favorable,
combinations of circumstances. Hence, all kinds of anomalies interrupt
the continuity of the plan; and chasms, into which whole genera or
families might be inserted, are seen to separate the nearest existing portions
of the series.</p>

<p><i>Lamarck's theory of the transformation of the orang-outang into the
human species.</i>&mdash;Such is the machinery of the Lamarckian system; but
the reader will hardly, perhaps, be able to form a perfect conception of
so complicated a piece of mechanism, unless it is exhibited in motion,
so that we may see in what manner it can work out, under the author's
guidance, all the extraordinary effects which we behold in the present
state of the animate creation. I have only space for exhibiting a small
part of the entire process by which a complete metamorphosis is
achieved, and shall therefore omit the mode by which, after a countless
succession of generations, a small gelatinous body is transformed into
an oak or an ape; passing on at once to the last grand step in the
progressive scheme, by which the orang-outang, having been already
evolved out of a monad, is made slowly to attain the attributes and
dignity of man.</p>

<p>One of the races of quadrumanous animals which had reached the
highest state of perfection, lost, by constraint of circumstances (concerning
the exact nature of which tradition is unfortunately silent), the
habit of climbing trees, and of hanging on by grasping the boughs with
their feet as with hands. The individuals of this race being obliged,
for a long series of generations, to use their feet exclusively for walking,
and ceasing to employ their hands as feet, were transformed into
bimanous animals, and what before were thumbs became mere toes, no
separation being required when their feet were used solely for walking.
Having acquired a habit of holding themselves upright, their legs and
feet assumed, insensibly, a conformation fitted to support them in an
erect attitude, till at last these animals could no longer go on all-fours
without much inconvenience.</p>

<p>The Angola orang (<i>Simia troglodytes</i>, Linn.) is the most perfect of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_576" id="Page_576">576</a></span>
animals; much more so than the Indian orang (<i>Simia Satyrus</i>), which
has been called the orang-outang, although <i>both</i> are <i>very inferior</i> to
man in corporeal powers and intelligence. These animals frequently
hold themselves upright; but their organization has <i>not yet</i> been sufficiently
modified to sustain them habitually in this attitude, so that the
standing posture is very uneasy to them. When the Indian orang is
compelled to take flight from pressing danger, he immediately falls
down upon all-fours, showing clearly that this was the original position
of the animal. Even in man, whose organization, in the course of a
long series of generations, has advanced so much farther, the upright
posture is fatiguing, and can be supported only for a limited time, and
by aid of the contraction of many muscles. If the vertebral column
formed the axis of the human body, and supported the head and all
the other parts in equilibrium, then might the upright position be a
state of repose: but, as the human head does not articulate in the centre
of gravity, as the chest, belly, and other parts press almost entirely
forward with their whole weight, and as the vertebral column reposes
upon an oblique base, a watchful activity is required to prevent the
body from falling. Children who have large heads and prominent bellies
can hardly walk at the end even of two years; and their frequent
tumbles indicate the natural tendency in man to resume the quadrupedal
state.</p>

<p>Now, when so much progress had been made by the quadrumanous
animals before mentioned, that they could hold themselves habitually
in an erect attitude, and were accustomed to a wide range of vision, and
ceased to use their jaws for fighting and tearing, or for clipping herbs
for food, their snout became gradually shorter, their incisor teeth became
vertical, and the facial angle grew more open.</p>

<p>Among other ideas which the natural <i>tendency to perfection</i> engendered,
the desire of ruling suggested itself, and this race succeeded at
length in getting the better of the other animals, and made themselves
masters of all those spots on the surface of the globe which best suited
them. They drove out the animals which approached nearest them in
organization and intelligence, and which were in a condition to dispute
with them the good things of this world, forcing them to take refuge in
deserts, woods, and wildernesses, where their multiplication was checked,
and the progressive development of their faculties retarded; while, in
the mean time, the dominant race spread itself in every direction, and
lived in large companies, where new wants were successively created,
exciting them to industry, and gradually perfecting their means and
faculties.</p>

<p>In the supremacy and increased intelligence acquired by the ruling
race, we see an illustration of the natural tendency of the organic world
to grow more perfect; and, in their influence in repressing the advance
of others, an example of one of those disturbing causes before enumerated,
that <i>force of external circumstances</i> which causes such wide chasms
in the regular series of animated being.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_577" id="Page_577">577</a></span>
When the individuals of the dominant race became very numerous,
their ideas greatly increased in number, and they felt the necessity of
communicating them to each other, and of augmenting and varying the
signs proper for the communication of ideas. Meanwhile the inferior
quadrumanous animals, although most of them were gregarious, acquired
no new ideas, being persecuted and restless in the deserts, and obliged
to fly and conceal themselves, so that they conceived no new wants.
Such ideas as they already had remained unaltered, and they could dispense
with the communication of the greater part of these. To make
themselves, therefore, understood by their fellows, required merely a
few movements of the body or limbs&mdash;whistling, and the uttering of
certain cries varied by the inflexions of the voice.</p>

<p>On the contrary, the individuals of the ascendant race, animated with
a desire of interchanging their ideas, which became more and more
numerous, were prompted to multiply the means of communication, and
were no longer satisfied with mere pantomimic signs, nor even with all
the possible inflexions of the voice, but made continual efforts to acquire
the power of uttering articulate sounds, employing a few at first, but
afterwards varying and perfecting them according to the increase of their
wants. The habitual exercise of their throat, tongue, and lips, insensibly
modified the conformation of these organs, until they became fitted for
the faculty of speech.<a name="FNanchor_798" id="FNanchor_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a></p>

<p>In effecting this mighty change, "the exigencies of the individuals
were the sole agents; they gave rise to efforts, and the organs proper
for articulating sounds were developed by their habitual employment."
Hence, in this peculiar race, the origin of the admirable faculty of speech;
hence also the diversity of languages, since the distance of places where
the individuals composing the race established themselves soon favored
the corruption of conventional signs.<a name="FNanchor_799" id="FNanchor_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a></p>

<p>In conclusion, it may be proper to observe that the above sketch of
the Lamarckian theory is no exaggerated picture, and those passages
which have probably excited the greatest surprise in the mind of the
reader are literal translations from the original.</p>

<p>The theory of the transmutation of species, considered in the last
chapter, has met with some degree of favor from many naturalists,
from their desire to dispense, as far as possible, with the repeated intervention
of a First Cause, as often as geological monuments attest the
successive appearance of new races of animals and plants, and the extinction
of those pre-existing. But, independently of a predisposition
to account, if possible, for a series of changes in the organic world by
the regular action of secondary causes, we have seen that in truth
many perplexing difficulties present themselves to one who attempts to
establish the nature and reality of the specific character. And if once
there appears ground of reasonable doubt, in regard to the constancy of
species, the amount of transformation which they are capable of undergoing
may seem to resolve itself into a mere question of the quantity
of time assigned to the past duration of animate existence.</p>

<p>Before entering upon the reasons which may be adduced for rejecting
Lamarck's hypothesis, I shall recapitulate, in a few words, the phenomena,
and the whole train of thought, by which I conceive it to have
been suggested, and which have gained for this and analogous theories,
both in ancient and modern times, a considerable number of votaries.</p>

<p>In the first place, the various groups into which plants and animals
may be thrown seem almost invariably, to a beginner, to be so natural,
that he is usually convinced at first, as was Linn&aelig;us to the last, "that
genera are as much founded in nature as the species which compose
them."<a name="FNanchor_800" id="FNanchor_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> When by examining the numerous intermediate gradations
the student finds all lines of demarcation to be in most instances obliterated,
even where they at first appeared most distinct, he grows
more and more sceptical as to the real existence of genera, and finally
regards them as mere arbitrary and artificial signs, invented, like those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_579" id="Page_579">579</a></span>
which serve to distinguish the heavenly constellations, for the convenience
of classification, and having as little pretensions to reality.</p>

<p>Doubts are then engendered in his mind as to whether species may
not also be equally unreal. The student is probably first struck with
the phenomenon, that some individuals are made to deviate widely
from the ordinary type by the force of peculiar circumstances, and
with the still more extraordinary fact, that the newly acquired peculiarities
are faithfully transmitted to the offspring. How far, he asks,
may such variations extend in the course of indefinite periods of
time, and during great vicissitudes in the physical condition of the
globe? His growing incertitude is at first checked by the reflection
that nature has forbidden the intermixture of the descendants of
distinct original stocks, or has, at least, entailed sterility on their
offspring, thereby preventing their being confounded together, and
pointing out that a multitude of distinct types must have been created
in the beginning, and must have remained pure and uncorrupted to
this day.</p>

<p>Relying on this general law, he endeavors to solve each difficult problem
by direct experiment, until he is again astounded by the phenomenon
of a prolific hybrid, and still more by an example of a
hybrid perpetuating itself throughout several generations in the vegetable
world. He then feels himself reduced to the dilemma of choosing
between two alternatives; either to reject the test, or to declare that
the two species, from the union of which the fruitful progeny has
sprung, were mere varieties. If he prefer the latter, he is compelled
to question the reality of the distinctness of all other supposed species
which differ no more than the parents of such prolific hybrids; for
although he may not be enabled immediately to procure, in all such
instances, a fruitful offspring; yet experiments show, that after repeated
failures, the union of two recognized species may at last, under very
favorable circumstances, give birth to a fertile progeny. Such circumstances,
therefore, the naturalist may conceive to have occurred again
and again, in the course of a great lapse of ages.</p>

<p>His first opinions are now fairly unsettled, and every stay at which he
has caught has given way one after another; he is in danger of
falling into any new and visionary doctrine which may be presented to
him; for he now regards every part of the animate creation as void of
stability, and in a state of continual flux. In this mood he encounters
the Geologist, who relates to him how there have been endless vicissitudes
in the shape and structure of organic beings in former ages&mdash;how
the approach to the present system of things has been gradual&mdash;that
there has been a progressive development of organization subservient
to the purposes of life, from the most simple to the most
complex state&mdash;that the appearance of man is the last phenomenon in
a long succession of events&mdash;and, finally, that a series of physical revolutions
can be traced in the inorganic world, coeval and co-extensive
with those of organic nature.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_580" id="Page_580">580</a></span>
These views seem immediately to confirm all his preconceived doubts
as to the stability of the specific character, and he begins to think there
may exist an inseparable connection between a series of changes in
the inanimate world, and the capability of the species to be indefinitely
modified by the influence of external circumstances. Henceforth his
speculations know no definite bounds; he gives the rein to conjecture,
and fancies that the outward form, internal structure, instinctive faculties,
nay, that reason itself may have been gradually developed from
some of the simplest states of existence&mdash;that all animals, that man
himself, and the irrational beings, may have had one common origin;
that all may be parts of one continuous and progressive scheme of
development, from the most imperfect to the more complex; in fine, he
renounces his belief in the high genealogy of his species, and looks forward,
as if in compensation, to the future perfectibility of man in his
physical, intellectual, and moral attributes.</p>

<p>Let us now proceed to consider what is defective in evidence, and
what fallacious in reasoning, in the grounds of these strange conclusions.
Blumenbach judiciously observes, that "no general rule can be
laid down for determining the distinctness of species, as there is no particular
class of characters which can serve as a criterion. In each
case we must be guided by <i>analogy</i> and <i>probability</i>." The multitude,
in fact, and complexity of the proofs to be weighed is so great, that we
can only hope to obtain presumptive evidence, and we must, therefore,
be the more careful to derive our general views as much as possible
from those observations where the chances of deception are least.
We must be on our guard not to tread in the footsteps of the naturalists
of the middle ages, who believed the doctrine of spontaneous
generation to be applicable to all those parts of the animal and vegetable
kingdoms which they least understood, in direct contradiction to the
analogy of all the parts best known to them; and who, when at length
they found that insects and cryptogamous plants were also propagated
from eggs or seeds, still persisted in retaining their old prejudices
respecting the infusory animalcules and other minute beings, the generation
of which had not then been demonstrated by the microscope to
be governed by the same laws.</p>

<p>Lamarck has, indeed, attempted to raise an argument in favor of his
system, out of the very confusion which has arisen in the study of some
orders of animals and plants, in consequence of the slight shades of
difference which separate the new species discovered within the last
half century. That the embarrassment of those who attempt to classify
and distinguish the new acquisitions, poured in such multitudes into
our museums, should increase with the augmentation of their number,
is quite natural; since to obviate this, it is not enough that our powers
of discrimination should keep pace with the increase of the objects, but
we ought to possess greater opportunities of studying each animal and
plant in all stages of its growth, and to know profoundly their history,
their habits, and physiological characters, throughout several generations;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_581" id="Page_581">581</a></span>
for, in proportion as the series of known animals grows more complete
none can doubt there is a nearer approximation to a graduated scale
of being; and thus the most closely allied species will be found to
possess a greater number of characters in common.</p>

<p><i>Causes of the difficulty of discriminating species.</i>&mdash;But, in point of
fact, our new acquisitions consist, more and more as we advance, of
specimens brought from foreign and often very distant and barbarous
countries. A large proportion have never even been seen alive by
scientific inquirers. Instead of having specimens of the young, the
adult, and the aged individuals of each sex, and possessing means of
investigating the anatomical structure, the peculiar habits, and instincts
of each, what is usually the state of our information? A single specimen,
perhaps, of a dried plant, or a stuffed bird or quadruped; a shell,
without the soft parts of the animal; an insect in one stage of its numerous
transformations;&mdash;these are the scanty and imperfect data which
the naturalist possesses. Such information may enable us to separate
species which stand at a considerable distance from each other; but we
have no right to expect any thing but difficulty and ambiguity, if we
attempt, from such imperfect opportunities, to obtain distinctive marks
for defining the characters of species which are closely related.</p>

<p>If Lamarck could introduce so much certainty and precision into the
classification of several thousand species of recent and fossil shells, notwithstanding
the extreme remoteness of the organization of these animals
from the type of those vertebrated species which are best known,
and in the absence of so many of the living inhabitants of shells, we are
led to form an exalted conception of the degree of exactness to which
specific distinctions are capable of being carried, rather than to call in
question their reality.</p>

<p>When our data are so defective, the most acute naturalist must expect
to be sometimes at fault, and, like the novice, to overlook essential
points of difference, passing unconsciously from one species to another,
until, like one who is borne along in a current, he is astonished on
looking back, at observing that he has reached a point so remote from
that whence he set out.</p>

<p>It is by no means improbable, that, when the series of species of
certain genera is very full, they may be found to differ less widely from
each other than do the mere varieties or races of certain species. If
such a fact could be established, it would, undoubtedly, diminish the
chance of our obtaining certainty in our results; but it would by no
means overthrow our confidence in the reality of species.</p>

<p><i>Some mere varieties possibly more distinct than certain individuals
of distinct species.</i>&mdash;It is almost necessary, indeed, to suppose that varieties
will differ in some cases more decidedly than some species, if we
admit that there is a graduated scale of being, and assume that the following
laws prevail in the economy of the animate creation:&mdash;first,
that the organization of individuals is capable of being modified to a
limited extent, by the force of external causes; secondly, that these
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_582" id="Page_582">582</a></span>
modifications are, to a certain extent, transmissible to their offspring;
thirdly, that there are fixed limits, beyond which the descendants from
common parents can never deviate from a certain type; fourthly, that
each species springs from one original stock, and can never be permanently
confounded by intermixing with the progeny of any other stock;
fifthly, that each species shall endure for a considerable period of time.
Now, let us assume, for the present, these rules hypothetically, and see
what consequences may naturally be expected to result from them.</p>

<p>We must suppose that when the Author of Nature creates an animal
or plant, all the possible circumstances in which its descendants are
destined to live are foreseen, and that an organization is conferred upon
it which will enable the species to perpetuate itself and survive under all
the varying circumstances to which it must be inevitably exposed.
Now, the range of variation of circumstances will differ essentially in
almost every case. Let us take, for example, any one of the most influential
conditions of existence, such as temperature. In some extensive
districts near the equator, the thermometer might never vary, throughout
several thousand centuries, for more than 20&deg; Fahrenheit; so that
if a plant or animal be provided with an organization fitting it to endure
such a range, it may continue on the globe for that immense period,
although every individual might be liable at once to be cut off by the
least possible excess of heat or cold beyond the determinate degree. But
if a species be placed in one of the temperate zones, and have a constitution
conferred on it capable of supporting a similar range of temperature
only, it will inevitably perish before a single year has passed away.</p>

<p>Humboldt has shown that, at Cumana, within the tropics, there is a
difference of only 4&deg; Fahr. between the temperature of the warmest and
coldest months; whereas, in the temperate zones, the annual variation
amounts to about 60&deg;, and the extreme range of the thermometer in
Canada is not less than 90&deg;.</p>

<p>The same remark might be applied to any other condition, as food,
for example; it may be foreseen that the supply will be regular throughout
indefinite periods in one part of the world, and in another very precarious
and fluctuating both in kind and quantity. Different qualifications
may be required for enabling species to live for a considerable time
under circumstances so changeable. If, then, temperature and food be
among those external causes which, according to certain laws of animal
and vegetable physiology, modify the organization, form, or faculties, of
individuals, we instantly perceive that the degrees of variability from a
common standard must differ widely in the two cases above supposed;
since there is a necessity of accommodating a species in one case to a
much greater latitude of circumstances than in the other.</p>

<p>If it be a law, for instance, that scanty sustenance should check those
individuals in their growth which are enabled to accommodate themselves
to privations of this kind, and that a parent, prevented in this
manner from attaining the size proper to its species, should produce a
dwarfish offspring, a stunted race will arise, as is remarkably exemplified
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_583" id="Page_583">583</a></span>
in some varieties of the horse and dog. The difference of stature in
some races of dogs, when compared to others, is as one to five in linear
dimensions, making a difference of a hundred-fold in volume.<a name="FNanchor_801" id="FNanchor_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> Now,
there is a good reason to believe that species in general are by no means
susceptible of existing under a diversity of circumstances, which may
give rise to such a disparity in size, and, consequently, there will be a
multitude of distinct species, of which no two adult individuals can ever
depart so widely from a certain standard of dimensions as the mere varieties
of certain other species&mdash;the dog, for instance. Now, we have
only to suppose that what is true of size, may also hold in regard to
color and many other attributes; and it will at once follow, that the
degree of possible discordance between varieties of the same species
may, in certain cases, exceed the utmost disparity which can arise between
two individuals of many distinct species.</p>

<p>The same remarks may hold true in regard to instincts; for, if it
be foreseen that one species will have to encounter a great variety
of foes, it may be necessary to arm it with great cunning and
circumspection, or with courage or other qualities capable of developing
themselves on certain occasions; such, for example, as those migratory
instincts which are so remarkably exhibited at particular periods, after
they have remained dormant for many generations. The history and
habits of one variety of such a species may often differ more considerably
from some other than those of many distinct species which have no
such latitude of accommodation to circumstances.</p>

<p><i>Extent of known variability in species.</i>&mdash;Lamarck has somewhat
mis-stated the idea commonly entertained of a species; for it is not
true that naturalists in general assume that the organisation of an
animal or plant remains absolutely constant, and that it can never
vary in any of its parts.<a name="FNanchor_802" id="FNanchor_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> All must be aware that circumstances
influence the habits, and that the habits may alter the state of the
parts and organs; but the difference of opinion relates to the extent
to which these modifications of the habits and organs of a particular
species may be carried.</p>

<p>Now, let us first inquire what positive facts can be adduced in the
history of known species, to establish a great and permanent amount
of change in the form, structure, or instinct of individuals descending
from some common stock. The best authenticated examples of the
extent to which species can be made to vary may be looked for in
the history of domesticated animals and cultivated plants. It usually
happens, that those species, both of the animal and vegetable kingdom,
which have the greatest pliability of organisation, those which
are most capable of accommodating themselves to a great variety of
new circumstances, are most serviceable to man. These only can
be carried by him into different climates, and can have their properties
or instincts variously diversified by differences of nourishment
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_584" id="Page_584">584</a></span>
and habits. If the resources of a species be so limited, and its habits
and faculties be of such a confined and local character, that it can
only flourish in a few particular spots, it can rarely be of great
utility.</p>

<p>We may consider, therefore, that in the domestication of animals
and the cultivation of plants, mankind have first selected those species
which have the most flexible frames and constitutions, and have then
been engaged for ages in conducting a series of experiments, with
much patience and at great cost, to ascertain what may be the greatest
possible deviation from a common type which can be elicited in these
extreme cases.</p>

<p><i>Varieties of the dog&mdash;no transmutation.</i>&mdash;The modifications produced
in the different races of dogs exhibit the influence of man
in the most striking point of view. These animals have been
transported into every climate and placed in every variety of circumstances;
they have been made, as a modern naturalist observes, the
servant, the companion, the guardian, and the intimate friend of
man, and the power of a superior genius has had a wonderful influence
not only on their forms, but on their manners and intelligence.<a name="FNanchor_803" id="FNanchor_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a>
Different races have undergone remarkable changes in the quantity
and color of their clothing; the dogs of Guinea are almost naked, while
those of the arctic circle are covered with a warm coat both of hair and
wool, which enables them to bear the most intense cold without
inconvenience. There are differences also of another kind no less
remarkable, as in size, the length of their muzzles, and the convexity of
their foreheads.</p>

<p>But, if we look for some of those essential changes which would
be required to lend even the semblance of a foundation for the theory
of Lamarck, respecting the growth of new organs and the gradual
obliteration of others, we find nothing of the kind. For, in all these
varieties of the dog, says Cuvier, the relation of the bones with each
other remains essentially the same; the form of the teeth never
changes in any perceptible degree, except that, in some individuals,
one additional false grinder occasionally appears, sometimes on the one
side, and sometimes on the other.<a name="FNanchor_804" id="FNanchor_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> The greatest departure from a
common type&mdash;and it constitutes the maximum of variation as yet
known in the animal kingdom&mdash;is exemplified in those races of
dogs which have a supernumerary toe on the hind foot with the corresponding
tarsal bones; a variety analogous to one presented by six-fingered
families of the human race.<a name="FNanchor_805" id="FNanchor_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a></p>

<p>Lamarck has thrown out as a conjecture, that the wolf may
have been the original of the dog; and eminent naturalists are still
divided in opinion on this subject. It seems now admitted that both
species agree in the period of gestation, and Mr. Owen has been unable
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_585" id="Page_585">585</a></span>
to confirm the alleged difference in the structure of a part of the intestinal
canal.<a name="FNanchor_806" id="FNanchor_806"></a><a href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a> Mr. Bell inclines to the opinion that all the various races
of dogs have descended from one common stock, of which the wolf is
the original source.</p>

<p>It is well known that the horse, the ox, the boar, and other domestic
animals which have been introduced into South America, and have run
wild in many parts, have entirely lost all marks of domesticity, and have
reverted to the original characters of their species. But dogs have also
become wild in Cuba, Hayti, and in all the Caribbean islands. In the
course of the seventeenth century, they hunted in packs from twelve to
fifty, or more, in number, and fearlessly attacked herds of wild boars
and other animals. It is natural, therefore, to inquire to what form
they reverted? Now, they are said by many travellers to have resembled
very nearly the shepherd's dog; but it is certain that they were
never turned into wolves. They were extremely savage, and their
ravages appear to have been as much dreaded as those of wolves; but
when any of their whelps were caught, and brought from the woods to
the towns, they grew up in the most perfect submission to man.<a name="FNanchor_807" id="FNanchor_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a></p>

<p>Many examples might be adduced to prove that the extent to which
the alteration of species can be pushed in the domestic state depends
on the original capacity of the species to admit of variation. The horse
has been as long domesticated as the dog, yet its different races depart
much less widely from a common type; the ass has been still less
changed, the camel scarcely at all; yet these species have probably
been subjected to the influence of domestication as long as the horse.</p>

<p><i>Mummies of animals in Egyptian tombs identical with species still
living.</i>&mdash;As the advocates of the theory of transmutation trust much to
the slow and insensible changes which time may work, they are accustomed
to lament the absence of accurate descriptions, and figures of
particular animals and plants, handed down from the earliest periods of
history, such as might have afforded data for comparing the condition
of species, at two periods considerably remote. But, fortunately, we
are in some measure independent of such evidence: for, by a singular
accident, the priests of Egypt have bequeathed to us, in their cemeteries,
that information which the museums and works of the Greek philosophers
have failed to transmit.</p>

<p>For the careful investigation of these documents, we are greatly
indebted to the skill and diligence of those naturalists who accompanied
the French armies during their brief occupation of Egypt: that
conquest of four years, from which we may date the improvement of the
modern Egyptians in the arts and sciences, and the rapid progress which
has been made of late in our knowledge of the arts and sciences of their
remote predecessors. Instead of wasting their whole time, as so many
preceding travellers had done, in exclusively collecting human mummies,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_586" id="Page_586">586</a></span>
M. Geoffrey and his associates examined diligently, and sent home
great numbers of embalmed bodies of consecrated animals, such as the
bull, the dog, the cat, the ape, the ichneumon, the crocodile, and
the ibis.</p>

<p>To those who have never been accustomed to connect the facts of
Natural History with philosophical speculations, who have never raised
their conceptions of the end and import of such studies beyond the mere
admiration of isolated and beautiful objects, or the exertion of skill in
detecting specific differences, it will seem incredible that amidst the din
of arms, and the stirring excitement of political movements, so much
enthusiasm could have been felt in regard to these precious remains.</p>

<p>In the official report drawn up by the Professors of the Museum at
Paris, on the value of these objects, there are some eloquent passages,
which may appear extravagant, unless we reflect how fully these naturalists
could appreciate the bearing of the facts thus brought to light on
the past history of the globe.</p>

<p>"It seems," say they, "as if the superstition of the ancient Egyptians
had been inspired by Nature, with a view of transmitting to after ages
a monument of her history. That extraordinary and eccentric people,
by embalming with so much care the brutes which were the objects of
their stupid adoration, have left us in their secret grottoes, cabinets of
zoology almost complete. The climate has conspired with the art of
embalming to preserve the bodies from corruption, and we can now assure
ourselves by our own eyes what was the state of a great number of
species three thousand years ago. We can scarcely restrain the transports
of our imagination, on beholding thus preserved, with their
minutest bones, with the smallest portions of their skin, and in every
particular most perfectly recognizable, many an animal, which at Thebes
or Memphis, two or three thousand years ago, had its own priests
and altars."<a name="FNanchor_808" id="FNanchor_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a></p>

<p>Among the Egyptian mummies thus procured were not only those of
numerous wild quadrupeds, birds, and reptiles; but what was perhaps
of still higher importance in deciding the great question under discussion,
there were the mummies of domestic animals, among which those
above mentioned, the bull, the dog, and the cat, were frequent. Now,
such was the conformity of the whole of these species to those now
living, that there was no more difference, says Cuvier, between them
than between the human mummies and the embalmed bodies of
men of the present day. Yet some of these animals have since that
period been transported by man to almost every climate, and forced to
accommodate their habits to the greatest variety of circumstances. The
cat, for example, has been carried over the whole earth, and within the
last three centuries, has been naturalized in every part of the new world,&mdash;from
the cold regions of Canada to the tropical plains of Guiana;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_587" id="Page_587">587</a></span>
yet it has scarcely undergone any perceptible mutation, and is still the
same animal which was held sacred by the Egyptians.</p>

<p>Of the ox, undoubtedly, there are many very distinct races; but the
bull Apis, which was led in solemn processions by the Egyptian priests,
did not differ from some of those now living. The black cattle that
have run wild in America, where there were many peculiarities in the climate
not to be found, perhaps, in any part of the old world, and where
scarcely a single plant on which they fed was of precisely the same
species, instead of altering their form and habits, have actually reverted
to the exact likeness of the aboriginal wild cattle of Europe.</p>

<p>In answer to the arguments drawn from the Egyptian mummies,
Lamarck said they were identical with their living descendants in the
same country, because the climate and physical geography of the banks
of the Nile have remained unaltered for the last thirty centuries. But
why, it may be asked, have other individuals of these species retained
the same characters in many different quarters of the globe, where the
climate and many other conditions are so varied?</p>

<p><i>Seeds and plants from the Egyptian tombs.</i>&mdash;The evidence derived
from the Egyptian monuments was not confined to the animal kingdom;
the fruits, seeds, and other portions of twenty different plants, were
faithfully preserved in the same manner; and among these the common
wheat was procured by Delille, from closed vessels in the sepulchres
of the kings, the grain of which retained not only their form
but even their color; so effectual has proved the process of embalming
with bitumen in a dry and equable climate. No difference could be
detected between this wheat and that which now grows in the East
and elsewhere; and in regard to the barley, I am informed by Mr.
Brown, the celebrated botanist, that its identity with the grain of our
own times can be tested by the closest comparison. On examining, for
example, one of the seeds from Mr. Sam's Egyptian collection in the
British Museum, it is found that "the structure of the husks or that
part of the flower which is persistent, agrees precisely with the barley of
the present day, in having one perfect flower and the filiform rudiments
of a second." Some naturalists believe that the perfect identification
of the ancient Egyptian cerealia with the varieties now cultivated has
been carried still further, by sowing the seeds taken out of the catacombs,
and raising plants from them; but we want more evidence of
this fact. Certain it is, that when the experiment was recently made
in the botanic garden at Kew, with 100 seeds of wheat, barley, and
lentils, from the Egyptian collection before mentioned of the British
Museum, not one of them would germinate.<a name="FNanchor_809" id="FNanchor_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_588" id="Page_588">588</a></span>
<i>Native country of the common wheat.</i>&mdash;And here I may observe that
there is an obvious answer to Lamarck's objection, that the botanist cannot
point out a country where the common wheat grows wild, unless in
places where it may have been derived from neighboring
cultivation.<a name="FNanchor_810" id="FNanchor_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a>
All naturalists are well aware that the geographical distribution of a
great number of species is extremely limited; that it was to be expected
that every useful plant should first be cultivated successfully in
the country where it was indigenous; and that, probably, every station
which it partially occupied, when growing wild, would be selected by
the agriculturist as best suited to it when artificially increased. Palestine
has been conjectured, by a late writer on the cerealia, to have been
the original habitation of wheat and barley; a supposition which is
rendered the more plausible by Hebrew and Egyptian traditions, and
by tracing the migrations of the worship of Ceres, as indicative of the
migrations of the plant.<a name="FNanchor_811" id="FNanchor_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a></p>

<p>If we are to infer that some one of the wild grasses has been transformed
into the common wheat, and that some animal of the genus
<i>Canis</i>, still unreclaimed, has been metamorphosed into the dog, merely
because we cannot find the domestic dog, or the cultivated wheat, in a
state of nature, we may be next called upon to make similar admissions
in regard to the camel; for it seems very doubtful whether any race of
this species of quadruped is now wild.</p>

<p><i>Changes in plants produced by cultivation.</i>&mdash;But if agriculture, it
will be said, does not supply examples of extraordinary changes of
form and organization, the horticulturist can, at least, appeal to facts
which may confound the preceding train of reasoning. The crab has
been transformed into the apple; the sloe into the plum; flowers
have changed their color, and become double; and these new characters
can be perpetuated by seed; a bitter plant, with wavy sea-green
leaves, has been taken from the sea-side, where it grew like wild charlock;
has been transplanted into the garden, lost its saltness, and has
been metamorphosed into two distinct vegetables, as unlike each other
as is each to the parent plant&mdash;the red cabbage and the cauliflower.
These, and a multitude of analogous facts, are undoubtedly among the
wonders of nature, and attest more strongly, perhaps, the extent to
which species may be modified, than any examples derived from the
animal kingdom. But in these cases we find that we soon reach certain
limits, beyond which we are unable to cause the individuals descending
from the same stock to vary; while, on the other hand, it is easy
to show that these extraordinary varieties could seldom arise, and could
never be perpetuated in a wild state for many generations, under any
imaginable combination of accidents. They may be regarded as extreme
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_589" id="Page_589">589</a></span>
cases, brought about by human interference, and not as phenomena
which indicate a capability of indefinite modification in the
natural world.</p>

<p>The propagation of a plant by buds or grafts, and by cuttings, is
obviously a mode which nature does not employ; and this multiplication,
as well as that produced by roots and layers, seems merely to
operate as an extension of the life of an individual, and not as a reproduction
of the species such as happens by seed. All plants increased
by grafts or layers retain precisely the peculiar qualities of the individual
to which they owe their origin, and, like an individual, they have
only a determinate existence; in some cases longer, and in others
shorter.<a name="FNanchor_812" id="FNanchor_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> It seems now admitted by horticulturists, that none of our
garden varieties of fruit are entitled to be considered strictly permanent,
but that they wear out after a time;<a name="FNanchor_813" id="FNanchor_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a> and we are thus compelled to resort
again to seeds; in which case there is so decided a tendency in the
seedlings to revert to the original type, that our utmost skill is sometimes
baffled in attempting to recover the desired variety.</p>

<p><i>Varieties of the cabbage.</i>&mdash;The different races of cabbages afford, as
was admitted, an astonishing example of deviation from a common
type; but we can scarcely conceive them to have originated, much
less to have lasted for several generations, without the intervention of
man. It is only by strong manures that these varieties have been obtained,
and in poorer soils they instantly degenerate. If, therefore, we
suppose in a state of nature the seed of the wild <i>Brassica oleracea</i> to
have been wafted from the sea-side to some spot enriched by the dung
of animals, and to have there become a cauliflower, it would soon diffuse
its seed to some comparatively sterile soils around, and the offspring
would relapse to the likeness of the parent stock.</p>

<p>But if we go so far as to imagine the soil, in the spot first occupied,
to be constantly manured by herds of wild animals, so as to continue
as rich as that of a garden, still the variety could not be maintained;
because we know that each of these races is prone to fecundate others,
and gardeners are compelled to exert the utmost diligence to prevent
cross-breeds. The intermixture of the pollen of varieties growing in
the poorer soil around would soon destroy the peculiar characters of
the race which occupied the highly manured tract; for, if these accidents
so continually happen, in spite of our care, among the culinary
varieties, it is easy to see how soon this cause might obliterate every
marked singularity in a wild state.</p>

<p>Besides, it is well known that, although the pampered races which
we rear in our gardens for use or ornament may often be perpetuated
by seed, yet they rarely produce seed in such abundance, or so prolific
in quality, as wild individuals; so that if the care of man were withdrawn,
the most fertile variety would always, in the end, prevail over
the more sterile.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_590" id="Page_590">590</a></span>Similar remarks may be applied to the double flowers, which present
such strange anomalies to the botanist. The ovarium, in such cases, is
frequently abortive; and the seeds, when prolific, are generally much
fewer than where the flowers are single.</p>

<p><i>Changes caused by soil.</i>&mdash;Some curious experiments, recently made
on the production of blue instead of red flowers in the <i>Hydrangea
hortensis</i>, illustrate the immediate effect of certain soils on the colors
of the calyx and petals. In garden-mould or compost, the flowers are
invariably red; in some kinds of bog-earth they are blue; and the same
change is always produced by a particular sort of yellow loam.</p>

<p><i>Varieties of the primrose.</i>&mdash;Linn&aelig;us was of opinion that the primrose,
oxlip, cowslip, and polyanthus, were only varieties of the same
species. The majority of the modern botanists, on the contrary, consider
them to be distinct, although some conceived that the oxlip might
be a cross between the cowslip and the primrose. Mr. Herbert has
lately recorded the following experiment:&mdash;"I raised from the natural
seed of one umbel of a highly manured red cowslip a primrose, a
cowslip, oxlips of the usual and other colors, a black polyanthus, a
hose-in-hose cowslip, and a natural primrose bearing its flower on a
polyanthus stalk. From the seed of that very hose-in-hose cowslip
I have since raised a hose-in-hose primrose. I therefore consider all
these to be only local varieties, depending upon soil and situation."<a name="FNanchor_814" id="FNanchor_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a>
Professor Henslow, of Cambridge, has since confirmed this experiment
of Mr. Herbert; so that we have an example, not only of the remarkable
varieties which the florist can obtain from a common stock, but of
the distinctness of analogous races found in a wild state.<a name="FNanchor_815" id="FNanchor_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a></p>

<p>On what particular ingredient, or quality in the earth, these changes
depend, has not yet been ascertained.<a name="FNanchor_816" id="FNanchor_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a> But gardeners are well aware
that particular plants, when placed under the influence of certain circumstances,
are changed in various ways, according to the species; and
as often as the experiments are repeated, similar results are obtained.
The nature of these results, however, depends upon the species, and
they are, therefore, part of the specific character; they exhibit the
same phenomena, again and again, and indicate certain fixed and invariable
relations between the physiological peculiarities of the plant,
and the influence of certain external agents. They afford no ground
for questioning the instability of species, but rather the contrary;
they present us with a class of phenomena, which, when they are more
thoroughly understood, may afford some of the best tests for identifying
species, and proving that the attributes originally conferred endure so
long as any issue of the original stock remains upon the earth.</p>

<h6>WHETHER SPECIES HAVE A REAL EXISTENCE IN NATURE&mdash;<i>continued</i>.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Limits of the variability of species&mdash;Species susceptible of modification may be

domesticity&mdash;Acquired peculiarities which become hereditary have a close connexion

development.]</p></div>

<p><i>Variability of a species compared to that of an individual.</i>&mdash;I
endeavored, in the last chapter, to show, that a belief in the reality
of species is not inconsistent with the idea of a considerable degree
of variability in the specific character. This opinion, indeed, is little
more than an extension of the idea which we must entertain of
the identity of an individual, throughout the changes which it is capable
of undergoing.</p>

<p>If a quadruped, inhabiting a cold northern latitude, and covered
with a warm coat of hair or wool, be transported to a southern climate,
it will often, in the course of a few years, shed a considerable portion
of its coat, which it gradually recovers on being again restored to its
native country. Even there the same changes are, perhaps, superinduced
to a certain extent by the return of winter and summer.
We know that the Alpine hare (<i>Lepus variabilis</i>, Pal.) and the
ermine, or stoat, (<i>Mustela erminea</i>, Linn.) become white during winter,
and again obtain their full color during the warmer season; that the
plumage of the ptarmigan undergoes a like metamorphosis in color
and quantity, and that the change is equally temporary. We
are aware that, if we reclaim some wild animal, and modify its habits
and instincts by domestication, it may, if it escapes, become in a few
years nearly as wild and untractable as ever; and if the same individual
be again retaken, it may be reduced to its former tame state. A plant
is sown in a prepared soil, in order that the petals of its flowers may
multiply, and their color be heightened or changed: if we then withhold
our care, the flowers of this same species become again single. In
these, and innumerable other instances, we must suppose that the
species was produced with a certain number of qualities; and, in the
case of animals, with a variety of instincts, some of which may or may
not be developed according to circumstances, or which, after having
been called forth, may again become latent when the exciting causes are
removed.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_592" id="Page_592">592</a></span>
Now, the formation of races seems the necessary consequence
of such a capability in species to vary, if it be a general law that the
offspring should very closely resemble the parent. But, before
we can infer that there are no limits to the deviation from an original
type which may be brought about in the course of an indefinite
number of generations, we ought to have some proof that, in each
successive generation, individuals may go on acquiring an equal
amount of new peculiarities, under the influence of equal changes
of circumstances. The balance of evidence, however, inclines most
decidedly on the opposite side; for in all cases we find that the quantity
of divergence diminishes after a few generations in a very rapid
ratio.</p>

<p><i>Species susceptible of modification may be greatly altered in a few
generations.</i>&mdash;It cannot be objected, that it is out of our power to go
on varying the circumstances in the same manner as might happen
in the natural course of events during some great geological cycle.
For in the first place, where a capacity is given to individuals to adapt
themselves to new circumstances, it does not generally require a very
long period for its development: if, indeed, such were the case, it is
not easy to see how the modification would answer the ends proposed,
for all the individuals would die before new qualities, habits, or instincts
were conferred.</p>

<p>When we have succeeded in naturalizing some tropical plant in
a temperate climate, nothing prevents us from attempting gradually to
extend its distribution to higher latitudes, or to greater elevations
above the level of the sea, allowing equal quantities of time, or an
equal number of generations, for habituating the species to successive
increments of cold. But every husbandman and gardener is aware
that such experiments will fail; and we are more likely to succeed in
making some plants, in the course of the first two generations, support
a considerable degree of difference of temperature, than a very small
difference afterwards, though we persevere for many centuries.</p>

<p>It is the same if we take any other cause instead of temperature;
such as the quality of the food, or the kind of dangers to which an
animal is exposed, or the soil in which a plant lives. The alteration
in habits, form, or organization, is often rapid during a short period;
but when the circumstances are made to vary farther, though in ever
so slight a degree, all modification ceases, and the individual perishes.
Thus some herbivorous quadrupeds may be made to feed partially on
fish or flesh; but even these can never be taught to live on some herbs
which they reject, and which would even poison them, although the
same may be very nutritious to other species of the same natural order.
So when man uses force or stratagem against wild animals, the persecuted
race soon becomes more cautious, watchful, and cunning; new
instincts seem often to be developed, and to become hereditary in the
first two or three generations: but let the skill and address of man
increase, however gradually, no farther variation can take place, no new
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_593" id="Page_593">593</a></span>
qualities are elicited by the increasing dangers. The alteration of the
habits of the species has reached a point beyond which no ulterior
modification is possible, however indefinite the lapse of ages during
which the new circumstances operate. Extirpation then follows, rather
than such a transformation as could alone enable the species to perpetuate
itself under the new state of things.</p>

<p><i>Animals now subject to man had originally an aptitude to domesticity.</i>&mdash;It
has been well observed by M. F. Cuvier and M. Dureau de
la Malle, that unless some animals had manifested in a wild state an
aptitude to second the efforts of man, their domestication would never
have been attempted. If they had all resembled the wolf, the fox, and
the hy&aelig;na, the patience of the experimentalist would have been
exhausted by innumerable failures before he at last succeeded in obtaining
some imperfect results; so if the first advantages derived from the
cultivation of plants had been elicited by as tedious and costly a process
as that by which we now make some slight additional improvements
in certain races, we should have remained to this day in ignorance
of the greater number of their useful qualities.</p>

<p><i>Acquired instincts of some animals become hereditary.</i>&mdash;It is undoubtedly
true, that many new habits and qualities have not only been
acquired in recent times by certain races of dogs, but have been transmitted
to their offspring. But in these cases it will be observed, that
the new peculiarities have an intimate relation to the habits of the
animal in a wild state, and therefore do not attest any tendency to
a departure to an indefinite extent from the original type of the
species. A race of dogs employed for hunting deer in the platform of
Sante F&eacute;, in Mexico, affords a beautiful illustration of a new hereditary
instinct. The mode of attack, observes M. Roulin, which they employ
consists in seizing the animal by the belly and overturning it by a
sudden effort, taking advantage of the moment when the body of the
deer rests only upon the fore-legs. The weight of the animal thus thrown
over is often six times that of its antagonist. The dog of pure breed
inherits a disposition to this kind of chase, and never attacks a deer
from before while running. Even should the deer, not perceiving him,
come directly upon him, the dog steps aside and makes his assault on
the flank; whereas other hunting dogs, though of superior strength,
and general sagacity, which are brought from Europe, are destitute of
this instinct. For want of similar precautions, they are often killed by
the deer on the spot, the vertebr&aelig; of their neck being dislocated by the
violence of the shock.<a name="FNanchor_817" id="FNanchor_817"></a><a href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a></p>

<p>A new instinct has also become hereditary in a mongrel race of dogs
employed by the inhabitants of the banks of the Magdalena almost
exclusively in hunting the white-lipped pecari. The address of these
dogs consists in restraining their ardor, and attaching themselves to no
animal in particular, but keeping the whole herd in check. Now,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_594" id="Page_594">594</a></span>
among these dogs some are found, which the very first time they are
taken to the woods, are acquainted with this mode of attack; whereas,
a dog of another breed starts forward at once, is surrounded by the
pecari, and, whatever may be his strength, is destroyed in a moment.</p>

<p>Some of our countrymen, engaged of late in conducting one of the
principal mining associations in Mexico, that of Real del Monte, carried
out with them some English greyhounds of the best breed, to hunt the
hares which abound in that country. The great platform which is the
scene of sport is at an elevation of about nine thousand feet above the
level of the sea, and the mercury in the barometer stands habitually at
the height of about nineteen inches. It was found that the greyhounds
could not support the fatigues of a long chase in this attenuated atmosphere,
and before they could come up with their prey, they lay down
gasping for breath; but these same animals have produced whelps
which have grown up, and are not in the least degree incommoded by
the want of density in the air, but run down the hares with as much
ease as the fleetest of their race in this country.</p>

<p>The fixed and deliberate stand of the pointer has with propriety been
regarded as a mere modification of a habit, which may have been useful
to a wild race accustomed to wind game, and steal upon it by surprise,
first pausing for an instant, in order to spring with unerring aim.
The faculty of the retriever, however, may justly be regarded as more
inexplicable and less easily referable to the instinctive passions of the
species. M. Majendie, says a French writer in a recently published
memoir, having learnt that there was a race of dogs in England which
stopped and brought back game of their own accord, procured a
pair, and having obtained a whelp from them, kept it constantly under
his eyes, until he had an opportunity of assuring himself that, without
having received any instruction, and on the very first day that it was
carried to the chase, it brought back game with as much steadiness as
dogs which had been schooled into the same man&oelig;uvre by means of the
whip and collar.</p>

<p><i>Attributes of animals in their relation to man.</i>&mdash;Such attainments, as
well as the habits and dispositions which the shepherd's dog and many
others inherit, seem to be of a nature and extent which we can hardly
explain by supposing them to be modifications of instincts necessary
for the preservation of the species in a wild state. When such remarkable
habits appear in races of this species we may reasonably
conjecture that they were given with no other view than for the use of
man and the preservation of the dog, which thus obtains protection.</p>

<p>As a general rule, I fully agree with M. F. Cuvier, that, in studying
the habits of animals, we must attempt, as far as possible, to refer their
domestic qualities to modifications of instincts which are implanted in
them in a state of nature; and that writer has successfully pointed out,
in an admirable essay on the domestication of the mammalia<a name="FNanchor_818" id="FNanchor_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a>, the true
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_595" id="Page_595">595</a></span>
origin of many dispositions which are vulgarly attributed to the influence
of education alone. But we should go too far if we did not admit
that some of the qualities of particular animals and plants may have
been given solely with a view to the connection which it was foreseen
would exist between them and man&mdash;especially when we see that connexion
to be in many cases so intimate, that the greater number, and
sometimes, as in the case of the camel, all the individuals of the species
which exist on the earth are in subjection to the human race.</p>

<p>We can perceive in a multitude of animals, especially in some of the
parasitic tribes, that certain instincts and organs are conferred for the
purpose of defence or attack against some other species. Now if we
are reluctant to suppose the existence of similar relations between
man and the instincts of many of the inferior animals, we adopt an
hypothesis no less violent, though in the opposite extreme to that which
has led some to imagine the whole animate and inanimate creation to
have been made solely for the support, gratification, and instruction of
mankind.</p>

<p>Many species, most hostile to our persons or property, multiply, in
spite of our efforts to repress them; others, on the contrary, are
intentionally augmented many hundred fold in number by our exertions.
In such instances, we must imagine the relative resources of man, and
of species friendly or inimical to him, to have been prospectively calculated
and adjusted. To withhold assent to this supposition, would be
to refuse what we must grant in respect to the economy of nature in
every other part of the organic creation; for the various species of
contemporary plants and animals have obviously their relative forces,
nicely balanced, and their respective tastes, passions, and instincts so
contrived, that they are all in perfect harmony with each other. In no
other manner could it happen that each species, surrounded, as it is, by
countless dangers, should be enabled to maintain its ground for periods
of considerable duration.</p>

<p>The docility of the individuals of some of our domestic species,
extending, as it does, to attainments foreign to their natural habits and
faculties, may, perhaps, have been conferred with a view to their association
with man. But, lest species should be thereby made to vary
indefinitely, we find that such habits are never transmissible by
generation.</p>

<p>A pig has been trained to hunt and point game with great activity
and steadiness<a name="FNanchor_819" id="FNanchor_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a>; and other learned individuals, of the same species,
have been taught to spell; but such fortuitous acquirements never
become hereditary, for they have no relation whatever to the exigencies
of the animal in a wild state, and cannot, therefore, be developments of
any instinctive propensities.</p>

<p><i>Influence of domestication.</i>&mdash;An animal in domesticity, says M. F.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_596" id="Page_596">596</a></span>
Cuvier, is not essentially in a different situation, in regard to the
feeling of restraint, from one left to itself. It lives in society without
constraint, because, without doubt, it was a social animal; and it conforms
itself to the will of man, because it had a chief, to which, in a
wild state, it would have yielded obedience. There is nothing in its
new situation that is not conformable to its propensities; it is satisfying
its wants by submission to a master, and makes no sacrifice of its
natural inclinations. All the social animals, when left to themselves,
form herds more or less numerous; and all the individuals of the
same herd know each other, are mutually attached, and will not allow
a strange individual to join them. In a wild state, moreover, they
obey some individual, which, by its superiority, has become the chief
of the herd. Our domestic species had, originally, this sociability of
disposition; and no solitary species, however easy it may be <i>to tame
it</i>, has yet afforded true domestic races. We merely, therefore, develope,
to our own advantage, propensities which propel the individuals of
certain species to draw near to their fellows.</p>

<p>The sheep which we have reared is induced to follow us, as it
would be led to follow the flock among which it was brought up; and,
when individuals of gregarious species have been accustomed to one
master, it is he alone whom they acknowledge as their chief&mdash;he only
whom they obey. "The elephant allows himself to be directed only
by the carnac whom he has adopted; the dog itself, reared in solitude
with its master, manifests a hostile disposition towards all others;
and every body knows how dangerous it is to be in the midst of a herd
of cows, in pasturages that are little frequented, when they have not at
their head the keeper who takes care of them.</p>

<p>"Every thing, therefore, tends to convince us, that formerly men
were only with regard to the domestic animals, what those who are
particularly charged with the care of them still are&mdash;namely, members
of the society which these animals form among themselves; and, that
they are only distinguished, in the general mass, by the authority
which they have been enabled to assume from their superiority of intellect.
Thus, every social animal which recognizes man as a member,
and as the chief of its herd, is a domestic animal. It might even be
said, that, from the moment when such an animal admits man as a
member of its society, it is domesticated, as man could not enter into
such society without becoming the chief of it."<a name="FNanchor_820" id="FNanchor_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a></p>

<p>But the ingenious author whose observations I have here cited,
admits that the obedience which the individuals of many domestic
species yield indifferently to every person, is without analogy in any
state of things which could exist previously to their subjugation by
man. Each troop of wild horses, it is true, has some stallion for its
chief, who draws after him all the individuals of which the herd is composed;
but when a domesticated horse has passed from hand to hand,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_597" id="Page_597">597</a></span>
and has served several masters, he becomes equally docile towards <i>any
person</i>, and is subjected to the whole human race. It seems fair to presume
that the capability in the instinct of the horse to be thus modified,
was given to enable the species to render greater services to
man; and, perhaps, the facility with which many other acquired
characters become hereditary in various races of the horse, may be
explicable only on a like supposition. The amble, for example, a
pace to which the domestic races in some parts of Spanish America
are exclusively trained, has, in the course of several generations, become
hereditary, and is assumed by all the young colts before they are
broken in.<a name="FNanchor_821" id="FNanchor_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a></p>

<p>It seems, also, reasonable to conclude, that the power bestowed on
the horse, the dog, the ox, the sheep, the cat, and many species of
domestic fowls, of supporting almost every climate, was given expressly
to enable them to follow man throughout all parts of the
globe, in order that we might obtain their services, and they our protection.
If it be objected that the elephant which, by the union of
strength, intelligence, and docility, can render the greatest services to
mankind, is incapable of living in any but the warmest latitudes, we may
observe that the quantity of vegetable food required by this quadruped
would render its maintenance in the temperate zones too costly, and in
the arctic impossible.</p>

<p>Among the changes superinduced by man, none appear, at first sight,
more remarkable than the perfect tameness of certain domestic races.
It is well known that, at however early an age we obtain possession of
the young of many unreclaimed races, they will retain, throughout life,
a considerable timidity and apprehensiveness of danger; whereas, after
one or two generations, the descendants of the same stock will habitually
place the most implicit confidence in man. There is good reason,
however, to suspect that such changes are not without analogy in a
state of nature; or, to speak more correctly, in situations where man
has not interfered.</p>

<p>We learn from Mr. Darwin, that in the Galapagos archipelago, placed
directly under the equator, and nearly 600 miles west of the American
continent, all the terrestrial birds, as the finches, doves, hawks, and
others, are so tame, that they may be killed with a switch. One day,
says this author, "a mocking bird alighted on the edge of a pitcher
which I held in my hand, and began quietly to sip the water, and
allowed me to lift it with the vessel from the ground." Yet formerly,
when the first Europeans landed, and found no inhabitants in these
islands, the birds were even tamer than now: already they are beginning
to acquire that salutary dread of man which in countries long
settled is natural even to young birds which have never received any
injury. So in the Falkland Islands, both the birds and foxes are entirely
without fear of man; whereas, in the adjoining mainland of South
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_598" id="Page_598">598</a></span>
America, many of the same species of birds are extremely wild; for there
they have for ages been persecuted by the natives.<a name="FNanchor_822" id="FNanchor_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a></p>

<p>Dr. Richardson informs us, in his able history of the habits of the
North American animals, that, "in the retired parts of the mountains
where the hunters had seldom penetrated, there is no difficulty in
approaching the Rocky Mountain sheep, which there exhibit <i>the simplicity
of character so remarkable in the domestic species</i>; but where they
have been often fired at, they are exceedingly wild, alarm their companions,
on the approach of danger, by a hissing noise, and scale the rocks
with a speed and agility that baffle pursuit."<a name="FNanchor_823" id="FNanchor_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a></p>

<p>It is probable, therefore, that as man, in diffusing himself over the
globe, has tamed many wild races, so, also, he has made many tame
races wild. Had some of the larger carnivorous beasts, capable of scaling
the rocks, made their way into the North American mountains
before our hunters, a similar alteration in the instincts of the sheep
would doubtless have been brought about.</p>

<p><i>Wild elephants domesticated in a few years.</i>&mdash;No animal affords a
more striking illustration of the principal points which I have been endeavouring
to establish than the elephant; for, in the first place, the
wonderful sagacity with which he accommodates himself to the society of
man, and the new habits which he contracts, are not the result of time,
nor of modifications produced in the course of many generations.
These animals will breed in captivity, as is now ascertained, in opposition
to the vulgar opinion of many modern naturalists, and in conformity
to that of the ancients &AElig;lian and Columella<a name="FNanchor_824" id="FNanchor_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a>: yet it has always been the
custom, as the least expensive mode of obtaining them, to capture wild
individuals in the forests, usually when full grown; and, in a few years
after they are taken&mdash;sometimes, it is said, in the space of a few months&mdash;their
education is completed.</p>

<p>Had the whole species been domesticated from an early period in the
history of man, like the camel, their superior intelligence would, doubtless,
have been attributed to their long and familiar intercourse with the
lord of the creation; but we know that a few years is sufficient to bring
about this wonderful change of habits; and although the same individual
may continue to receive tuition for a century afterwards, yet it
makes no farther progress in the general development of its faculties.
Were it otherwise, indeed, the animal would soon deserve more than the
poet's epithet of "half-reasoning."</p>

<p>From the authority of our countrymen employed in the late Burmese
war, it appears, in corroboration of older accounts, that when elephants
are required to execute extraordinary tasks, they may be made to understand
that they will receive unusual rewards. Some favourite dainty is
shown to them, in the hope of acquiring which the work is done; and
so perfectly does the nature of the contract appear to be understood,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_599" id="Page_599">599</a></span>
that the breach of it, on the part of the master, is often attended with
danger. In this case, a power has been given to the species to adapt
their social instincts to new circumstances with surprising rapidity; but
the extent of this change is defined by strict and arbitrary limits.
There is no indication of a tendency to continued divergence from
certain attributes with which the elephant was originally endued&mdash;no
ground whatever for anticipating that, in thousands of centuries, any
material alteration could ever be effected. All that we can infer from
analogy is, that some more useful and peculiar races might probably
be formed, if the experiment were fairly tried; and that some individual
characteristic, now only casual and temporary, might be perpetuated
by generation.</p>

<p>In all cases, therefore, where the domestic qualities exist in animals,
they seem to require no lengthened process for their developement;
and they appear to have been wholly denied to some classes, which,
from their strength and social disposition, might have rendered great
services to man; as, for example, the greater part of the quadrumana.
The orang-outang, indeed, which, for its resemblance in form to man,
and apparently for no other good reason, has been assumed by Lamarck
to be the most perfect of the inferior animals, has been tamed by the
savages of Borneo, and made to climb lofty trees, and to bring down
the fruit. But he is said to yield to his masters an unwilling obedience,
and to be held in subjection only by severe discipline. We know
nothing of the faculties of this animal which can suggest the idea that
it rivals the elephant in intelligence; much less anything which can
countenance the dreams of those who have fancied that it might have
been transmuted into the "dominant race." One of the baboons of
Sumatra (<i>Simia carpolegus</i>) appears to be more docile, and is frequently
trained by the inhabitants to ascend trees, for the purpose of gathering
cocoa-nuts; a service in which the animal is very expert. He selects,
says Sir Stamford Raffles, the ripe nuts, with great judgment, and pulls
no more than he is ordered.<a name="FNanchor_825" id="FNanchor_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a> The capuchin and cacajao monkeys are,
according to Humboldt, taught to ascend trees in the same manner,
and to throw down fruit on the banks of the lower Orinoco.<a name="FNanchor_826" id="FNanchor_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a></p>

<p>It is for the Lamarckians to explain how it happens that those same
savages of Borneo have not themselves acquired, by dint of longing, for
many generations, for the power of climbing trees, the elongated arms
of the ourang, or even the prehensile tails of some American monkeys:
Instead of being reduced to the necessity of subjugating stubborn and
untractable brutes, we should naturally have anticipated "that their
wants would have excited them to efforts, and that continued efforts
would have given rise to new organs;" or rather to the re-acquisition
of organs which, in a manner irreconcileable with the principle of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_600" id="Page_600">600</a></span>
<i>progressive</i> system, have grown obsolete in tribes of men which have
such constant need of them.</p>

<p><i>Recapitulation.</i>&mdash;It follows, then, from the different facts which have
been considered in this chapter, that a short period of time is generally
sufficient to effect nearly the whole change which an alteration of external
circumstances can bring about in the habits of a species, and that
such capacity of accommodation to new circumstances is enjoyed in
very different degrees, by different species.</p>

<p>Certain qualities appear to be bestowed exclusively with a view to
the relations which are destined to exist between different species, and,
among others, between certain species and man; but these latter are
always so nearly connected with the original habits and propensities of
each species in a wild state, that they imply no indefinite capacity of
varying from the original type. The acquired habits derived from human
tuition are rarely transmitted to the offspring; and when this happens,
it is almost universally the case with those merely which have
some obvious connexion with the attributes of the species when in a
state of independence.</p>

and bird&mdash;Recapitulation.</p></div>

<p><i>Phenomena of hybrids.</i>&mdash;We have yet to consider another class of phenomena,
those relating to the production of hybrids, which have been
regarded in a very different light with reference to their bearing on the
question of the permanent distinctness of species; some naturalists considering
them as affording the strongest of all proofs in favor of the
reality of species; others, on the contrary, appealing to them as countenancing
the opposite doctrine, that all the varieties of organization and
instinct now exhibited in the animal and vegetable kingdoms may have
been propagated from a small number of original types.</p>

<p>In regard to the mammifers and birds it is found that no sexual
union will take place between races which are remote from each other
in their habits and organization; and it is only in species that are very
nearly allied that such unions produce offspring. It may be laid down
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_601" id="Page_601">601</a></span>
as a general rule, admitting of very few exceptions among quadrupeds,
that the hybrid progeny is sterile; and there seem to be no well
authenticated examples of the continuance of the mule race beyond
one generation. The principal number of observations and experiments
relate to the mixed offspring of the horse and the ass; and
in this case it is well established that the he-mule can generate, and
the she-mule produce. Such cases occur in Spain and Italy, and much
more frequently in the West Indies and New Holland; but these mules
have never bred in cold climates, seldom in warm regions, and still
more rarely in temperate countries.</p>

<p>The hybrid offspring of the she-ass and the stallion, the &#947;&#953;&#957;&#957;&#959;&#962; of
Aristotle, and the hinnus of Pliny, differs from the mule, or the offspring
of the ass and mare. In both cases, says Buffon, these animals
retain more of the dam than of the sire, not only in the magnitude, but
in the figure of the body: whereas, in the form of the head, limbs, and
tail, they bear a greater resemblance to the sire. The same naturalist
infers, from various experiments respecting cross-breeds between the
he-goat and ewe, the dog and she-wolf, the goldfinch and canary-bird,
that the male transmits his sex to the greatest number, and that the
preponderance of males over females exceeds that which prevails where
the parents are of the same species.</p>

<p><i>Hunter's opinion.</i>&mdash;The celebrated John Hunter has observed, that
the true distinction of species must ultimately be gathered from their
incapacity of propagating with each other, and producing offspring
capable of again continuing itself. He was unwilling, however, to admit
that the horse and the ass were of the same species, because some
rare instances had been adduced of the breeding of mules, although he
maintained that the wolf, the dog, and the jackal were all of one species;
because he had found, by two experiments, that the dog would breed
both with the wolf and the jackal; and that the mule, in each case,
would breed again with the dog. In these cases, however, it may be
observed, that there was always one parent at least of pure breed, and
no proof was obtained that a true hybrid race could be perpetuated; a
fact of which I believe no examples are yet recorded, either in regard to
mixtures of the horse and ass, or any other of the mammalia.</p>

<p>Should the fact be hereafter ascertained, that two mules can propagate
their kind, we must still inquire whether the offspring may not be
regarded in the light of a monstrous birth, proceeding from some accidental
cause, or, rather, to speak more philosophically, from some general
law not yet understood, but which may not be permitted permanently
to interfere with those laws of generation by which species may, in
general, be prevented from becoming blended. If, for example, we
discovered that the progeny of a mule race degenerated greatly, in the
first generation, in force, sagacity, or any attribute necessary for its
preservation in a state of nature, we might infer that, like a monster, it
is a mere temporary and fortuitous variety. Nor does it seem probable
that the greater number of such monsters could ever occur unless obtained
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_602" id="Page_602">602</a></span>
by art; for, in Hunter's experiments, stratagem or force was, in
most instances, employed to bring about the irregular connexion.<a name="FNanchor_827" id="FNanchor_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a></p>

<p><i>Mules not strictly intermediate between the parent
species.</i>&mdash;It seems
rarely to happen that the mule offspring is truly intermediate in character
between the two parents. Thus Hunter mentions that, in his
experiments, one of the hybrid pups resembled the wolf much more
than the rest of the litter; and we are informed by Wiegmann, that, in
a litter lately obtained in the Royal Menagerie at Berlin, from a white
pointer and a she-wolf, two of the cubs resembled the common
wolf-dog,
but the third was like a pointer with hanging ears.</p>

<p>There is undoubtedly a very close analogy between these phenomena
and those presented by the intermixture of distinct races of the same
species, both in the inferior animals and in man. Dr. Prichard, in his
"Physical History of Mankind," cites examples where the peculiarities
of the parents have been transmitted very unequally to the offspring;
as where children, entirely white, or perfectly black, have sprung from
the union of the European and the negro. Sometimes the colour or
other peculiarities of one parent, after having failed to show themselves
in the immediate progeny, reappear in a subsequent generation; as
where a white child is born of two black parents, the grandfather having
been a white.<a name="FNanchor_828" id="FNanchor_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a></p>

<p>The same author judiciously observes that, if different species mixed
their breed, and hybrid races were often propagated, the animal world
would soon present a scene of confusion; its tribes would be every where
blended together, and we should perhaps find more hybrid creatures
than genuine and uncorrupted races.<a name="FNanchor_829" id="FNanchor_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a></p>

<p><i>Hybrid plants.</i>&mdash;<i>K&ouml;lreuter's experiments</i>.&mdash;The history of the vegetable
kingdom has been thought to afford more decisive evidence in
favour of the theory of the formation of new and permanent species
from hybrid stocks. The first accurate experiments in illustration of
this curious subject appear to have been made by K&ouml;lreuter, who obtained
a hybrid from two species of tobacco, <i>Nicotiana rustica</i> and <i>N.
paniculata</i>, which differ greatly in the shape of their leaves, the colour
of the corolla, and the height of the stem. The stigma of a plant of <i>N.
rustica</i> was impregnated with the pollen of a plant of <i>N. paniculata</i>.
The seed ripened, and produced a hybrid which was intermediate
between the two parents, and which, like all the hybrids which this
botanist brought up, had imperfect stamens. He afterwards impregnated
this hybrid with the pollen of <i>N. paniculata</i>, and obtained plants
which much more resembled the last. This he continued through
several generations, until, by due perseverance, he actually changed the
<i>Nicotiana rustica</i> into the <i>Nicotiana paniculata</i>.</p>

<p>The plan of impregnation adopted, was the cutting off of the anthers
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_603" id="Page_603">603</a></span>
of the plant intended for fructification before they had shed pollen, and
then laying on foreign pollen upon the stigma.</p>

<p><i>Wiegmann's experiments.</i>&mdash;The same experiment has since been
repeated with success by Wiegmann, who found that he could bring
back the hybrids to the exact likeness of either parent, by crossing them
a sufficient number of times.</p>

<p>The blending of the characters of the parent stocks, in many other
of Wiegmann's experiments, was complete; the colour and shape of the
leaves and flowers, and even the scent, being intermediate, as in the
offspring of the two species of verbascum. An intermarriage, also, between
the common onion and the leek (<i>Allium cepa</i> and <i>A. porrum</i>)
gave a mule plant, which, in the character of its leaves and flowers,
approached most nearly to the garden onion, but had the elongated
bulbous root and smell of the leek.</p>

<p>The same botanist remarks, that vegetable hybrids, when not strictly
intermediate, more frequently approach the female than the male parent
species; <i>but they never exhibit characters foreign to both</i>. A re-cross
with one of the original stocks generally causes the mule plant to revert
towards that stock; but this is not always the case, the offspring sometimes
continuing to exhibit the character of a full hybrid.</p>

<p>In general, the success attending the production and perpetuity of
hybrids among plants depends, as in the animal kingdom, on the degree
of proximity between the species intermarried. If their organization be
very remote, impregnation never takes place; if somewhat less distant,
seeds are formed, but always imperfect and sterile. The next degree of
relationship yields hybrid seedlings, but these are barren; and it is only
when the parent species are very nearly allied that the hybrid race may
be perpetuated for several generations. Even in this case the best authenticated
examples seem confined to the crossing of hybrids with
individuals of pure breed. In none of the experiments most accurately
detailed does it appear that both the parents were mules.</p>

<p>Wiegmann diversified as much as possible his mode of bringing
about these irregular unions among plants. He often sowed parallel
rows, near to each other, of the species from which he desired to breed;
and, instead of mutilating, after K&ouml;lreuter's fashion, the plants of one
of the parent stocks, he merely washed the pollen off their anthers.
The branches of the plants in each row were then gently bent towards
each other and intertwined; so that the wind, and numerous insects, as
they passed from the flowers of one to those of the other species, carried
the pollen and produced fecundation.</p>

<p><i>Vegetable hybrids why rare in a wild slate.</i>&mdash;The same observer saw
a good exemplification of the manner in which hybrids may be formed in
a state of nature. Some wallflowers and pinks had been growing in a
garden, in a dry sunny situation, and their stigmas had been ripened so
as to be moist, and to absorb pollen with avidity, although their anthers
were not yet developed. These stigmas became impregnated by pollen
blown from some other adjacent plants of the same species; but had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_604" id="Page_604">604</a></span>
they been of different species, and not too remote in their organization,
mule races must have resulted.</p>

<p>When, indeed, we consider how busily some insects have been shown
to be engaged in conveying anther-dust from flower to flower, especially
bees, flower-eating beetles, and the like, it seems a most enigmatical
problem how it can happen that promiscuous alliances between distinct
species are not perpetually occurring.</p>

<p>How continually do we observe the bees diligently employed in collecting
the red and yellow powder by which the stamens of flowers are
covered, loading it on their hind legs, and carrying it to their hive for
the purpose of feeding their young! In thus providing for their own
progeny, these insects assist materially the process of fructification.<a name="FNanchor_830" id="FNanchor_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a>
Few persons need be reminded that the stamens in certain plants grow
on different blossoms from the pistils; and unless the summit of the pistil
be touched with the fertilizing dust, the fruit does not swell, nor the
seed arrive at maturity. It is by the help of bees chiefly, that the development
of the fruit of many such species is secured, the powder which
they have collected from the stamens being unconsciously left by them
in visiting the pistils.</p>

<p>How often, during the heat of a summer's day, do we see the males of
di&oelig;cious plants, such as the yew-tree, standing separate from the females,
and sending off into the air, upon the slightest breath of wind, clouds of
buoyant pollen! That the zephyr should so rarely intervene to fecundate
the plants of one species with the anther-dust of others, seems almost to
realize the converse of the miracle believed by the credulous herdsmen
of the Lusitanian mares&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Ore omnes vers&aelig; in Zephyrum, stant rupibus altis</span>
<span class="i0">Exceptantque leves auras: et s&aelig;pe sine ullis</span>
<span class="i0">Conjugiis, vento gravid&aelig;, mirabile dictu.<a name="FNanchor_831" id="FNanchor_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a></span>
</div>
</div>

<p>But, in the first place, it appears that there is a natural aversion in
plants, as well as in animals, to irregular sexual unions; and in most of the
successful experiments in the animal and vegetable world, some violence
has been used in order to procure impregnation. The stigma imbibes,
slowly and reluctantly, the granules of the pollen of another species,
even when it is abundantly covered with it; and if it happen that, during
this period, ever so slight a quantity of the anther-dust of its own
species alight upon it, this is instantly absorbed, and the effect of the
foreign pollen destroyed. Besides, it does not often happen that the
male and female organs of fructification, in different species, arrive at a
state of maturity at precisely the same time. Even where such synchronism
does prevail, so that a cross impregnation is effected, the
chances are very numerous against the establishment of a hybrid race.</p>

<p>If we consider the vegetable kingdom generally, it must be recollected
that even of the seeds which are well ripened, a great part are either
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_605" id="Page_605">605</a></span>
eaten by insects, birds, and other animals, or decay for want of room
and opportunity to germinate. Unhealthy plants are the first which are
cut off by causes prejudicial to the species, being usually stifled by more
vigorous individuals of their own kind. If, therefore, the relative
fecundity or hardiness of hybrids be in the least degree inferior, they
cannot maintain their footing for many generations, even if they were
ever produced beyond one generation in a wild state. In the universal
struggle for existence, the right of the strongest eventually prevails;
and the strength and durability of a race depend mainly on its prolificness,
in which hybrids are acknowledged to be deficient.</p>

<p><i>Centaurea hybrida</i>, a plant which never bears seed, and is supposed
to be produced by the frequent intermixture of two well-known species
of Centaurea, grows wild upon a hill near Turin. <i>Ranunculus lacerus</i>,
also sterile, has been produced accidentally at Grenoble, and near Paris,
by the union of two Ranunculi; but this occurred in gardens.<a name="FNanchor_832" id="FNanchor_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a></p>

<p><i>Mr. Herbert's experiments.</i>&mdash;Mr. Herbert, in one of his ingenious
papers on mule plants, endeavors to account for their non-occurrence
in a state of nature, from the circumstance that all the combinations
that were likely to occur have already been made many centuries ago,
and have formed the various species of botanists; but in our gardens,
he says, whenever species, having a certain degree of affinity to each
other, are transported from different countries, and brought for the first
time into contact, they give rise to hybrid species.<a name="FNanchor_833" id="FNanchor_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a> But we have no
data, as yet, to warrant the conclusion, that a single permanent hybrid
race has ever been formed, even in gardens, by the intermarriage of two
allied species brought from distant habitations. Until some fact of this
kind is fairly established, and a new species, capable of perpetuating
itself in a state of perfect independence of man, can be pointed out, it
seems reasonable to call in question entirely this hypothetical source
of new species. That varieties do sometimes spring up from cross-breeds,
in a natural way, can hardly be doubted; but they probably die
out even more rapidly than races propagated by grafts or layers.</p>

<p><i>Opinion of De Candolle.</i>&mdash;De Candolle, whose opinion on a philosophical
question of this kind deserves the greatest attention, has observed,
in his Essay on Botanical Geography, that the <i>varieties</i> of plants
range themselves under two general heads: those produced by external
circumstances, and those formed by hybridity. After adducing various
arguments to show that neither of these causes can explain the permanent
diversity of plants indigenous in different regions, he says, in regard
to the crossing of races, "I can perfectly comprehend without altogether
sharing the opinion, that, where many species of the same genera occur
near together, hybrid species may be formed, and I am aware that the
great number of species of certain genera which are found in particular
regions may be explained in this manner; but I am unable to conceive
how any one can regard the same explanation as applicable to species
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_606" id="Page_606">606</a></span>
which live naturally at great distances. If the three larches, for example,
now known in the world, lived in the same localities, I might then
believe that one of them was the produce of the crossing of the two
others; but I never could admit that the Siberian species has been produced
by the crossing of those of Europe and America. I see, then,
that there exist in organized beings, permanent differences which cannot
be referred to any one of the actual causes of variation, and these differences
are what constitute species."<a name="FNanchor_834" id="FNanchor_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a></p>

<p><i>Reality of species confirmed by the phenomena of
hybrids.</i>&mdash;The most
decisive arguments perhaps, amongst many others, against the probability
of the derivation of permanent species from cross-breeds, are to be
drawn from the fact alluded to by De Candolle, of species having a
close affinity to each other occurring in distinct botanical provinces, or
countries inhabited by groups of distinct species of indigenous plants;
for in this case naturalists, who are not prepared to go the whole length
of the transmutationists, are under the necessity of admitting that, in
some cases, species which approach very near to each other in their
characters, were so created from their origin; an admission fatal to the
idea of its being a general law of nature that a few original types only
should be formed, and that all intermediate races should spring from
the intermixture of those stocks.</p>

<p>This notion, indeed, is wholly at variance with all that we know of
hybrid generation; for the phenomena entitle us to affirm, that had the
types been at first somewhat distinct, <i>no cross-breeds would ever have
been produced</i>, much less those prolific races which we now recognize as
distinct species.</p>

<p>In regard, moreover, to the permanent propagation of hybrid races
among animals, insuperable difficulties present themselves, when we
endeavor to conceive the blending together of the different instincts and
propensities of two species, so as to insure the preservation of the intermediate
race. The common mule, when obtained by human art, may
be protected by the power of man; but, in a wild state, it would not
have precisely the same wants either as the horse or the ass; and if
in consequence of some difference of this kind, it strayed from the herd,
it would soon be hunted down by beasts of prey, and destroyed.</p>

<p>If we take some genus of insects, such as the bee, we find that each
of the numerous species has some difference in its habits, its mode of
collecting honey, or constructing its dwelling, or providing for its young,
and other particulars. In the case of the common hive bee, the workers
are described, by Kirby and Spence, as being endowed with no less
than thirty distinct instincts.<a name="FNanchor_835" id="FNanchor_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a> So also we find that, amongst a most
numerous class of spiders, there are nearly as many different modes of
spinning their webs as there are species. When we recollect how complicated
are the relations of these instincts with co-existing species, both
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_607" id="Page_607">607</a></span>
of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, it is scarcely possible to imagine
that a bastard race could spring from the union of two of these species,
and retain just so much of the qualities of each parent stock as to preserve
its ground in spite of the dangers which surround it.</p>

<p>We might also ask, if a few generic types alone have been <i>created</i>
among insects, and the intermediate species have proceeded from
hybridity, where are those original types, combining, as they ought to
do, the elements of all the instincts which have made their appearance
in the numerous derivative races? So also in regard to animals of all
classes, and of plants; if species are in general of hybrid origin, where
are the stocks which combine in themselves the habits, properties, and
organs, of which all the intervening species ought to afford us mere
modifications?</p>

<p><i>Recapitulation of the arguments from hybrids.</i>&mdash;I shall now conclude
this subject by summing up, in a few words, the results to which I have
been led by the consideration of the phenomena of hybrids. It appears
that the aversion of individuals of distinct species to the sexual union is
common to animals and plants; and that it is only when the species
approach near to each other in their organization and habits, that any
offspring are produced from their connexion. Mules are of extremely
rare occurrence in a state of nature, and no examples are yet known of
their having procreated in a wild state. But it has been proved, that
hybrids are not universally sterile, provided the parent stocks have a
near affinity to each other, although the continuation of the mixed
race, for several generations, appears hitherto to have been obtained
only by crossing the hybrids with individuals of pure species; an
experiment which by no means bears out the hypothesis that a true
hybrid race could ever be permanently established.</p>

<p>Hence we may infer, that aversion to sexual intercourse is, in general,
a good test of the distinctness of original stocks, or of <i>species</i>; and
the procreation of hybrids is a proof of the near affinity of species. Perhaps,
hereafter, the number of generations for which hybrids may be
continued, before the race dies out (for it seems usually to degenerate
rapidly), may afford the zoologist and botanist an experimental test of
the difference in the degree of affinity of allied species.</p>

<p>I may also remark, that if it could have been shown that a single
permanent species had ever been produced by hybridity (of which there
is no satisfactory proof), it might certainly have lent some countenance
to the notions of the ancients respecting the gradual deterioration of
created things, but none whatever to Lamarck's theory of their progressive
perfectibility, for observations have hitherto shown that there is a
tendency in mule animals and plants to degenerate in organization.</p>

<p>It was before remarked, that the theory of progressive development
arose partly from an attempt to ingraft the doctrines of the transmutationists
upon one of the most popular generalizations in geology. But we
have seen in the ninth chapter, that the modern researches of geologists
have broken at many points the chain of evidence once supposed to exist
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_608" id="Page_608">608</a></span>
in favor of the doctrine, that, at each successive period in the earth's
history, animals and plants of a higher grade, or more complex organization,
have been created. The recent origin of man, and the absence
of all signs of any rational being holding an analogous relation to former
states of the animate world, affords one, and perhaps in the present
state of science the only argument of much weight in support of the
hypothesis of a progressive scheme; but none whatever in favor of the
fancied evolution of one species out of another.</p>

<p><i>Theory of the gradation of intellect as shown by the facial angle.</i>&mdash;When
the celebrated anatomist, Camper, first attempted to estimate the
degrees of sagacity of different animals, and of the races of man, by the
measurement of the facial angle, some speculators were bold enough to
affirm that certain Simi&aelig;, or apes, differed as little from the more
savage races of men, as those do from the human race in general; and
that a scale might be traced from "apes with foreheads villanous low"
to the African variety of the human species, and from that to the European.
The facial angle was measured by drawing a line from the prominent
centre of the forehead to the most advanced part of the lower
jaw-bone, and observing the angle which it made with the horizontal
line; and it was affirmed, that there was a regular series of such angles
from birds to the mammalia.</p>

<p>The gradation from the dog to the monkey was said to be perfect,
and from that again to man. One of the ape tribe has a facial angle of
42&deg;; and another, which approximated nearest to man in figure, an
angle of 50&deg;. To this succeeds (longo sed proximus intervallo) the
head of the African negro, which, as well as that of the Calmuck,
forms an angle of 70&deg;; while that of the European contains 80&deg;. The
Roman painters preferred the angle of 95&deg;; and the character of beauty
and sublimity so striking in some works of Grecian sculpture, as in the
head of the Apollo, and in the Medusa of Sisocles, is given by an angle
which amounts to 100&deg;.<a name="FNanchor_836" id="FNanchor_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a></p>

<p>A great number of valuable facts and curious analogies in comparative
anatomy were brought to light during the investigations which
were made by Camper, John Hunter, and others, to illustrate this scale
of organization; and their facts and generalizations must not be confounded
with the fanciful systems which White and others deduced
from them.<a name="FNanchor_837" id="FNanchor_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a></p>

<p>That there is some connexion between an elevated and capacious
forehead, in certain races of men, and a large developement of the intellectual
faculties, seems highly probable; and that a low facial angle is
frequently accompanied with inferiority of mental powers, is certain;
but the attempt to trace a gradual scale of intelligence through the different
species of animals accompanying the modifications of the form of the
scull, is a mere visionary speculation. It has been found necessary to

exaggerate the sagacity of the ape tribe at the expense of the dog; and
strange contradictions have arisen in the conclusions deduced from the
structure of the elephant; some anatomists being disposed to deny the
quadruped the intelligence which he really possesses, because they
found that the volume of his brain was small in comparison to that of
the other mammalia; while others were inclined to magnify extravagantly
the superiority of his intellect, because the vertical height of his
skull is so great when compared to its horizontal length.</p>

<p><i>Different races of men are all of one species.</i>&mdash;It would be irrelevant
to our subject if we were to enter into a farther discussion on these
topics; because, even if a graduated scale of organization and intelligence
could have been established, it would prove nothing in favor of a tendency,
in each species, to attain a higher state of perfection. I may
refer the reader to the writings of Blumenbach, Prichard, Lawrence, and
more recently Latham<a name="FNanchor_838" id="FNanchor_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a>, for convincing proofs that the varieties of form,
color, and organization of different races of men, are perfectly consistent
with the generally received opinion, that all the individuals of the species
have originated from a single pair; and, while they exhibit in man as
many diversities of a physiological nature as appear in any other species,
they confirm also the opinion of the slight deviation from a common
standard of which species are capable.</p>

<p>The power of existing and multiplying in every latitude, and in every
variety of situation and climate, which has enabled the great human
family to extend itself over the habitable globe, is partly, says Lawrence,
the result of physical constitution, and partly of the mental prerogative
of man. If he did not possess the most enduring and flexible corporeal
frame, his arts would not enable him to be the inhabitant of all climates,
and to brave the extremes of heat and cold, and the other destructive
influences of local situation.<a name="FNanchor_839" id="FNanchor_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a> Yet, notwithstanding this flexibility of
bodily frame, we find no signs of indefinite departure from a common
standard, and the intermarriages of individuals of the most remote
varieties are not less fruitful than between those of the same tribe.</p>

<p><i>Tiedemann on the brain of the f&oelig;tus in vertebrated animals.</i>&mdash;There
is yet another department of anatomical discovery to which I must
allude, because it has appeared to some persons to afford a distant analogy,
at least, to that progressive development by which some of the
inferior species may have been gradually perfected into those of more
complex organization. Tiedemann found, and his discoveries have been
most fully confirmed and elucidated by M. Serres, that the brain of the
f&oelig;tus, in the highest class of vertebrated animals, assumes, in succession,
forms, bearing a certain degree of resemblance to those which belong to
fishes, reptiles, and birds, before it acquires the additions and modifications
which are peculiar to the mammiferous tribe; so that, in the passage
from the embryo to the perfect mammifer, there is a typical representation,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_610" id="Page_610">610</a></span>
it is said, of all those transformations which the primitive species
are supposed to have undergone, during a long series of generations,
between the present period and the remotest geological era.</p>

<p>"If you examine the brain of the mammalia," says M. Serres, "at an
early stage of uterine life, you perceive the cerebral hemispheres consolidated,
as in fish, in two vesicles, isolated one from the other; at a later
period, you see them affect the configuration of the cerebral hemispheres
of reptiles; still later again, they present you with the forms of those of
birds; finally they acquire, at the era of birth, and sometimes later, the
permanent forms which the adult mammalia present.</p>

<p>"The cerebral hemispheres, then, arrive at the state which we observe
in the higher animals only by a series of successive metamorphoses. If
we reduce the whole of these evolutions to four periods, we shall see,
that in the first are born the cerebral lobes of fishes; and this takes place
homogeneously in all classes. The second period will give us the organization
of reptiles; the third, the brain of birds; and the fourth, the
complex hemispheres of mammalia.</p>

<p>"If we could develop the different parts of the brain of the inferior
classes, we should make, in succession, a reptile out of a fish, a bird out
of a reptile, and a mammiferous quadruped out of a bird. If, on the
contrary, we could starve this organ in the mammalia, we might reduce
it successively to the condition of the brain of the three inferior classes.</p>

<p>"Nature often presents us with this last phenomenon in monsters, but
never exhibits the first. Among the various deformities which organized
beings may experience, they never pass the limits of their own classes to
put on the forms of the class above them. Never does a fish elevate
itself so as to assume the form of the brain of a reptile; nor does the
latter ever attain that of birds; nor the bird that of the mammifer. It
may happen that a monster may have two heads; but the conformation
of the brain always remains circumscribed narrowly within the limits of
its class."<a name="FNanchor_840" id="FNanchor_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a></p>

<p>Dr. Clark of Cambridge, in a memoir on "F&oelig;tal Development" (1845),
has shown that the concurrent labours of Valentin, Ratk&eacute;, and Bischoff
disprove the reality of the supposed anatomical analogy between the
embryo condition of certain organs in the higher orders, and the perfect
structure of the same organs in animals of an inferior class. The hearts
and brains, for example, of birds and mammals do not pass through
forms which are permanent in fishes and reptiles; there is only just so
much resemblance as may point to a unity of plan running through the
organization of the whole series of vertebrated animals; but which lends
no support whatever to the notion of a gradual transmutation of one
species into another; least of all of the passage, in the course of many
generations, from an animal of a more simple to one of a more complex
structure.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_611" id="Page_611">611</a></span>
<i>Recapitulation.</i>&mdash;For the reasons, therefore, detailed in this and
the two preceding chapters, we may draw the following inferences in
regard to the reality of <i>species</i> in nature:&mdash;</p>

<p>1st. That there is a capacity in all species to accommodate themselves,
to a certain extent, to a change of external circumstances, this extent
varying greatly, according to the species.</p>

<p>2ndly. When the change of situation which they can endure is great,
it is usually attended by some modifications of the form, colour, size,
structure, or other particulars; but the mutations thus superinduced are
governed by constant laws, and the capability of so varying, forms part
of the permanent specific character.</p>

<p>3dly. Some acquired peculiarities, of form, structure, and instinct, are
transmissible to the offspring; but these consist of such qualities and
attributes only as are intimately related to the natural wants and propensities
of the species.</p>

<p>4thly. The entire variation from the original type, which any given
kind of change can produce, may usually be effected in a brief period of
time, after which no farther deviation can be obtained by continuing to
alter the circumstances, though ever so gradually; indefinite divergence,
either in the way of improvement or deterioration, being prevented, and
the least possible excess beyond the defined limits being fatal to the existence
of the individual.</p>

<p>5thly. The intermixture of distinct species is guarded against by the
aversion of the individuals composing them to sexual union, or by the
sterility of the mule offspring. It does not appear that true hybrid races
have ever been perpetuated for several generations, even by the assistance
of man; for the cases usually cited relate to the crossing of mules with
individuals of pure species, and not to the intermixture of hybrid with
hybrid.</p>

<p>6thly. From the above considerations, it appears that species have a
real existence in nature; and that each was endowed, at the time of its
creation, with the attributes and organization by which it is now distinguished.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XXXVII.</h4>

<h6>LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIES.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Analogy of climate not attended with identity of species&mdash;Botanical geography&mdash;Stations&mdash;Habitations&mdash;Distinct
provinces of indigenous plants&mdash;Vegetation
of islands&mdash;Marine vegetation&mdash;In what manner plants become diffused&mdash;Effects

pass through the stomachs of animals and birds undigested&mdash;Agency of man
in the dispersion of plants, both voluntary and involuntary&mdash;Its analogy to
that of the inferior animals.</p></div>

<p>Next to determining the question whether species have a real existence,
the consideration of the laws which regulate their geographical distribution
is a subject of primary importance to the geologist. It is only by
studying these laws with attention, by observing the positions which
groups of species occupy at present, and inquiring how these may be
varied in the course of time by migrations, by changes in physical geography,
and other causes, that we can hope to learn whether the duration
of species be limited, or in what manner the state of the animate world
is affected by the endless vicissitudes of the inanimate.</p>

<p><i>Different regions inhabited by distinct species.</i>&mdash;That different regions
of the globe are inhabited by entirely distinct animals and plants, is a
fact which has been familiar to all naturalists since Buffon first pointed
out the want of <i>specific</i> identity between the land quadrupeds of America
and those of the Old World. The same phenomenon has, in later times,
been forced in a striking manner upon our attention, by the examination
of New Holland, where the indigenous species of animals and plants were
found to be, almost without exception, distinct from those known in other
parts of the world.</p>

<p>But the extent of this parcelling out of the globe amongst different
<i>nations</i>, as they have been termed, of plants and animals&mdash;the universality
of a phenomenon so extraordinary and unexpected, may be considered as
one of the most interesting facts clearly established by the advance of
modern science.</p>

<p>Scarcely fourteen hundred species of plants appear to have been known
and described by the Greeks, Romans, and Arabians. At present, more
than three thousand species are enumerated, as natives of our own island.<a name="FNanchor_841" id="FNanchor_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a>
In other parts of the world there have been now collected (1846) upwards
of 100,000 species, specimens of which are preserved in European herbariums.
It was not to be supposed, therefore, that the ancients should
have acquired any correct notions respecting what may be called the
geography of plants, although the influence of climate on the character
of the vegetation could hardly have escaped their observation.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_613" id="Page_613">613</a></span>
Antecedently to investigation, there was no reason for presuming that
the vegetable productions, growing wild in the eastern hemisphere,
should be unlike those of the western, in the same latitude; nor that
the plants of the Cape of Good Hope should be unlike those of the
south of Europe; situations where the climate is little dissimilar. The
contrary supposition would have seemed more probable, and we might
have anticipated an almost perfect identity in the animals and plants
which inhabit corresponding parallels of latitude. The discovery, therefore,
that each separate region of the globe, both of the land and water,
is occupied by distinct groups of species, and that most of the exceptions
to this general rule may be referred to disseminating causes now in
operation, is eminently calculated to excite curiosity, and to stimulate
us to seek some hypothesis respecting the first introduction of species
which may be reconcileable with such phenomena.</p>

<p><i>Botanical geography.</i>&mdash;A comparison of the <i>plants</i> of different regions
of the globe affords results more to be depended upon in the present state
of our knowledge than those relating to the animal kingdom, because
the science of botany is more advanced, and probably comprehends a
great proportion of the total number of the vegetable productions of the
whole earth. Humboldt, in several eloquent passages of his Personal
Narrative, was among the first to promulgate philosophical views on this
subject. Every hemisphere, says this traveller, produces plants of different
species; and it is not by the diversity of climates that we can attempt
to explain why equinoctial Africa has no Laurin&aelig;, and the New World
no Heaths; why the Calceolari&aelig; are found only in the southern hemisphere;
why the birds of the continent of India glow with colors less
splendid than the birds of the hot parts of America: finally, why the
tiger is peculiar to Asia, and the ornithorhynchus to New Holland.<a name="FNanchor_842" id="FNanchor_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a></p>

<p>"We can conceive," he adds, "that a small number of the families of
plants, for instance, the Musace&aelig; and the Palms, cannot belong to very
cold regions, on account of their internal structure and the importance of
certain organs; but we cannot explain why no one of the family of
Melastomas vegetates north of the parallel of thirty degrees; or why no
rose-tree belongs to the southern hemisphere. Analogy of climates is
often found in the two continents without identity of productions."<a name="FNanchor_843" id="FNanchor_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a></p>

<p>The luminous essay of De Candolle on "Botanical Geography" presents
us with the fruits of his own researches and those of Humboldt,
Brown, and other eminent botanists, so arranged, that the principal phenomena
of the distribution of plants are exhibited in connexion with the
causes to which they are chiefly referrible.<a name="FNanchor_844" id="FNanchor_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a> "It might not, perhaps, be
difficult," observes this writer, "to find two points, in the United States
and in Europe, or in Equinoctial America and Africa, which present
all the same circumstances: as, for example, the same temperature,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_614" id="Page_614">614</a></span>
the same height above the sea, a similar soil, an equal dose of
humidity; yet nearly all, <i>perhaps all</i>, the plants in these two similar
localities shall be distinct. A certain degree of analogy, indeed, of
aspect, and even of structure, might very possibly be discoverable between
the plants of the two localities in question; but the <i>species</i> would in
general be different. Circumstances, therefore, different from those which
now determine the <i>stations</i>, have had an influence on the <i>habitations</i> of
plants."</p>

<p><i>Stations and habitations of plants.</i>&mdash;As I shall frequently have occasion
to speak of the <i>stations</i> and <i>habitations</i> of plants in the technical
sense in which the terms are used in the above passage, I may remind
the geologist that station indicates the peculiar nature of the locality where
each species is accustomed to grow, and has reference to climate, soil,
humidity, light, elevation above the sea, and other analogous circumstances;
whereas, by habitation is meant a general indication of the
country where a plant grows wild. Thus the <i>station</i> of a plant may be a
salt-marsh, a hill-side, the bed of the sea, or a stagnant pool. Its <i>habitation</i>
may be Europe, North America, or New Holland, between the
tropics. The study of stations has been styled the topography, that of
habitations the geography, of botany. The terms thus defined, express
each a distinct class of ideas, which have been often confounded together,
and which are equally applicable in zoology.</p>

<p>In farther illustration of the principle above alluded to, that difference
of longitude, independently of any influence of temperature, is accompanied
by a great, and sometimes a complete, diversity in the species of
plants, De Candolle observes, that, out of 2891 species of ph&aelig;nogamous
plants described by Pursh, in the United States, there are only 385 which
are found in northern or temperate Europe. MM. Humboldt and Bonpland,
in all their travels through equinoctial America, found only
twenty-four
species (these being all Cyperace&aelig; and Gramine&aelig;) common to America
and any part of the Old World. They collected, it is true, chiefly
on the mountains, or the proportion would have been larger; for Dr. J.
Hooker informs me that many tropical plants of the New World are
identical with African species. Nevertheless, the general discordance of
these Floras is very striking. On comparing New Holland with Europe,
Mr. Brown ascertained that, out of 4100 species, discovered in Australia,
there were only 166 common to Europe, and of this small number there
were some few which may have been transported thither by man. Almost
all of the 166 species were cryptogamic, and the rest consist, in
nearly every case, of ph&aelig;nogamous plants which also inhabit intervening
regions.</p>

<p>But what is still more remarkable, in the more widely separated parts
of the ancient continent, notwithstanding the existence of an uninterrupted
land-communication, the diversity in the specific character of the
respective vegetations is almost as striking. Thus there is found one
assemblage of species in China, another in the countries bordering the
Black Sea and the Caspian, a third in those surrounding the Mediterranean,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_615" id="Page_615">615</a></span>
a fourth in the great platforms of Siberia and Tartary, and so
forth.</p>

<p>The distinctness of the groups of indigenous plants, in the same parallel
of latitude, is greatest where continents are disjoined by a wide expanse
of ocean. In the northern hemisphere, near the pole, where the extremities
of Europe, Asia, and America unite or approach near to one another,
a considerable number of the same species of plants are found, common
to the three continents. But it has been remarked, that these plants,
which are thus so widely diffused in the arctic regions, are also found in
the chain of the Aleutian islands, which stretch almost across from America
to Asia, and which may probably have served as the channel of communication
for the partial blending of the Floras of the adjoining regions.
It has, indeed, been observed to be a general rule, that plants found at
two points very remote from each other occur also in places intermediate.</p>

<p>Dr. J. Hooker informs me that in high latitudes in the southern ocean,
in spite of the great extent of the sea, Floras of widely disconnected islands
contain many species in common. Perhaps icebergs, transporting to vast
distances not only stones, but soil with the seeds of plants, may explain
this unusually wide diffusion of insular plants.</p>

<p>In islands very distant from continents the total number of plants is
comparatively small; but a large proportion of the species are such as
occur nowhere else. In so far as the Flora of such islands is not peculiar
to them, it contains, in general, species common to the nearest main
lands.<a name="FNanchor_845" id="FNanchor_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a> The islands of the great southern ocean exemplify these rules;
the easternmost containing more American, and the western more Indian
plants.<a name="FNanchor_846" id="FNanchor_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a> Madeira and Teneriffe contain many species, and even entire
genera, peculiar to them; but they have also plants in common with
Portugal, Spain, the Azores, and the north-west coast of Africa.<a name="FNanchor_847" id="FNanchor_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a></p>

<p>In the Canaries, out of 533 species of ph&aelig;nogamous plants, it is said
that 310 are peculiar to these islands, and the rest identical with those
of the African continent; but in the Flora of St. Helena, which is so far
distant even from the western shores of Africa, there have been found,
out of thirty native species of the ph&aelig;nogamous class, only <i>one or two</i>
which are to be found in any other part of the globe. On the other
hand, of sixty cryptogamic plants, collected by Dr. J. Hooker in the same
island, twelve only were peculiar.</p>

<p>The natural history of the Galapagos archipelago, described by Mr.
Darwin, affords another very instructive illustration of the laws governing
the geographical distribution of plants and animals in islands. This
group consists of ten principal islands, situated in the Pacific Ocean, under
the equator, about 600 miles westward of the coast of South America.
As they are all formed of volcanic rocks, many of the craters, of which
there are about 2000 in number, having a very fresh aspect, we may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_616" id="Page_616">616</a></span>
regard the whole as much more modern in origin than the mass of the
adjoining continent; yet neither has the Flora nor Fauna been derived from
South America, but consist of species for the most part indigenous, yet
stamped with a character decidedly South American.</p>

<p>What is still more singular, there is a difference between the species
inhabiting the different islands. Of flowering plants, for example, there
are 185 species at present known, and forty cryptogamic, making together
225. One hundred of the former class are new species, probably confined
to this archipelago; and of the rest, ten at least have been introduced by
man. Of twenty-one species of <i>Composit&aelig;</i>, all but one are peculiar, and
they belong to twelve genera, no less than ten of which genera are confined
to the Galapagos. Dr. Hooker observes, that the type of this Flora
has an undoubted relation to that of the western side of South America,
and he detects in it no affinity with that of the numerous islands scattered
over other parts of the Pacific. So in regard to the birds, reptiles,
land-shells, and insects, this archipelago, standing as it does in the Pacific
Ocean, is zoologically part of America. Although each small island is
not more than fifty or sixty miles apart, and most of them are in sight of
each other, formed of precisely the same rocks, rising nearly to an equal
height, and placed under a similar climate, they are tenanted each by a
different set of beings, the tortoises, mocking-thrushes, finches, beetles,
scarcely any of them ever ranging over the whole, and often not even
common to any two of the islands.</p>

<p>"The archipelago," says Mr. Darwin, "is a little world within itself, or
rather a satellite attached to America; whence it has derived a few stray
colonists, and has received the general character of its indigenous productions.
One is astonished," he adds, "at the amount of creative force
displayed on so many small, barren, and rocky islands, and still more so,
at its diverse, yet analogous action on points so near each other. I have
said that the Galapagos archipelago might be called a satellite attached
to America, but it should rather be called a group of satellites physically
similar, organically distinct, yet intimately related to each other, and all
related in a marked, though much lesser degree, to the great American
continent."<a name="FNanchor_848" id="FNanchor_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a></p>

<p><i>Number of botanical provinces.</i>&mdash;De Candolle has enumerated twenty
great botanical provinces inhabited by indigenous or aboriginal plants;
and although many of these contain a variety of species which are common
to several others, and sometimes to places very remote, yet the lines
of demarcation are, upon the whole, astonishingly well defined.<a name="FNanchor_849" id="FNanchor_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a> Nor is
it likely that the bearing of the evidence on which these general views
are founded will ever be materially affected, since they are already confirmed
by the examination of nearly one hundred thousand species of
plants.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_617" id="Page_617">617</a></span>
The entire change of opinion which the contemplation of those phenomena
has brought about is worthy of remark. The first travellers were
persuaded that they should find, in distant regions, the plants of their own
country, and they took a pleasure in giving them the same names. It
was some time before this illusion was dissipated; but so fully sensible did
botanists at last become of the extreme smallness of the number of ph&aelig;nogamous
plants common to different continents, that the ancient Floras
fell into disrepute. All grew diffident of the pretended identifications;
and we now find that every naturalist is inclined to examine each supposed
exception with scrupulous severity.<a name="FNanchor_850" id="FNanchor_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a> If they admit the fact, they begin
to speculate on the mode whereby the seeds may have been transported
from one country into the other, or enquire on which of two continents
the plant was indigenous, assuming that a species, like an individual,
cannot have two birthplaces.</p>

<p><i>Marine vegetation.</i>&mdash;The marine vegetation is divisible into different
systems, like those prevailing on the land; but they are much fewer, as
we might have expected, the temperature of the ocean being more uniform
than that of the atmosphere, and consequently the dispersion of species
from one zone to another being less frequently checked by the intervention
of uncongenial climates. The proportion also of land to sea throughout
the globe being small, the migration of marine plants is not so often
stopped by barriers of land, as is that of the terrestrial species by the
ocean. The number of hydrophytes, as they are termed, is very considerable,
and their stations are found to be infinitely more varied than could
have been anticipated; for while some plants are covered and uncovered
daily by the tide, others live at the depth of several hundred feet. Among
the known provinces of Alg&aelig;, we may mention, 1st, The north circumpolar,
from lat 60&deg; N. to the pole; 2dly, The North Atlantic or the
region of Fucus proper and Delesseri&aelig;, extending from lat. 40&deg; N. to lat.
60&deg; N.; 3dly, That of the Mediterranean, which may be regarded as a
sub-region of the <i>fourth</i> or warmer temperate zone of the Atlantic, between
lat. 23&deg; N. and lat. 40&deg; N.; 5thly, The Tropical Atlantic, in which Sargassum,
Rhodomelia, Corallinea, and Siphonia abound; 6thly, The South
Atlantic, where the Fucus reappears; 7thly, The Antarctic American,
comprehending from Chili to Cape Horn, the Falkland Islands, and thence
round the world south of latitude 50&deg; S.; 8thly, The Australian and New
Zealand, which is very peculiar, being characterized, among other generic
forms, by Cystoseiri&aelig; and Fuce&aelig;; 9thly, The Indian Ocean and Red Sea;
and, 10thly, The Chinese and Japanese seas.<a name="FNanchor_851" id="FNanchor_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a> In addition to the above
provinces, there are several others not yet well determined in the Pacific
Ocean and elsewhere. There are, however, many species which range
through several of these geographical regions of subaqueous vegetation,
being common to very remote countries; as, for example, to the coasts of</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_618" id="Page_618">618</a></span>
Europe and the United States, and others, to Cape Horn and Van Diemen's
Land, the same plants extending also for the most part to the New Zealand
sea. Of the <i>species</i> strictly antarctic (excluding the New Zealand
and Tasmanian groups) Dr. Hooker has identified not less than a fifth part
of the whole with British Alg&aelig;! Yet is there a much smaller proportion
of cosmopolite species among the Alg&aelig; than among the terrestrial cellular
plants, such as lichens, mosses, and Hepatic&aelig;.</p>

<p>It must always be borne in mind, that the distinctness alluded to between
the provinces, whether of subaqueous or terrestrial plants, relates
strictly to <i>species</i>, and not to forms. In regard to the numerical preponderance
of certain forms, and many peculiarities of internal structure,
there is usually a marked agreement in the vegetable productions of districts
placed in corresponding latitudes, and under similar physical circumstances,
however remote their position. Thus there are innumerable
points of analogy between the vegetation of the Brazils, equinoctial Africa,
and India; and there are also points of difference wherein the plants of
these regions are distinguishable from all extra-tropical groups. But there
is a very small proportion of the entire number of species common to the
three continents. The same may be said, if we compare the plants of the
United States with that of the middle of Europe; the species are distinct,
but the forms are often so analogous, as to have been styled "geographical
representatives." There are very few <i>species</i> of ph&aelig;nogamous plants, says
Dr. J. Hooker, common to Van Diemen's Land, New Zealand, and Fuegia,
but a great many <i>genera</i>, and some of them are confined to those three
distant regions of the southern hemisphere, being in many instances each
severally represented by a single species. The same naturalist also
observes that the southern temperate as well as the antarctic regions,
possess each of them representatives of some of the genera of the analogous
climates of the opposite hemisphere; but very few of the species are identical
unless they be such as are equally diffused over other countries, or
which inhabit the Andes, by the aid of which they have evidently effected
their passage southwards.</p>

<p><i>Manner in which plants become diffused.&mdash;Winds.</i>&mdash;Let us now consider
what means of diffusion, independently of the agency of man, are
possessed by plants, whereby, in the course of ages, they may be enabled
to stray from one of the botanical provinces above mentioned to another,
and to establish new colonies at a great distance from their birthplace.</p>

<p>The principal of the inanimate agents provided by nature for scattering
the seeds of plants over the globe, are the movements of the atmosphere
and of the ocean, and the constant flow of water from the mountains to
the sea. To begin with the winds: a great number of seeds, are furnished
with downy and feathery appendages, enabling them, when ripe, to float
in the air, and to be wafted easily to great distances by the most gentle
breeze. Other plants are fitted for dispersion by means of an attached
wing, as in the case of the fir tree, so that they are caught up by the wind
as they fall from the cone, and are carried to a distance. Amongst the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_619" id="Page_619">619</a></span>
comparatively small number of plants known to Linn&aelig;us, no less than 138
genera are enumerated as having winged seeds.</p>

<p>As winds often prevail for days, weeks, or even months together, in the
same direction, these means of transportation may sometimes be without
limits; and even the heavier grains may be borne through considerable
spaces, in a very short time, during ordinary tempests; for strong gales,
which can sweep along grains of sand, often move at the rate of about
forty miles an hour, and if the storm be very violent, at the rate of fifty-six
miles.<a name="FNanchor_852" id="FNanchor_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a> The hurricanes of tropical regions, which root up trees and
throw down buildings, sweep along at the rate of ninety miles an hour;
so that, for however short a time they prevail, they may carry even the
heavier fruits and seeds over friths and seas of considerable width, and
doubtless are often the means of introducing into islands the vegetation
of adjoining continents. Whirlwinds are also instrumental in bearing
along heavy vegetable substances to considerable distances. Slight ones
may frequently be observed in our fields, in summer carrying up haycocks
into the air, and then letting fall small tufts of hay far and wide over
the country; but they are sometimes so powerful as to dry up lakes and
ponds, and to break off the boughs of trees, and carry them up in a
whirling column of air.</p>

<p>Franklin tells us, in one of his letters, that he saw, in Maryland, a
whirlwind which began by taking up the dust which lay in the road, in
the form of a sugar loaf with the pointed end downwards, and soon after
grew to the height of forty or fifty feet, being twenty or thirty in diameter.
It advanced in a direction contrary to the wind; and although the
rotary motion of the column was surprisingly rapid, its onward progress
was sufficiently slow to allow a man to keep pace with it on foot. Franklin
followed it on horseback, accompanied by his son, for three quarters
of a mile, and saw it enter a wood, where it twisted and turned round
large trees with surprising force. These were carried up in a spiral line,
and were seen flying in the air, together with boughs and innumerable
leaves, which, from their height, appeared reduced to the apparent size
of flies. As this cause operates at different intervals of time throughout
a great portion of the earth's surface, it may be the means of bearing not
only plants but insects, land testacea and their eggs, with many other species
of animals, to points which they could never otherwise have reached,
and from which they may then begin to propagate themselves again as
from a new centre.</p>

<p><i>Distribution of cryptogamous plants.</i>&mdash;It has been found that a great
numerical proportion of the exceptions to the limitation of species to
certain quarters of the globe occur in the various tribes of cryptogamic
plants. Linn&aelig;us observed that, as the germs of plants of this class, such
as mosses, fungi, and lichens, consist of an impalpable powder, the particles
of which are scarcely visible to the naked eye, there is no difficulty
to account for their being dispersed throughout the atmosphere, and carried
to every point of the globe, where there is a station fitted for them.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_620" id="Page_620">620</a></span>
Lichens in particular ascend to great elevations, sometimes growing two
thousand feet above the line of perpetual snow, at the utmost limits
of vegetation, and where the mean temperature is nearly at the freezing
point. This elevated position must contribute greatly to facilitate the
dispersion of those buoyant particles of which their fructification consists.<a name="FNanchor_853" id="FNanchor_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a></p>

<p>Some have inferred, from the springing up of mushrooms whenever
particular soils and decomposed organic matter are mixed together, that
the production of fungi is accidental, and not analogous to that of perfect
plants. But Fries, whose authority on these questions is entitled to the
highest respect, has shown the fallacy of this argument in favor of the
old doctrine of equivocal generation. "The sporules of fungi," says this
naturalist, "are so infinite, that in a single individual of <i>Reticularia
maxima</i>, I have counted above ten millions, and so subtile as to be
scarcely visible, often resembling thin smoke; so light that they may be
raised perhaps by evaporation into the atmosphere, and dispersed in so
many ways by the attraction of the sun, by insects, wind, elasticity, adhesion,
&amp;c., that it is difficult to conceive a place from which they may
be excluded."<a name="FNanchor_854" id="FNanchor_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a></p>

<p>The club-moss called <i>Lycopodium cernuum</i> affords a striking example
of a cryptogamous plant universally distributed over all equinoctial countries.
It scarcely ever passes beyond the northern tropic, except in one
instance, where it appears around the hot-springs in the Azores, although
it is neither an inhabitant of the Canaries nor Madeira. Doubtless its
microscopic sporules are everywhere present, ready to germinate on any
spot where they can enjoy throughout the year the proper quantity of
warmth, moisture, light, and other conditions essential to the species.</p>

<p>Almost every lichen brought home from the southern hemisphere by
the antarctic expedition under Sir James Ross, amounting to no less than
200 species, was ascertained to be also an inhabitant of the northern
hemisphere, and almost all of them European.</p>

<p><i>Agency of rivers and currents.</i>&mdash;In considering, in the next place, the
instrumentality of the aqueous agents of dispersion, I cannot do better
than cite the words of one of our ablest botanical writers. "The mountain
stream or torrent," observes Keith, "washes down to the valley the
seeds which may accidentally fall into it, or which it may happen to
sweep from its banks when it suddenly overflows them. The broad and
majestic river, winding along the extensive plain, and traversing the continents
of the world, conveys to the distance of many hundreds of miles
the seeds that may have vegetated at its source. Thus the southern
shores of the Baltic are visited by seeds which grew in the interior of
Germany, and the western shores of the Atlantic by seeds that have been
generated in the interior of America."<a name="FNanchor_855" id="FNanchor_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a> Fruits, moreover, indigenous to
America and the West Indies, such as that of the <i>Mimosa scandens</i>, the
cashewnut and others, have been known to be drifted across the Atlantic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_621" id="Page_621">621</a></span>
by the Gulf stream, on the western coasts of Europe, in such a state
that they might have vegetated had the climate and soil been favourable.
Among these the <i>Guilandina Bonduc</i>, a leguminous plant, is particularly
mentioned, as having been raised from a seed found on the west coast of
Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_856" id="FNanchor_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a></p>

<p>Sir Hans Sloane states, that several kinds of beans cast ashore on the
Orkney Isles, and Ireland, but none of which appear to have naturalized
themselves, are derived from trees which grow in the West Indies, and
many of them in Jamaica. He conjectures that they might have been
conveyed by rivers into the sea, and then by the Gulf stream to greater
distances, in the same manner as the sea-weed called <i>Lenticula marina</i>,
or Sargasso, which grows on the rocks about Jamaica, is known to be
"carried by the winds and current towards the coast of Florida, and thence
into the North American ocean, where it lies very thick on the surface
of the sea."<a name="FNanchor_857" id="FNanchor_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a></p>

<p>The absence of liquid matter in the composition of seeds renders them
comparatively insensible to heat and cold, so that they may be carried
without detriment through climates where the plants themselves would
instantly perish. Such is their power of resisting the effects of heat, that
Spallanzani mentions some seeds that germinated after having been boiled
in water.<a name="FNanchor_858" id="FNanchor_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a> Sir John Herschel informs me that he has sown at the
Cape of Good Hope the seeds of the <i>Acacia lophanta</i> after they had
remained for twelve hours in water of 140&deg; Fahrenheit, and they germinated
far more rapidly than unboiled seeds. He also states that an eminent
botanist, Baron Ludwig, could not get the seeds of a species of cedar
to grow at the Cape till they were thoroughly boiled.</p>

<p>When therefore, a strong gale, after blowing violently off the land for
a time, dies away, and the seeds alight upon the surface of the waters, or
wherever the ocean, by eating away the sea-cliffs, throws down into its
waves plants which would never otherwise reach the shores, the tides and
currents become active instruments in assisting the dissemination of
almost all classes of the vegetable kingdom. The pandanus and many
other plants have been distributed in this way over the islands of the
Pacific. I have before called attention (p. 618.) to the interesting fact
that one-fifth of all the alg&aelig; found in the antarctic regions in 1841-3, by
Dr. J. Hooker, were of species common to the British seas. He has
suggested that cold currents which prevail from Cape Horn to the equator,
and are there met by other cold water, may by their direct influence, as
well as by their temperature, facilitate the passage of antarctic species to
the Arctic Ocean. In like manner the migration of certain marine animals
from the southern to the northern hemisphere may have been brought
about by the same cause.</p>

<p>In a collection of six hundred plants from the neighborhood of the
river Zaire, in Africa, Mr. Brown found that thirteen species were also
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_622" id="Page_622">622</a></span>
met with on the opposite shores of Guiana and Brazil. He remarked
that most of these plants were found only on the lower parts of the river
Zaire, and were chiefly such as produced seeds capable of retaining their
vitality a long time in the currents of the ocean. Dr. J. Hooker informs
me that after an examination of a great many insular floras, he has found
that no one of the large natural orders is so rich in species common to
other countries, as the Leguminos&aelig;. The seeds in this order, which comprises
the largest proportion of widely diffused littoral species, are better
adapted than those of any other plants for water-carriage.</p>

<p><i>The migration of plants aided by islands.</i>&mdash;Islands, moreover, and
even the smallest rocks, play an important part in aiding such migrations;
for when seeds alight upon them from the atmosphere, or are
thrown up by the surf, they often vegetate, and supply the winds and
waves with a repetition of new and uninjured crops of fruit and seeds.
These may afterwards pursue their course through the atmosphere, or
along the surface of the sea, in the same direction. The number of plants
found at any given time on an islet affords us no test whatever of the
extent to which it may have co-operated towards this end, since a variety
of species may first thrive there and then perish, and be followed by other
chance-comers like themselves. If neither St. Helena nor Ascension have
promoted the botanical intercourse between the Old and New Worlds,
we may easily account for the fact by remembering that they are not
only extremely minute and isolated spots, but are also bounded by lofty
and precipitous shores without beaches, where the seeds of foreign species
could readily establish themselves.</p>

<p>Currents and winds in the arctic regions drift along icebergs covered
with an alluvial soil, on which herbs and pine-saplings are seen growing,
which may often continue to vegetate on some distant shore where the
ice-island is stranded.</p>

<p><i>Dispersion of marine plants.</i>&mdash;With respect to marine vegetation, the
seeds, being in their native element, may remain immersed in water without
injury for indefinite periods, so that there is no difficulty in conceiving
the diffusion of species wherever uncongenial climates, contrary currents,
and other causes do not interfere. All are familiar with the sight of the
floating sea-weed,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i05">"Flung from the rock on ocean's foam to sail,</span>
<span class="i0">Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail."</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Remarkable accumulations of that species of sea-weed generally known
as gulf-weed, or sargasso, occur on each side of the equator in the Atlantic,
Pacific, and Indian Oceans. Columbus and other navigators, who first
encountered these banks of alg&aelig; in the Northern Atlantic, compared them
to vast inundated meadows, and state that they retarded the progress of
their vessels. The most extensive bank is a little west of the meridian
of Fayal, one of the Azores, between latitudes 35&deg; and 36&deg;: violent
north-winds sometimes prevail in this space, and drive the sea-weed to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_623" id="Page_623">623</a></span>
low latitudes, as far as the 24th or even the 20th degree.<a name="FNanchor_859" id="FNanchor_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> Along the
northern edge of the Gulf stream Dr. Hooker found <i>Fucus nodosus</i>, and
<i>F. serratus</i>, which he traced all the way from lat. 36&deg; N. to England.</p>

<p>The hollow pod-like receptacle in which the seeds of many alg&aelig; are
lodged, and the filaments attached to the seed-vessels of others, seem
intended to give buoyancy; and I may observe that these hydrophytes
are in general <i>proliferous</i>, so that the smallest fragment of a branch can
be developed into a perfect plant. The seeds, moreover, of the greater
number of species are enveloped with a mucous matter like that which
surrounds the eggs of some fish, and which not only protects them from
injury, but serves to attach them to floating bodies or to rocks.</p>

<p><i>Agency of animals in the distribution of plants.</i>&mdash;But we have as yet
considered part only of the fertile resources of nature for conveying seeds
to a distance from their place of growth. The various tribes of animals
are busily engaged in furthering an object whence they derive such important
advantages. Sometimes an express provision is found in the
structure of seeds to enable them to adhere firmly by prickles, hooks, and
hairs, to the coats of animals, or feathers of the winged tribe, to which
they remain attached for weeks, or even months, and are borne along into
every region whither birds or quadrupeds may migrate. Linn&aelig;us enumerates
fifty genera of plants, and the number now known to botanists is
much greater, which are armed with hooks, by which, when ripe, they
adhere to the coats of animals. Most of these vegetables, he remarks,
require a soil enriched with dung. Few have failed to mark the locks of
wool hanging on the thorn-bushes, wherever the sheep pass, and it is probable
that the wolf or lion never give-chase to herbivorous animals without
being unconsciously subservient to this part of the vegetable economy.</p>

<p>A deer has strayed from the herd when browsing on some rich pasture,
when he is suddenly alarmed by the approach of his foe. He instantly
takes to flight, dashing through many a thicket, and swimming across
many a river and lake. The seeds of the herbs and shrubs which have
adhered to his smoking flanks are washed off again by the waters. The
thorny spray is torn off, and fixes itself in its hairy coat, until brushed off
again in other thickets and copses. Even on the spot where the victim
is devoured many of the seeds which he had swallowed immediately
before the chase may be left on the ground uninjured, and ready to spring
up in a new soil.</p>

<p>The passage, indeed, of undigested seeds through the stomachs of animals
is one of the most efficient causes of the dissemination of plants, and
is of all others, perhaps, the most likely to be overlooked. Few are
ignorant that a portion of the oats eaten by a horse preserve their germinating
faculty in the dung. The fact of their being still nutritious is
not lost on the sagacious rook. To many, says Linn&aelig;us, it seems extraordinary,
and something of a prodigy, that when a field is well tilled and
sown with the best wheat, it frequently produces darnel or the wild oat,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_624" id="Page_624">624</a></span>
especially if it be manured with new dung; they do not consider that
the fertility of the smaller seeds is not destroyed in the stomachs of
animals.<a name="FNanchor_860" id="FNanchor_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a></p>

<p><i>Agency of birds.</i>&mdash;Some birds of the order Passeres devour the seeds
of plants in great quantities, which they eject again in very distant places,
without destroying its faculty of vegetation: thus a flight of larks will fill
the cleanest field with a great quantity of various kinds of plants, as the
melilot trefoil (<i>Medicago lupulina</i>), and others whose seeds are so heavy
that the wind is not able to scatter them to any distance.<a name="FNanchor_861" id="FNanchor_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a> In like manner,
the blackbird and misselthrush, when they devour berries in too great
quantities, are known to consign them to the earth undigested in their
excrement.<a name="FNanchor_862" id="FNanchor_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a></p>

<p>Pulpy fruits serve quadrupeds and birds as food, while their seeds, often
hard and indigestible, pass uninjured through the intestines, and are deposited
far from their original place of growth in a condition peculiarly
fit for vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_863" id="FNanchor_863"></a><a href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a> So well are the farmers, in some parts of England,
aware of this fact, that when they desire to raise a quickset hedge in the
shortest possible time, they feed turkeys with the haws of the common
white-thorn (<i>Crat&aelig;gus Oxyacantha</i>), and then sow the stones which are
ejected in their excrement, whereby they gain an entire year in the growth
of the plant.<a name="FNanchor_864" id="FNanchor_864"></a><a href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> Birds, when they pluck cherries, sloes, and haws, fly away
with them to some convenient place; and when they have devoured the
fruit, drop the stone into the ground. Captain Cook, in his account of
the volcanic island of Tanna, one of the New Hebrides, which he visited
in his second voyage, makes the following interesting
observation:&mdash;"Mr.
Forster, in his botanical excursion this day, shot a pigeon, in the craw of
which was a wild nutmeg."<a name="FNanchor_865" id="FNanchor_865"></a><a href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> It is easy, therefore, to perceive, that birds
in their migrations to great distances, and even across seas, may transport
seeds to new isles and continents.</p>

<p>The sudden deaths to which great numbers of frugivorous birds are
annually exposed must not be omitted as auxiliary to the transportation of
seeds to new habitations. When the sea retires from the shore, and
leaves fruits and seeds on the beach, or in the mud of estuaries, it might,
by the returning tide, wash them away again, or destroy them by long
immersion; but when they are gathered by land birds which frequent the
sea side, or by waders and water-fowl, they are often borne inland; and
if the bird to whose crop they have been consigned is killed, they may be
left to grow up far from the sea. Let such an accident happen but once
in a century, or a thousand years, it will be sufficient to spread many of
the plants from one continent to another; for in estimating the activity
of these causes, we must not consider whether they act slowly in relation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_625" id="Page_625">625</a></span>
to the period of our observation, but in reference to the duration of species
in general.</p>

<p>Let us trace the operation of this cause in connection with others. A
tempestuous wind bears the seeds of a plant many miles through the air,
and then delivers them to the ocean; the oceanic current drifts them to
a distant continent; by the fall of the tide they become the food of numerous
birds, and one of these is seized by a hawk or eagle, which, soaring
across hill and dale to a place of retreat, leaves, after devouring its prey,
the unpalatable seeds to spring up and flourish in a new soil.</p>

<p>The machinery before adverted to, is so capable of disseminating seeds
over almost unbounded spaces, that were we more intimately acquainted
with the economy of nature, we might probably explain all the instances
which occur of the aberration of plants to great distances from their native
countries. The real difficulty which must present itself to every one who
contemplates the present geographical distribution of species, is the small
number of exceptions to the rule of the non-intermixture of different groups
of plants. Why have they not, supposing them to have been ever so distinct
originally, become more blended and confounded together in the
lapse of ages?</p>

<p><i>Agency of man in the dispersion of plants.</i>&mdash;But in addition to all the
agents already enumerated as instrumental in diffusing plants over the
globe, we have still to consider man&mdash;one of the most important of all.
He transports with him, into every region, the vegetables which he cultivates
for his wants, and is the involuntary means of spreading a still
greater number which are useless to him, or even noxious. "When the
introduction of cultivated plants," says De Candolle, "is of recent date,
there is no difficulty in tracing their origin; but when it is of high antiquity,
we are often ignorant of the true country of the plants on which
we feed. No one contests the American origin of the maize or the potatoe;
nor the origin, in the Old World, of the coffee-tree, and of wheat.
But there are certain objects of culture, of very ancient date, between the
tropics, such for example as the banana, of which the origin cannot be
verified. Armies, in modern times, have been known to carry, in all directions,
grain and cultivated vegetables from one extremity of Europe to
the other; and thus have shown us how, in more ancient times, the conquests
of Alexander, the distant expeditions of the Romans, and afterwards
the crusades, may have transported many plants from one part of the
world to the other."<a name="FNanchor_866" id="FNanchor_866"></a><a href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a></p>

<p>But, besides the plants used in agriculture, the numbers which have
been naturalized by accident, or which man has spread unintentionally,
is considerable. One of our old authors, Josselyn, gives a catalogue of
such plants as had, in his time, sprung up in the colony since the English
planted and kept cattle in New England. They were two-and-twenty in
number. The common nettle was the first which the settlers noticed;
and the plantain was called by the Indians "Englishman's foot," as if it
sprung from their footsteps.<a name="FNanchor_867" id="FNanchor_867"></a><a href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_626" id="Page_626">626</a></span>
"We have introduced every where," observes De Candolle, "some
weeds which grow among our various kinds of wheat, and which have
been received, perhaps, originally from Asia along with them. Thus,
together with the Barbary wheat, the inhabitants of the south of Europe
have sown, for many ages, the plants of Algiers and Tunis. With the
wools and cottons of the East, or of Barbary, there are often brought into
France the grains of exotic plants, some of which naturalize themselves.
Of this I will cite a striking example. There is, at the gate of Montpellier,
a meadow set apart for drying foreign wool, <i>after it has been washed</i>.
There hardly passes a year without foreign plants being found naturalized
in this drying-ground. I have gathered there <i>Centaurea parviflora</i>,
<i>Psoralea pal&aelig;stina</i>, and <i>Hypericum crispum</i>." This fact is not only
illustrative of the aid which man lends inadvertently to the propagation
of plants, but it also demonstrates the multiplicity of seeds which are
borne about in the woolly and hairy coats of wild animals.</p>

<p>The same botanist mentions instances of plants naturalized in seaports
by the ballast of ships; and several examples of others which have spread
through Europe from botanical gardens, so as to have become more common
than many indigenous species.</p>

<p>It is scarcely a century, says Linn&aelig;us, since the Canadian erigeron, or
flea-bane, was brought from America to the botanical garden at Paris;
and already the seeds have been carried by the winds so that it is diffused
over France, the British islands, Italy, Sicily, Holland, and Germany.<a name="FNanchor_868" id="FNanchor_868"></a><a href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a>
Several others are mentioned by the Swedish naturalist, as having been
dispersed by similar means. The common thorn-apple (<i>Datura Stramonium</i>),
observes Willdenow, now grows as a noxious weed throughout
all Europe, with the exception of Sweden, Lapland and Russia. It came
from the East Indies and Abyssinia to us, and was thus universally spread
by certain quacks, who used its seeds as an emetic.<a name="FNanchor_869" id="FNanchor_869"></a><a href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> The same plant is
now abundant throughout the greater part of the United States, along
road-sides and about farm-yards. The yellow monkey-flower, <i>Mimulus
luteus</i>, a plant from the north-west region of America, has now established
itself in various parts of England, and is spreading rapidly.</p>

<p>In hot and ill-cultivated countries, such naturalization takes place more
easily. Thus the <i>Chenopodium ambrosioides</i>, sown by Mr. Burchell on a
point of St. Helena, multiplied so fast in four years as to become one of
the commonest weeds in the island, and it has maintained its ground ever
since 1845.<a name="FNanchor_870" id="FNanchor_870"></a><a href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a></p>

<p>The most remarkable proof, says De Candolle, of the extent to which
man is unconsciously the instrument of dispersing and naturalizing species,
is found in the fact, that in New Holland, America, and the Cape
of Good Hope, the aboriginal European species exceed in number all the
others which have come from any distant regions; so that, in this instance,
the influence of man has surpassed that of all the other causes which tend
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_627" id="Page_627">627</a></span>
to disseminate plants to remote districts. Of nearly 1600 British flowering
plants, it is supposed that about 300 species are naturalized; but a
large proportion of these would perish with the discontinuance of agriculture.</p>

<p>Although we are but slightly acquainted, as yet, with the extent of our
instrumentality in naturalizing species, yet the facts ascertained afford no
small reason to suspect that the number which we introduce unintentionally
exceeds all those transported by design. Nor is it unnatural to suppose
that the functions, which the inferior beings, extirpated by man, once
discharged in the economy of nature, should devolve upon the human
race. If we drive many birds of passage from different countries, we are
probably required to fulfil their office of carrying seeds, eggs of fish, insects,
mollusks, and other creatures, to distant regions: if we extirpate quadrupeds,
we must replace them not merely as consumers of the animal and
vegetable substances which they devour, but as disseminators of plants,
and of the inferior classes of the animal kingdom. I do not mean to
insinuate that the very same changes which man brings about, would have
taken place by means of the agency of other species, but merely that he
supersedes a certain number of agents; and so far as he disperses plants
unintentionally, or against his will, his intervention is strictly analogous
to that of the species so extirpated.</p>

<p>I may observe, moreover, that if, at former periods, the animals inhabiting
any given district have been partially altered by the extinction of
some species, and the introduction of others, whether by new creations or
by immigration, a change must have taken place in regard to the particular
plants conveyed about with them to foreign countries. As, for
example, when one set of migratory birds is substituted for another, the
countries from and to which seeds are transported are immediately changed.
Vicissitudes, therefore, analogous to those which man has occasioned,
may have previously attended the springing up of new relations between
species in the vegetable and animal worlds.</p>

<p>It may also be remarked, that if man is the most active agent in enlarging,
so also is he in circumscribing the geographical boundaries of
particular plants. He promotes the migration of some, he retards that
of other species; so that, while in many respects he appears to be exerting
his power to blend and confound the various provinces of indigenous
species, he is, in other ways, instrumental in obstructing the fusion into
one group of the inhabitants of contiguous provinces.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, when two botanical regions exist in the same great
continent, such as <i>the European region</i>, comprehending the central parts
of Europe, and those surrounding the Mediterranean, and <i>the Oriental
region</i>, as it has been termed, embracing the countries adjoining the Black
Sea and the Caspian, the interposition between these of thousands of
square miles of cultivated lands, opposes a new and powerful barrier against
the mutual interchange of indigenous plants. Botanists are well aware
that garden plants naturalize and diffuse themselves with great facility in
comparatively unreclaimed countries, but spread themselves slowly and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_628" id="Page_628">628</a></span>
with difficulty in districts highly cultivated. There are many obvious
causes for this difference; by drainage and culture the natural variety of
stations is diminished, and those stray individuals by which the passage
of a species from one fit station to another is effected, are no sooner detected
by the agriculturist, than they are uprooted as weeds. The larger
shrubs and trees, in particular, can scarcely ever escape observation, when
they have attained a certain size, and will rarely fail to be cut down if
unprofitable.</p>

<p>The same observations are applicable to the interchange of the insects,
birds, and quadrupeds of two regions situated like those above alluded to.
No beasts of prey are permitted to make their way across the intervening
arable tracts. Many birds, and hundreds of insects, which would have
found some palatable food amongst the various herbs and trees of the
primeval wilderness, are unable to subsist on the olive, the vine, the wheat,
and a few trees and grasses favored by man. In addition, therefore, to
his direct intervention, man, in this case, operates indirectly to impede
the dissemination of plants, by intercepting the migration of animals,
many of which would otherwise have been active in transporting seeds
from one province to another.</p>

<p>Whether, in the vegetable kingdom, the influence of man will tend,
after a considerable lapse of ages, to render the geographical range of
<i>species in general</i> more extended, as De Candolle seems to anticipate, or
whether the compensating agency above alluded to will not counterbalance
the exceptions caused by our naturalizations, admits at least of some
doubt. In the attempt to form an estimate on this subject, we must be
careful not to underrate, or almost overlook, as some appear to have done,
the influence of man in checking the diffusion of plants, and restricting
their distribution to narrower limits.</p>

<p><i>Geographical distribution of animals.</i>&mdash;Although in speculating
on "philosophical possibilities," said Buffon, "the same temperature
might have been expected, all other circumstances being equal, to
produce the same beings in different parts of the globe, both in the
animal and vegetable kingdoms, yet it is an undoubted fact, that when
America was discovered, its indigenous quadrupeds were all dissimilar
to those previously known in the Old World. The elephant, the
rhinoceros, the hippopotamus, the camelopard, the camel, the dromedary,
the buffalo, the horse, the ass, the lion, the tiger, the apes, the
baboons, and a number of other mammalia, were nowhere to be met
with on the new continent; while in the old, the American species,
of the same great class, were nowhere to be seen&mdash;the tapir, the lama,
the pecari, the jaguar, the couguar, the agouti, the paca, the coati, and
the sloth."</p>

<p>These phenomena, although few in number relatively to the whole
animate creation, were so striking and so positive in their nature, that
the great French naturalist caught sight at once of a general law in
the geographical distribution of organic beings, namely, the limitation
of groups of distinct species to regions separated from the rest of the
globe by certain natural barriers. It was, therefore, in a truly philosophical
spirit that, relying on the clearness of the evidence obtained
respecting the larger quadrupeds, he ventured to call in question the
identifications announced by some contemporary naturalists of species
of animals said to be common to the southern extremities of America
and Africa.<a name="FNanchor_871" id="FNanchor_871"></a><a href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a></p>

<p>The migration of quadrupeds from one part of the globe to another,
observes Dr. Prichard, is prevented by uncongenial climates and the
branches of the ocean which intersect continents. "Hence, by a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_630" id="Page_630">630</a></span>
reference to the geographical site of countries, we may divide the
earth into a certain number of regions fitted to become the abodes of
particular groups of animals, and we shall find, on inquiry, that each
of these provinces, thus conjecturally marked out, is actually inhabited
by a distinct nation of quadrupeds."<a name="FNanchor_872" id="FNanchor_872"></a><a href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a> It will be observed that the
language of Buffon respecting "natural barriers," which has since
been so popular, would be wholly without meaning if the geographical
distribution of organic beings had not led naturalists to adopt very
generally <i>the doctrine of specific centres</i>, or, in other words, to believe
that each species, whether of plant or animal, originated in a single
birth-place. Reject this view, and the fact that not a single native
quadruped is common to Australia, the Cape of Good Hope, and
South America, can in no ways be explained by adverting to the
wide extent of intervening ocean, or to the sterile deserts, or the great
heat or cold of the climates, through which each species must have
passed, before it could migrate from one of those distant regions to
another. It might fairly be asked of one who talked of impassable
barriers, why the same kangaroos, rhinoceroses, or lamas, should not
have been created simultaneously in Australia, Africa, and South
America! The horse, the ox, and the dog, although foreign to these
countries until introduced by man, are now able to support themselves
there in a wild state, and we can scarcely doubt that many of
the quadrupeds at present peculiar to Australia, Africa, and South
America, might have continued in like manner to inhabit each of the
three continents had they been indigenous or could they once have got
a footing there as new colonists.</p>

<p>At the same time every zoologist will be willing to concede, that
even if the departure of each species from a single centre had not
appeared to be part of the plan of Nature, the range of species in
general must have become limited, under the influence of a variety of
causes, especially in the class of terrestrial mammalia. Scarcely any
one of these could be expected to retain as fair a claim to the title of
cosmopolite as man, although even the human race, fitted as it is by
its bodily constitution and intellectual resources to spread very widely
over the earth, is far from being strictly cosmopolite. It is excluded
both from the arctic and antarctic circles, from many a wide desert
and the summits of many mountain-chains; and lastly, from
three-fourths
of the globe covered by water, where there are large areas
very prolific in animal life, even in the highest order of the vertebrate
class. But the <i>habitations</i> of species are, as before stated, in reference
to plants (see above, p. <a href="#Page_614">614</a>), circumscribed by causes different
from those which determine their <i>stations</i>, and these causes are clearly
connected with the time and place of the original creation of each
species.</p>

<p>As the names and characters of land quadrupeds are much better
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_631" id="Page_631">631</a></span>
known to the general reader than those of other great families of the
animal kingdom, I shall select this class to exemplify the zoological
provinces into which species are divisible, confining myself, however,
to those facts which may help to elucidate some principle, or rule
apparently followed by the Author of Nature, in regard to that
"mystery of mysteries," the first peopling of the earth with living
beings.<a name="FNanchor_873" id="FNanchor_873"></a><a href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a> First, then, the <i>European region</i> comprehends, besides Europe,
the borders of the Mediterranean, and even the north of Africa, and
extends into Asia, beyond the Oural mountains and the Caspian. Although
the species are almost all peculiar, the number of characteristic
<i>genera</i> is remarkably small. The bear, the fox, the hare, the rabbit,
the deer, and almost every European form is found equally in several
of the other large provinces of mammalia, where the species are
distinct. Even the mole (<i>Talpa</i>), although confined to the northern
parts of the old world, ranges eastwards, as far as the Himalaya
mountains.</p>

<p>2dly. The <i>African</i> Fauna, on the other hand, is singularly rich in
generic forms, not met with in a living state in any other region. The
hippopotamus, for example, of which two very distinct species are known,
the giraffe, the Chimpanzee, the blue-faced baboon, the four-fingered
monkeys (<i>Colubus</i>), many carnivora, such as <i>Proteles</i>, allied to the
hy&aelig;na, and a multitude of other forms, are exclusively African. A few
of the species inhabiting the northern confines of this continent, such as
the dromedary, lion, and jackall, are also common to Asia; and a much
larger number of <i>forms</i> belong equally to the great Asiatic province,
the species being distinct. The elephant, for example, of Africa is
smaller, has a rounder head, and larger ears than the Indian one, and
has only three instead of four nails on each hind foot. In like manner,
not one of three African species of Rhinoceros agrees with one of the
three Indian kinds.</p>

<p>3dly. The <i>Southern</i> region of <i>Africa</i>, where that continent extends
into the temperate zone, constitutes another separate zoological province,
surrounded as it is on three sides by the ocean, and cut off from the
countries of milder climate in the northern hemisphere, by the intervening
torrid zone. In many instances, this region contains the same
genera which are found in temperate climates to the northward of the
line: but then the southern are different from the northern species.
Thus, in the south we find the quagga and the zebra; in the north, the
horse, the ass, and the jiggetai of Asia.</p>

<p>The south of Africa is spread out into fine level plains from the tropic
to the Cape. In this region, says Pennant, besides the horse genus, of
which five species have been found, there are also peculiar species of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_632" id="Page_632">632</a></span>
rhinoceros, the hog, and the hyrax, among pachydermatous races; and
amongst the ruminating, the Cape buffalo, and a variety of remarkable
antelopes, as the springbok, the oryx, the gnou, the leucopho&euml;, the
pygarga, and several others.<a name="FNanchor_874" id="FNanchor_874"></a><a href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a></p>

<p>4thly. The assemblage of quadrupeds in <i>Madagascar</i> affords a striking
illustration of the laws before alluded to, as governing the distribution
of species in islands. Separated from Africa by the Mozambique
channel, which is 300 miles wide, Madagascar forms, with two or three
small islands in its immediate vicinity, a zoological province by itself,
all the species except one, and nearly all the genera, being peculiar.
The only exception consists of a small insectivorous quadruped (<i>Centetes</i>),
found also in the Mauritius, to which place it is supposed to have been
taken in ships. The most characteristic feature of this remarkable fauna
consists in the number of quadrumana of the Lemur family, no less than
six genera of these monkeys being exclusively met with in this island,
and a seventh genus of the same, called <i>Galago</i>, which alone has any
foreign representative, being found, as we might from analogy have
anticipated, in the nearest main land. Had the species of quadrupeds
in Madagascar agreed with those of the contiguous parts of Africa, as
do those of England with the rest of Europe, the naturalist would have
inferred that there had been a land communication since the period of
the coming in of the existing quadrupeds, whereas we may now conclude
that the Mozambique channel has constituted an insuperable barrier to
the fusion of the continental fauna with that of the great island during
the whole period that has elapsed since the living species were created.</p>

<p>5thly. Another of the great nations of terrestrial mammalia is that
of <i>India</i>, containing a great variety of peculiar forms, such as the sloth-bear
(<i>Prochilus</i>), the musk-deer (<i>Moscus</i>), the nylghau, the gibbon or
long-armed ape, and many others.</p>

<p>6thly. A portion of the islands of
the <i>Indian archipelago</i> might, perhaps, be considered by some geologists
as an appendage of the same province. In fact, we find in the large
islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo, the same genera, for the most
part, as on the continent of India, and some of the same species, <i>e. g.</i>
the tapir (<i>Tapirus Malayanus</i>), the rhinoceros of Sumatra, and some
others. Most of the species, however, are distinct, and each island has
many, and even a few genera, peculiar to itself. Between eighty and
ninety species are known to inhabit Java, and nearly the same number
occur in Sumatra. Of these, more than half are common to the two
islands. Borneo, which is much less explored, has yielded already
upwards of sixty species, more than half of which are met with either
in Java or Sumatra. Of the species inhabiting Sumatra and not found
in Java, Borneo contains the greater portion. Upon the whole, if these
three large islands were united, and a fusion of their respective indigenous
mammalia should take place, they would present a fauna related
to that of continental India, and comprising about as many species as
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_633" id="Page_633">633</a></span>
we might expect from analogy to discover in an area of equal extent.
The Philippine Islands are peopled with another assemblage of species
generically related to the great Indian type.</p>

<p>7thly. But the islands of Celebes, Amboina, Timor, and <i>New Guinea</i>,
constitute a different region of mammalia more allied to the Australian
type, as having an intermixture of marsupial quadrupeds, yet showing
an affinity also to the Indian in such forms as the deer (<i>Cervus</i>), the
weasel (<i>Viverra</i>), the pig (<i>Sus</i>), the Macaque monkey (<i>Cercopithecus</i>),
and others. As we proceed in a south-westerly direction, from Celebes
to Amboina and thence to New Guinea, we find the Indian types
diminishing in number, and the Australian (<i>i. e.</i> marsupial forms)
increasing. Thus in New Guinea seven species of pouched quadrupeds
have been detected, and among them two singular tree-kangaroos; yet
only one species of the whole seven, viz. the flying opossum (<i>Petauris
ariel</i>), is common to the Indian archipelago and the main land of Australia.
The greater the zoological affinity, therefore, between the latter
and the New Guinea fauna, although it seems in some way connected
with geographical proximity, is not to be explained simply by the
mutual migration of species from the one to the other.</p>

<p>8thly. When <i>Australia</i> was discovered, its land quadrupeds, belonging
almost exclusively to the marsupial or pouched tribe, such as the
kangaroos, wombats, flying opossums, kangaroo-rats, and others, some
feeding on herbs and fruits, others carnivorous, were so novel in their
structure and aspect, that they appeared to the naturalist almost as
strange as if they were the inhabitants of some other planet. We learn
from the recent investigations of Mr. Waterhouse,<a name="FNanchor_875" id="FNanchor_875"></a><a href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a> that no less than
170 species of marsupial quadrupeds have now been determined, and of
the whole number all but thirty-two are exclusively restricted to Australia.
Of these thirty-two, nine belong to the islands in the Indian
archipelago before mentioned, and the other twenty-three are all species
of opossum inhabiting the tropical parts of South America, or a few of
them extending into Mexico and California, and one, the Virginian
opossum, into the United States.</p>

<p>9thly. It only remains for me to say something of the mammiferous
fauna of <i>North</i> and <i>South America</i>. It has often been said that,
where the three continents of Asia, Europe, and North America, approach
very near to each other towards the pole, the whole arctic region
forms one zoological and botanical province. The narrow straits which
separate the old and new world are frozen over in winter, and the distance
is farther lessened by intervening islands. Many plants and animals
of various classes have accordingly spread over all the arctic lands,
being sometimes carried in the same manner as the polar bear, when it
is drifted on floating ice from Greenland to Iceland. But on a close
inspection of the arctic mammalia, it has been found of late years that
a very small number of the American species are identical with those of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_634" id="Page_634">634</a></span>
Europe or Asia. The genera are, in great part, the same or nearly
allied; but the species are rarely identical, and are often very unlike,
as in the case of the American badger and that of Europe. Some of the
<i>genera</i> of arctic America, such as the musk ox (<i>Ovibos</i>), are quite peculiar,
and the distinctness of the fauna of the great continents goes on
increasing in proportion as we trace them southwards, or as they recede
farther from each other, and become more and more separated by the
ocean. At length we find that the three groups of tropical mammalia,
belonging severally to America, Africa, and India, have not a single
species in common.</p>

<p>The predominant influence of climate over all the other causes which
limit the range of species in the mammalia is perhaps nowhere so conspicuously
displayed as in North America. The arctic fauna, so admirably
described by Sir John Richardson, has scarcely any species in common
with the fauna of the state of New York, which is 600 miles farther
south, and comprises about forty distinct mammifers. If again we travel
farther south about 600 miles, and enter another zone, running east and
west, in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and the contiguous states,
we again meet with a new assemblage of land quadrupeds, and this
again differs from the fauna of Texas, where frosts are unknown. It will
be observed that on this continent there are no great geographical
barriers running east and west, such as high snow-clad mountains, barren
deserts, or wide arms of the sea, capable of checking the free migration
of species from north to south. But notwithstanding the distinctness
of those zones of indigenous mammalia, there are some species, such as
the buffalo (<i>Bison Americanus</i>), the racoon (<i>Procyon lotor</i>), and the
Virginian opossum (<i>Didelphis Virginiana</i>), which have a wider habitation,
ranging almost from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico; but they form
exceptions to the general rule. The opossum of Texas (<i>Didelphis
carnivora</i>) is different from that of Virginia, and other species of the
same genus inhabit westward of the Rocky Mountains, in California, for
example, where almost all the mammalia differ from those of the United
States.</p>

<p>10thly. The <i>West Indian</i> land quadrupeds are not numerous, but
several of them are peculiar; and 11thly, <i>South America</i> is the most
distinct, with the exception of Australia, of all the provinces into which
the mammalia can be classed geographically. The various genera of
monkeys, for example, belong to the family Platyrrhini, a large natural
division of the quadrumana, so named from their widely separated nostrils.
They have a peculiar dentition, and many of them prehensile
tails, and are entirely unknown in other quarters of the globe. The
sloths and armadillos, the true blood-sucking bats or vampyres (<i>Phyllostomid&aelig;</i>),
the capybara, the largest of the rodents, the carnivorous coatimondi
(<i>Nasua</i>), and a great many other forms, are also exclusively
characteristic of South America.</p>

<p>"In Peru and Chili," says Humboldt, "the region of the grasses,
which is at an elevation of from 12,300 to 15,400 feet, is inhabited by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_635" id="Page_635">635</a></span>
crowds of lama, guanaco, and alpaca. These quadrupeds, which here
represent the genus camel of the ancient continent, have not extended
themselves either to Brazil or Mexico; because, during their journey,
they must necessarily have descended into regions that were too hot for
them."<a name="FNanchor_876" id="FNanchor_876"></a><a href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a> In this passage it will be seen that the doctrine of "specific
centres" is tacitly assumed.</p>

<p><i>Quadrupeds in Islands.</i>&mdash;Islands remote from continents, especially
those of small size, are either destitute of quadrupeds, except such as
have been conveyed to them by man, or contain species peculiar to
them. In the Galapagos archipelago no indigenous quadrupeds were
found except one mouse, which is supposed to be distinct from any
hitherto found elsewhere. A peculiar species of fox is indigenous in
the Falkland Islands, and a rat in New Zealand, which last country,
notwithstanding its magnitude, is destitute of other mammalia, except
bats, and these, says Dr. Prichard, may have made their way along
the chain of islands which extend from the shores of New Guinea far
into the Southern Pacific. The same author remarks, that among the
various groups of fertile islands in the Pacific, no quadrupeds have
been met with except the rat and a few bats as above mentioned, and
the dog and hog, which appear to have been conveyed thither by the
natives from New Guinea. "Rats are to be found even on some
desert islands, whither they may have been conveyed by canoes which
have occasionally approached the shore. It is known, also, that rats
occasionally swim in large numbers to considerable distances."<a name="FNanchor_877" id="FNanchor_877"></a><a href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a></p>

<p><i>Geographical range of the Cetacea.</i>&mdash;It is natural to suppose that
the geographical range of the different species of Cetacea should be
less correctly ascertained than that of the terrestrial mammifers. It
is, however, well known that the whales which are obtained by our
fishers in the South Seas are distinct from those of the North; and
the same dissimilarity has been found in all the other marine animals,
of the same class, so far as they have yet been studied by naturalists.</p>

<p><i>Dispersion of quadrupeds.</i>&mdash;Let us now inquire what facilities the
various land quadrupeds enjoy of spreading themselves over the surface
of the earth. In the first place, as their numbers multiply, all of them,
whether they feed on plants, or prey on other animals, are disposed to
scatter themselves gradually over as wide an area as is accessible to
them. But before they have extended their migrations over a large
space, they are usually arrested either by the sea, or a zone of uncongenial
climate, or some lofty and unbroken chain of mountains, or a
tract already occupied by a hostile and more powerful species.</p>

<p><i>Their powers of swimming.</i>&mdash;Rivers and narrow friths can seldom
interfere with their progress; for the greater part of them swim well,
and few are without this power when urged by danger and pressing
want. Thus, amongst beasts of prey, the tiger is seen swimming about
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_636" id="Page_636">636</a></span>
among the islands and creeks in the delta of the Ganges, and the
jaguar traverses with ease the largest streams in South America.<a name="FNanchor_878" id="FNanchor_878"></a><a href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a>
The bear, also, and the bison, cross the current of the Mississippi.
The popular error, that the common swine cannot escape by swimming
when thrown into the water, has been contradicted by several curious
and well-authenticated instances during the floods in Scotland of 1829.
One pig, only six months old, after having been carried down from
Garmouth to the bar at the mouth of the Spey, a distance of a quarter
of a mile, swam four miles eastward to Port Gordon, and landed safe.
Three others, of the same age and litter, swam, at the same time, five
miles to the west, and landed at Blackhill.<a name="FNanchor_879" id="FNanchor_879"></a><a href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a></p>

<p>In an adult and wild state, these animals would doubtless have been
more strong and active, and might, when hard pressed, have performed
a much longer voyage. Hence islands remote from the continent may
obtain inhabitants by casualties which, like the late storms in Morayshire,
may only occur once in many centuries, or thousands of years,
under all the same circumstances. It is obvious that powerful tides,
winds, and currents may sometimes carry along quadrupeds capable,
in like manner, of preserving themselves for hours in the sea, to very
considerable distances; and in this way, perhaps, the tapir (<i>Tapir
Indicus</i>) may have become common to Sumatra and the Malayan
peninsula.</p>

<p>To the elephant, in particular, the power of crossing rivers is essential
in a wild state, for the quantity of food which a herd of these animals
consumes renders it necessary that they should be constantly moving
from place to place. The elephant crosses the stream in two ways.
If the bed of the river be hard, and the water not of too great a depth,
he fords it. But when he crosses great rivers, such as the Ganges and
the Niger, the elephant swims deep, so deep, that the end of his trunk
only is out of the water; for it is a matter of indifference to him
whether his body be completely immersed, provided he can bring the
tip of his trunk to the surface, so as to breathe the external air.</p>

<p>Animals of the deer kind frequently take to the water, especially in
the rutting season, when the stags are seen, swimming for several leagues
at a time, from island to island, in search of the does, especially in the
Canadian lakes; and in some countries where there are islands near the
sea-shore, they fearlessly enter the sea and swim to them. In hunting
excursions, in North America, the elk of that country is frequently
pursued for great distances through the water.</p>

<p>The large herbivorous animals, which are gregarious, can never
remain long in a confined region, as they consume so much vegetable
food. The immense herds of bisons (<i>Bos Americanus</i>) which often,
in the great valleys of the Mississippi and its tributaries blacken the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_637" id="Page_637">637</a></span>
surface of the prairie lands, are continually shifting their quarters,
followed by wolves, which prowl about in their rear. "It is no exaggeration,"
says Mr. James, "to assert, that in one place, on the banks
of the Platte, at least ten thousand bisons burst on our sight in an
instant. In the morning, we again sought the living picture; but
upon all the plain, which last evening was so teeming with noble
animals, not one remained."<a name="FNanchor_880" id="FNanchor_880"></a><a href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a></p>

<p><i>Migratory instincts.</i>&mdash;Besides the disposition common to the individuals
of every species slowly to extend their range in search of food,
in proportion as their numbers augment, a migratory instinct often
developes itself in an extraordinary manner, when, after an unusually
prolific season, or upon a sudden scarcity of provisions, great multitudes
are threatened by famine. It may be useful to enumerate some
examples of these migrations, because they may put us upon our
guard against attributing a high antiquity to a particular species merely
because it is diffused over a great space; they show clearly how soon,
in a state of nature, a newly created species might spread itself, in every
direction, from a single point.</p>

<p>In very severe winters, great numbers of the black bears of America
migrate from Canada into the United States; but in milder seasons,
when they have been well fed, they remain and hybernate in the north.<a name="FNanchor_881" id="FNanchor_881"></a><a href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a>
The rein-deer, which, in Scandinavia, can scarcely exist to the south of
the sixty-fifth parallel, descends, in consequence of the greater coldness
of the climate, to the fiftieth degree in Chinese Tartary, and often roves
into a country of more southern latitude than any part of England.</p>

<p>In Lapland, and other high latitudes, the common squirrels, whenever
they are compelled, by want of provisions, to quit their usual abodes,
migrate in amazing numbers, and travel directly forwards, allowing
neither rocks nor forests, nor the broadest waters, to turn them from their
course. Great numbers are often drowned in attempting to pass friths
and rivers. In like manner the small Norway rat sometimes pursues
its migrations in a straight line across rivers and lakes; and Pennant
informs us, that when the rats, in Kamtschatka, become too numerous,
they gather together in the spring, and proceed in great bodies westward,
swimming over rivers, lakes, and arms of the sea. Many are
drowned or destroyed by water-fowl or fish. As soon as they have
crossed the river Penginsk, at the head of the gulf of the same name,
they turn southward, and reach the rivers Judoma and Okotsk by the
middle of July; a district more than 800 miles distant from their point
of departure.</p>

<p>The lemings, also, a small kind of rat, are described as natives of the
mountains of Kolen, in Lapland; and once or twice in a quarter of a
century they appear in vast numbers, advancing along the ground, and
"devouring every green thing." Innumerable bands march from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_638" id="Page_638">638</a></span>
Kolen, through Nordland and Finmark, to the Western Ocean, which
they immediately enter; and after swimming about for some time, perish.
Other bands take their route through Swedish Lapland, to the Bothnian
Gulf, where they are drowned in the same manner. They are followed
in their journeys by bears, wolves, and foxes, which prey upon them incessantly.
They generally move in lines, which are about three feet
from each other, and exactly parallel, going directly forward through
rivers and lakes; and when they meet with stacks of hay or corn, gnawing
their way through them instead of passing round.<a name="FNanchor_882" id="FNanchor_882"></a><a href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> These excursions
usually precede a rigorous winter, of which the lemings seem in
some way forewarned.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 97.</span><a name="f97" id="f97"></a><img src="images/f97.png" width="400" height="206" alt="The Leming, or Lapland Marmot (Mus Lemmus, Linn.)" title="" />

<p class="center2">The Leming, or Lapland Marmot (Mus Lemmus, Linn.)</p></div>

<p>Vast troops of the wild ass, or <i>onager</i> of the ancients, which inhabit
the mountainous deserts of Great Tartary, feed, during the summer, in
the tracts east and north of Lake Aral. In the autumn they collect in
herds of hundreds, and even thousands, and direct their course towards
Persia, to enjoy a warm retreat during winter.<a name="FNanchor_883" id="FNanchor_883"></a><a href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a> Bands of two or three
hundred quaggas, a species of wild ass, are sometimes seen to migrate
from the tropical plains of southern Africa to the vicinity of the Malaleveen
River. During their migrations they are followed by lions, who
slaughter them night by night.<a name="FNanchor_884" id="FNanchor_884"></a><a href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a></p>

<p>The migratory swarms of the springbok, or Cape antelope, afford
another illustration of the rapidity with which a species under certain
circumstances may be diffused over a continent. When the stagnant
pools of the immense deserts south of the Orange River dry up, which
often happens after intervals of three or four years, myriads of these animals
desert the parched soil, and pour down like a deluge on the cultivated
regions near the Cape. The havoc committed by them resembles
that of the African locusts; and so crowded are the herds, that "the
lion has been seen to walk in the midst of the compressed phalanx with
only as much room between him and his victims as the fears of those
immediately around could procure by pressing outwards."<a name="FNanchor_885" id="FNanchor_885"></a><a href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_639" id="Page_639">639</a></span></p>

<p class="center2">Mydaus meliceps, or badger-headed Mydaus. Length, including the tail, 16 inches.</p></div>

<p>Dr. Horsfield mentions a singular fact in regard to the geographical
distribution of the <i>Mydaus meliceps</i>, an animal intermediate between
the polecat and badger. It inhabits Java, and is "confined exclusively
to those mountains which have an elevation of more than seven thousand
feet above the level of the ocean; on these it occurs with the same regularity
as many plants. The long extended surface of Java, abounding
with conical points which exceed this elevation, affords many places
favorable for its resort. On ascending these mountains, the traveller
scarcely fails to meet with this animal, which, from its peculiarities, is
universally known to the inhabitants of these elevated tracts, while to
those of the plains it is as strange to an animal from a foreign county.
In my visits to the mountainous districts, I uniformly met with it; and,
as far as the information of the natives can be relied on, it is found on
all the mountains."<a name="FNanchor_886" id="FNanchor_886"></a><a href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a></p>

<p>Now, if asked to conjecture how the Mydaus arrived at the elevated
regions of each of these isolated mountains, we might say that, before
the island was peopled by man, by whom their numbers are now
thinned, they may occasionally have multiplied so as to be forced to
collect together and migrate: in which case notwithstanding the slowness
of their motions, some few would succeed in reaching another
mountain, some twenty, or even, perhaps, fifty miles distant; for although
the climate of the hot intervening plains would be unfavourable to them,
they might support it for a time, and would find there abundance of
insects on which they feed. Volcanic eruptions, which, at different
times have covered the summits of some of those lofty cones with sterile
sand and ashes, may have occasionally contributed to force on these
migrations.</p>

<p><i>Drifting of animals on ice-floes.</i>&mdash;The power of the terrestrial mammalia
to cross the sea is very limited, and it was before stated that the
same species is scarcely ever common to districts widely separated by
the ocean. If there be some exceptions to this rule, they generally
admit of explanation; for there are natural means whereby some animals
may be floated across the water, and the sea may in the course of ages
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_640" id="Page_640">640</a></span>
wear a wide passage through a neck of land, leaving individuals of a
species on each side of the new channel. Polar bears are known to
have been frequently drifted on the ice from Greenland to Iceland; they
can also swim to considerable distances, for Captain Parry, on the return
of his ships through Barrow's Straits, met with a bear swimming in the
water about midway between the shores, which were about forty miles
apart, and where no ice was in sight.<a name="FNanchor_887" id="FNanchor_887"></a><a href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a> "Near the east coast of Greenland,"
observes Scoresby, "they have been seen on the ice in such
quantities, that they were compared to flocks of sheep on a common;
and they are often found on field-ice, above two hundred miles from the
shore."<a name="FNanchor_888" id="FNanchor_888"></a><a href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a> Wolves, in the arctic regions, often venture upon the ice near
the shore, for the purpose of preying upon young seals which they surprise
when asleep. When these ice-floes get detached, the wolves are
often carried out to sea; and though some may be drifted to islands or
continents, the greater part of them perish, and have been often heard
in this situation howling dreadfully, as they die by famine.<a name="FNanchor_889" id="FNanchor_889"></a><a href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a></p>

<p>During the short summer which visits Melville Island, various plants
push forth their leaves and flowers the moment the snow is off the
ground, and form a carpet spangled with the most lively colours. These
secluded spots are reached annually by herds of musk-oxen and reindeer,
which travel immense distances over dreary and desolate regions,
to graze undisturbed on these luxuriant pastures.<a name="FNanchor_890" id="FNanchor_890"></a><a href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a> The rein-deer often
pass along in the same manner, by the chain of the Aleutian Islands,
from Behring's Straits to Kamtschatka, subsisting on the moss found in
these islands during their passage.<a name="FNanchor_891" id="FNanchor_891"></a><a href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a> But the musk-ox, notwithstanding
its migratory habits, and its long journeys over the ice, does not exist,
either in Asia or Greenland.<a name="FNanchor_892" id="FNanchor_892"></a><a href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a></p>

<p><i>On floating islands of drift-wood.</i>&mdash;Within the tropics there are no
ice-floes; but, as if to compensate for that mode of transportation, there
are floating islets of matted trees, which are often borne along through
considerable spaces. These are sometimes seen sailing at the distance
of fifty or one hundred miles from the mouth of the Ganges, with living
trees standing erect upon them. The Amazon, the Congo, and the
Orinoco, also produce these verdant rafts, which are formed in the
manner already described when speaking of the great raft of the Atchafalaya,
an arm of the Mississippi, where a natural bridge of timber, ten
miles long, and more than two hundred yards wide, existed for more
than forty years, supporting a luxuriant vegetation, and rising and
sinking with the water which flowed beneath it.</p>

<p>On these green islets of the Mississippi, observes Malte-Brun, young
trees take root, and the pistia and nenuphar display their yellow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_641" id="Page_641">641</a></span>
flowers: serpents, birds, and the cayman alligator, come to repose
there, and all are sometimes carried to the sea and engulphed in its
waters.<a name="FNanchor_893" id="FNanchor_893"></a><a href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a></p>

<p>Spix and Martius relate that, during their travels in Brazil, they were
exposed to great danger while ascending the Amazon in a canoe, from
the vast quantity of drift-wood constantly propelled against them by
the current; so much so, that their safety depended on the crew being
always on the alert to turn aside the trunks of trees with long poles.
The tops alone of some trees appeared above water, others had their
roots attached to them with so much soil that they might be compared
to floating islets. On these, say the travellers, we saw some very
singular assemblages of animals, pursuing peacefully their uncertain
way in strange companionship. On one raft were several grave-looking
storks, perched by the side of a party of monkeys, who made comical
gestures, and burst into loud cries, on seeing the canoe. On another
was seen a number of ducks and divers, sitting by a group of squirrels.
Next came down upon the stem of a large rotten cedar tree, an enormous
crocodile, by the side of a tiger-cat, both animals regarding each other
with hostility and mistrust, but the saurian being evidently most at his
ease, as conscious of his superior strength.<a name="FNanchor_894" id="FNanchor_894"></a><a href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a></p>

<p>Similar green rafts, principally composed of canes and brushwood,
are called "camelotes" on the Parana in South America; and they are
occasionally carried down by inundations, bearing on them the tiger,
cayman, squirrels, and other quadrupeds, which are said to be always
terror-stricken on their floating habitation. No less than four tigers
(pumas) were landed in this manner in one night at Monte Video, lat.
35&deg; S., to the great alarm of the inhabitants, who found them prowling
about the streets in the morning.<a name="FNanchor_895" id="FNanchor_895"></a><a href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a></p>

<p>In a memoir lately published, a naval officer relates that, as he
returned from China by the eastern passage, he fell in, among the Moluccas,
with several small floating islands of this kind, covered with mangrove
trees interwoven with underwood. The trees and shrubs retained
their verdure, receiving nourishment from a stratum of soil which formed
a white beach round the margin of each raft, where it was exposed to
the washing of the waves and the rays of the sun.<a name="FNanchor_896" id="FNanchor_896"></a><a href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">896</a> The occurrence
of soil in such situations may easily be explained; for all the natural
bridges of timber which occasionally connect the islands of the Ganges,
Mississippi, and other rivers, with their banks, are exposed to floods of
water, densely charged with sediment.</p>

<p>Captain W. H. Smyth informs me, that, when cruising in the Cornwallis
amidst the Philippine Islands, he has more than once seen, after
those dreadful hurricanes called typhoons, floating masses of wood, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_642" id="Page_642">642</a></span>
trees growing upon them, and ships have sometimes been in imminent
peril, as often as these islands were mistaken for terra firma, when, in
fact, they were in rapid motion.</p>

<p>It is highly interesting to trace, in imagination, the effects of the
passage of these rafts from the mouth of a large river to some archipelago,
such as those in the South Pacific, raised from the deep, in comparatively
modern times, by the operations of the volcano and the earthquake,
and the joint labours of coral animals and testacea. If a storm
arise, and the frail vessel be wrecked, still many a bird and insect may
succeed in gaining, by flight, some island of the newly formed group,
while the seeds and berries of herbs and shrubs, which fall into the
waves, may be thrown upon the strand. But if the surface of the deep
be calm, and the rafts are carried along by a current, or wafted by some
slight breath of air fanning the foliage of the green trees, it may arrive,
after a passage of several weeks, at the bay of an island, into which its
plants and animals may be poured out as from an ark, and thus a colony
of several hundred new species may at once be naturalized.</p>

<p>The reader should be reminded, that I merely advert to the transportation
of these rafts as of extremely rare and accidental occurrence; but
it may account, in tropical countries, for some of the rare exceptions to
the general law of the confined range of mammiferous species.</p>

<p><i>Migrations of the Cetacea.</i>&mdash;Many of the Cetacea, the whales of the
northern seas for example, are found to desert one tract of the sea, and
to visit another very distant, when they are urged by want of food, or
danger. The seals also retire from the coast of Greenland in July, return
again in September, and depart again in March, to return in June. They
proceed in great droves northwards, directing their course where the sea
is most free from ice, and are observed to be extremely fat when they
set out on this expedition, and very lean when they come home again.<a name="FNanchor_897" id="FNanchor_897"></a><a href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a></p>

<p><i>Species of the Mediterranean, Black Sea, and Caspian identical.</i>&mdash;Some
naturalists have wondered that the sea-calves, dolphins, and other
marine mammalia of the Mediterranean and Black Sea, should be identical
with those found in the Caspian: and among other fanciful theories,
they have suggested that they may dive through subterranean conduits,
and thus pass from one sea into the other. But as the occurrence of
wolves and other noxious animals, on both sides of the British Channel,
was adduced, by Verstegan and Desmarest, as one of many arguments
to prove that England and France were once united; so the correspondence
of the aquatic species of the inland seas of Asia with those of the
Black Sea tend to confirm the hypothesis, for which there are abundance
of independent geological data, that those seas were connected together
by straits at no remote period of the earth's history.</p>

<h5><i>Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Birds.</i></h5>

<p>I shall now offer a few observations on some of the other divisions of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_643" id="Page_643">643</a></span>
the animal kingdom. Birds, notwithstanding their great locomotive
powers, form no exception to the general rules already laid down; but,
in this class, as in plants and terrestrial quadrupeds, different groups of
species are circumscribed within definite limits. We find, for example,
one assemblage in the Brazils, another in the same latitudes in Central
Africa, another in India, and a fourth in New Holland. Of twenty-six
different species of land birds found in the Galapagos archipelago, all,
with the exception of one, are distinct from those inhabiting other parts
of the globe;<a name="FNanchor_898" id="FNanchor_898"></a><a href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a> and in other archipelagos a single island sometimes contains
a species found in no other spot on the whole earth; as is exemplified
in some of the parrot tribes. In this extensive family, which are,
with few exceptions, inhabitants of tropical regions, the American group
has not one in common with the African, nor either of these with the
parrots of India.<a name="FNanchor_899" id="FNanchor_899"></a><a href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a></p>

<p>Another illustration is afforded by that minute and beautiful tribe,
the humming-birds. The whole of them are, in the first place, peculiar
to the new world; but some species are confined to Mexico, while
others exist only in some of the West India Islands, and have not
been found elsewhere in the western hemisphere. Yet there are species
of this family which have a vast range, as the <i>Trochilus flammifrons</i>
(or <i>Mellisuga Kingii</i>), which is found over a space of 2500
miles on the west coast of South America, from the hot dry country
of Lima to the humid forests of Tierra del Fuego. Captain King,
during his survey in the years 1826-30, found this bird at the Straits
of Magellan, in the month of May&mdash;the depth of winter&mdash;sucking the
flowers of a large species of fuchsia, then in bloom, in the midst of a
shower of snow.</p>

<p>The ornithology of our own country affords one well-known and
striking exemplification of the law of a limited specific range; for the
common grouse (<i>Tetra scoticus</i>) occurs nowhere in the known world
except in the British isles.</p>

<p>Some species of the vulture tribe are said to be cosmopolites; and
the common wild goose (<i>Anas anser</i>, Linn.), if we may believe some
ornithologists, is a general inhabitant of the globe, being met with from
Lapland to the Cape of Good Hope, frequent in Arabia, Persia, China,
and Japan, and in the American continent from Hudson's Bay to South
Carolina.<a name="FNanchor_900" id="FNanchor_900"></a><a href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a> An extraordinary range has also been attributed to the
nightingale, which extends from western Europe to Persia, and still farther.
In a work entitled Specchio Comparativo,<a name="FNanchor_901" id="FNanchor_901"></a><a href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a> by Charles Bonaparte,
many species of birds are enumerated as common to Rome and Philadelphia:
the greater part of these are migratory, but some of them,
such as the long-eared owl (<i>Strix otus</i>), are permanent in both countries.
The correspondence of the ornithological fauna of the eastern and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_644" id="Page_644">644</a></span>
western hemispheres increases considerably, as might have been anticipated,
in high northern latitudes.<a name="FNanchor_902" id="FNanchor_902"></a><a href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a></p>

<p><i>Their facilities of diffusion.</i>&mdash;In parallel zones of the northern and
southern hemispheres, a great general correspondence of form is
observable, both in the aquatic and terrestrial birds; but there is rarely
any specific identity; and this phenomenon is truly remarkable, when
we recollect the readiness with which some birds, not gifted with great
powers of flight, shift their quarters to different regions, and the facility
with which others, possessing great strength of wing, perform their
a&euml;rial voyage. Some migrate periodically from high latitudes, to avoid
the cold of winter, and the accompaniments of cold,&mdash;scarcity of insects
and vegetable food; others, it is said, for some particular kinds of nutriment
required for rearing their young: for this purpose they often traverse
the ocean for thousands of miles, and recross it at other periods,
with equal security.</p>

<p>Periodical migrations, no less regular, are mentioned by Humboldt,
of many American water-fowl, from one part of the tropics to another,
in a zone where there is the same temperature throughout the year.
Immense flights of ducks leave the valley of the Orinoco, when the
increasing depth of its waters and the flooding of its shores prevent
them from catching fish, insects, and aquatic worms. They then betake
themselves to the Rio Negro and Amazon, having passed from the
eighth and third degrees of north latitude to the first and fourth of south
latitude, directing their course south-south-east. In September, when
the Orinoco decreases and re-enters its channel, these birds return northwards.<a name="FNanchor_903" id="FNanchor_903"></a><a href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a></p>

<p>The insectivorous swallows which visit our island would perish during
winter, if they did not annually repair to warmer climes. It is supposed
that in these aerial excursions the average rapidity of their flight is not
less than fifty miles an hour; so that, when aided by the wind, they
soon reach warmer latitudes. Spallanzani calculated that the swallow
can fly at the rate of ninety-two miles an hour, and conceived that the
rapidity of the swift might be three times greater.<a name="FNanchor_904" id="FNanchor_904"></a><a href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a> The rate of flight
of the eider duck (<i>Anas mollissima</i>) is said to be ninety miles an hour;
and Bachman says that the hawk, wild pigeon (<i>Columba migratoria</i>),
and several species of wild ducks, in North America, fly at the rate of
forty miles an hour, or nearly a thousand miles in twenty-four hours.<a name="FNanchor_905" id="FNanchor_905"></a><a href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a></p>

<p>When we reflect how easily different species, in a great lapse of ages,
may be each overtaken by gales and hurricanes, and, abandoning themselves
to the tempest, be scattered at random through various regions
of the earth's surface, where the temperature of the atmosphere, the
vegetation, and the animal productions, might be suited to their wants,
we shall be prepared to find some species capriciously distributed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_645" id="Page_645">645</a></span>
to be sometimes unable to determine the native countries of each.
Captain Smyth informs me, that, when engaged in his survey of the
Mediterranean, he encountered a gale in the Gulf of Lyons, at the distance
of between twenty and thirty leagues from the coast of France,
which bore along many land birds of various species, some of which
alighted on the ship, while others were thrown with violence against the
sails. In this manner islands become tenanted by species of birds
inhabiting the nearest mainland.</p>

<h5><i>Geographical Distribution and Dissemination of Reptiles.</i></h5>

<p>A few facts respecting the third great class of vertebrated animals
will suffice to show that the plan of nature in regard to their location
on the globe is perfectly analogous to that already exemplified in other
parts of the organic creation, and has probably been determined by
similar causes.</p>

<p><i>Habitations of reptiles.</i>&mdash;Of the great saurians, the gavials which
inhabit the Ganges differ from the cayman of America, or the crocodile
of the Nile. The monitor of New Holland is specifically distinct from
the Indian species; these latter, again, from the African, and all from
their congeners in the new world. So in regard to snakes; we find the
boa of America represented by the python, a different though nearly
allied genus in India. America is the country of the rattlesnake;
Africa, of the cerastes; and Asia, of the hooded snake, or cobra di
capello. The amphibious genera Siren and Menopoma belong to North
America, possessing both lungs and gills, and respiring at pleasure
either air or water. The only analogous animal of the old world is
the <i>Proteus anguinus</i> of the lakes of Lower Carniola, and the grotto of
Adelsberg between Trieste and Vienna.<a name="FNanchor_906" id="FNanchor_906"></a><a href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a></p>

<p>There is a legend that St. Patrick expelled all reptiles from Ireland;
and certain it is that none of the three species of snakes common in
England, nor the toad, have been observed there by naturalists. They
have our common frog, and our water-newt, and according to Ray
(Quad. 264.), the green lizard (<i>Lacerta viridis</i>).</p>

<p><i>Migrations of the larger reptiles.</i>&mdash;The range of the large reptiles is,
in general, quite as limited as that of some orders of the terrestrial
mammalia. The great saurians sometimes cross a considerable tract in
order to pass from one river to another; but their motions by land are
generally slower than those of quadrupeds. By water, however, they
may transport themselves to distant situations more easily. The larger
alligator of the Ganges sometimes descends beyond the brackish water
of the delta into the sea; and in such cases it might chance to be
drifted away by a current, and survive till it reached a shore at some
distance; but such casualties are probably very rare.</p>

<p>Turtles migrate in large droves from one part of the ocean to another
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_646" id="Page_646">646</a></span>
during the ovipositing season; and they find their way annually to the
island of Ascension, from which the nearest land is about 800 miles
distant. Dr. Fleming mentions, that an individual of the hawk's bill
turtle (<i>Chelonia imbricata</i>), so common in the American seas, has been
taken at Papa Stour, one of the West Zetland Islands;<a name="FNanchor_907" id="FNanchor_907"></a><a href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a> and, according
to Sibbald, "the same animal came into Orkney." Another was taken,
in 1774, in the Severn, according to Turton. Two instances, also, of
the occurrence of the leathern tortoise (<i>C. coriacea</i>), on the coast of
Cornwall, in 1756, are mentioned by Borlase. These animals of more
southern seas can be considered only as stragglers, attracted to our
shores during uncommonly warm seasons by an abundant supply of food,
or carried by the Gulf stream, or driven by storms to high latitudes.</p>

<p>Some of the smaller reptiles lay their eggs on aquatic plants; and
these must often be borne rapidly by rivers, and conveyed to distant
regions in a manner similar to the dispersion of seeds before adverted to.
But that the larger ophidians may be themselves transported across the
seas, is evident from the following most interesting account of the arrival
of one at the island of St. Vincent. It is worthy of being recorded, says
Mr. Guilding, "that a noble specimen of the <i>Boa constrictor</i> was lately
conveyed to us by the currents, twisted round the trunk of a large sound
cedar tree, which had probably been washed out of the bank by the
floods of some great South American river, while its huge folds hung on
the branches, as it waited for its prey. The monster was fortunately
destroyed after killing a few sheep, and his skeleton now hangs before
me in my study, putting me in mind how much reason I might have had
to fear in my future rambles through the forests of St. Vincent, had this
formidable reptile been a pregnant female, and escaped to a safe retreat."<a name="FNanchor_908" id="FNanchor_908"></a><a href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a></p>

<h5><i>Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Fish.</i></h5>

<p>Although we are less acquainted with the habitations of marine animals
than with the grouping of the terrestrial species before described, yet it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_647" id="Page_647">647</a></span>
is well ascertained that their distribution is governed by the same general
laws. The testimony borne by MM. P&eacute;ron and Lesueur to this important
fact is remarkably strong. These eminent naturalists, after collecting and
describing many thousand species of marine animals which they brought
to Europe from the southern hemisphere, insist most emphatically on
their distinctness from those north of the equator; and this remark they
extend to animals of all classes, from those of a more simple to those of
a more complex organization&mdash;from the sponges and Medus&aelig; to the
Cetacea. "Among all those which we have been able to examine," say
they, "with our own eyes, or with regard to which it has appeared to us
possible to pronounce with certainty, there is not a single animal of the
southern regions which is not distinguished by essential characters from
the analogous species in the northern seas."<a name="FNanchor_909" id="FNanchor_909"></a><a href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a></p>

<p>On comparing the freshwater fish of Europe and North America, Sir
John Richardson remarks, that the only species which is unequivocally
common to the two continents is the pike (<i>Esox lucius</i>); and it is curious
that this fish is unknown to the westward of the Rocky Mountains, the
very coast which approaches nearest to the old continent.<a name="FNanchor_910" id="FNanchor_910"></a><a href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a> According
to the same author the genera of freshwater fish in China agree closely
with those of the peninsula of India, but the species are not the same.
"As in the distribution," he adds, "of marine fish, the interposition of a
continent stretching from the tropics far into the temperate or colder
parts of the ocean, separate different ichthyological groups; so with respect
to the freshwater species, the intrusion of arms of the sea running far to
the northwards, or the interposition of a lofty mountain-chain, effects the
same thing. The freshwater fish of the Cape of Good Hope and the
South American ones, are different from those of India and China, &amp;c."<a name="FNanchor_911" id="FNanchor_911"></a><a href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a></p>

<p>Cuvier and Valenciennes, in their "Histoire des Poissons," observe,
that very few species of fish cross the Atlantic. Although their statement
is correct, it is found that a great many species are common to the
opposite sides of the Indian Ocean, inhabiting alike the Red Sea, the
eastern coast of Africa, Madagascar, the Mauritius, the Indian Ocean,
the southern seas of China, the Malay archipelago, the northern coasts
of Australia, and the whole of Polynesia!<a name="FNanchor_912" id="FNanchor_912"></a><a href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a> This very wide diffusion,
says Sir J. Richardson, may have been promoted by chains of islands
running east and west, which are wanting in the deep Atlantic. An
archipelago extending far in longitude, favours the migration of fish by
multiplying the places of deposit for spawn along the shores of islands,
and on intervening coral banks; and in such places, also, fish find their
appropriate food.</p>

<p>The flying fish are found (some stragglers excepted) only between the
tropics: in receding from the line, they never approach a higher latitude
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_648" id="Page_648">648</a></span>
than the fortieth parallel. The course of the Gulf stream, however, and
the warmth of its water, enable some tropical fish to extend their habitations
far into the temperate zone; thus the ch&aelig;todons which abound in
the seas of hot climates, are found among the Bermudas on the thirty-second
parallel, where they are preserved in basins inclosed from the sea,
as an important article of food for the garrison and inhabitants. Other
fish, following the direction of the same great current, range from the
coast of Brazil to the banks of Newfoundland.<a name="FNanchor_913" id="FNanchor_913"></a><a href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a></p>

<p>All are aware that there are certain fish of passage which have their
periodical migrations, like some tribes of birds. The salmon, towards
the season of spawning, ascends the rivers for hundreds of miles, leaping
up the cataracts which it meets in its course, and then retreats again
into the depths of the ocean. The herring and the haddock, after frequenting
certain shores, in vast shoals, for a series of years, desert them
again, and resort to other stations, followed by the species which prey on
them. Eels are said to descend into the sea for the purpose of producing
their young, which are seen returning into the fresh water by myriads,
extremely small in size, but possessing the power of surmounting every
obstacle which occurs in the course of a river, by applying their slimy
and glutinous bodies to the surface of rocks, or the gates of a lock, even
when dry, and so climbing over it.<a name="FNanchor_914" id="FNanchor_914"></a><a href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a> Before the year 1800 there were no
eels in Lake Wener, the largest inland lake in Sweden, which discharges
its waters by the celebrated cataracts of Trolh&auml;ttan. But I am informed
by Professor Nilsson, that since the canal was opened uniting the river
Gotha with the lake by a series of nine locks, each of great height, eels
have been observed in abundance in the lake. It appears, therefore, that
though they were unable to ascend the falls, they have made their way
by the locks, by which in a very short space a difference of level of 114
feet is overcome.</p>

<p>Gmelin says, that the Anseres (wild geese, ducks, and others) subsist,
in their migrations, on the spawn of fish; and that oftentimes, when
they void the spawn, two or three days afterwards, the eggs retain their
vitality unimpaired.<a name="FNanchor_915" id="FNanchor_915"></a><a href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a> When there are many disconnected freshwater
lakes in a mountainous region, at various elevations, each remote from
the other, it has often been deemed inconceivable how they could all
become stocked with fish from one common source; but it has been suggested,
that the minute eggs of these animals may sometimes be entangled
in the feathers of water-fowl. These, when they alight to wash
and plume themselves in the water, may often unconsciously contribute
to propagate swarms of fish, which, in due season, will supply
them with food. Some of the water-beetles, also, as the Dyticid&aelig;, are
amphibious, and in the evening quit their lakes and pools, and, flying in
the air, transport the minute ova of fishes to distant waters. In this
manner some naturalists account for the fry of fish appearing occasionally
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_649" id="Page_649">649</a></span>
in small pools caused by heavy rains; but the showers of small fish,
stated in so many accounts to have fallen from the atmosphere, require
farther investigation.</p>

<h5><i>Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Testacea.</i></h5>

<p>The Testacea, of which so great a variety of species occurs in the sea,
are a class of animals of peculiar importance to the geologist; because
their remains are found in strata of all ages, and generally in a higher
state of preservation than those of other organic beings. Climate has
a decided influence on the geographical distribution of species in this
class; but as there is much greater uniformity of temperature in the
waters of the ocean, than in the atmosphere which invests the land, the
diffusion of marine mollusks is on the whole more extensive.</p>

<p>Some forms attain their fullest development in warm latitudes; and
are often exclusively confined to the torrid zone, as <i>Nautilus</i>, <i>Harpa</i>,
<i>Terebellum</i>, <i>Pyramidella</i>, <i>Delphinula</i>, <i>Aspergillum</i>, <i>Tridacna</i>, <i>Cucull&aelig;a</i>,
<i>Crassatella</i>, <i>Corbis</i>, <i>Perna</i>, and <i>Plicatula</i>. Other forms are limited to
one region of the sea, as the <i>Trigonia</i> to parts of Australia, and the
<i>Concholepas</i> to the western coast of South America. The marine species
inhabiting the ocean on the opposite sides of the narrow isthmus of
Panama, are found to differ almost entirely, as we might have anticipated,
since a West Indian mollusk cannot enter the Pacific without
coasting round South America, and passing through the inclement climate
of Cape Horn. The continuity of the existing lines of continent
from north to south, prevents any one species from belting the globe, or
from following the direction of the isothermal lines.</p>

<p>Currents also flowing permanently in certain directions, and the influx
at certain points of great bodies of fresh water, limit the extension of
many species. Those which love deep water are arrested by shoals;
others, fitted for shallow seas, cannot migrate across unfathomable abysses.
The nature also of the ground has an important influence on the
testaceous fauna, both on the land and beneath the waters. Certain
species prefer a sandy, others a gravelly, and some a muddy sea-bottom.
On the land, limestone is of all rocks the most favourable to the number
and propagation of species of the genera Helix, Clausilia, Bulimus, and
others. Professor E. Forbes has shown as the result of his labours in
dredging in the &AElig;gean Sea, that there are eight well-marked regions of
depth, each characterized by its peculiar testaceous fauna. The first of
these, called the littoral zone, extends to a depth of two fathoms only;
but this narrow belt is inhabited by more than one hundred species.
The second region, of which ten fathoms is the inferior limit, is almost
equally populous; and a copious list of species is given as characteristic
of each region down to the seventh, which lies between the depths
of 80 and 105 fathoms, all the inhabited space below this being included
in the eighth province, where no less than 65 species of Testacea have
been taken. The majority of the shells in this lowest zone are white or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_650" id="Page_650">650</a></span>
transparent. Only two species of Mollusca are common to all the eight
regions, namely, <i>Arca lactea</i> and <i>Cerithium lima</i>.<a name="FNanchor_916" id="FNanchor_916"></a><a href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a></p>

<p><i>Great range of some provinces and species.</i>&mdash;In Europe conchologists
distinguish between the arctic fauna, the southern boundary of which
corresponds with the isothermal line of 32&deg; F., and the Celtic, which,
commencing with that limit as its northern frontier, extends southwards
to the mouth of the English Channel and Cape Finisterre, in France.
From that point begins the Lusitanian fauna, which, according to the
recent observations of Mr. M'Andrew (1852), ranges to the Canary
Islands. The Mediterranean province is distinct from all those above
enumerated, although it has some species in common with each.</p>

<p>The Indo-Pacific region is by far the most extensive of all. It reaches
from the Red Sea and the eastern coast of Africa, to the Indian Archipelago,
and adjoining parts of the Pacific Ocean. To the geologist it
furnishes a fact of no small interest, by teaching us that one group of
living species of mollusca may prevail throughout an area exceeding in
magnitude the utmost limits we can as yet assign to any assemblage of
contemporaneous fossil species. Mr. Cuming obtained more than a
hundred species of shells from the eastern coast of Africa identical with
those collected by himself at the Philippines and in the eastern coral
islands of the Pacific Ocean, a distance equal to that from pole to pole.<a name="FNanchor_917" id="FNanchor_917"></a><a href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a></p>

<p>Certain species of the genus <i>Ianthina</i> have a very wide range, being
common to seas north and south of the equator. They are all provided
with a beautifully contrived float, which renders them buoyant, facilitating
their dispersion, and enabling them to become active agents in disseminating
other species. Captain King took a specimen of <i>Ianthina fragilis</i>,
alive, a little north of the equator, so loaded with barnacles (<i>Pentelasmis</i>)
and their ova that the upper part of its shell was invisible. The "Rock
Whelk" (<i>Purpura lapillus</i>), a well-known British univalve, inhabits
both the North Atlantic and North Pacific.</p>

<p><i>Helix putris</i> (<i>Succinea putris</i>, Lam.), so common in Europe, where it
reaches from Norway to Italy, is also said to occur in the United States
and in Newfoundland. As this animal inhabits constantly the borders of
pools and streams where there is much moisture, it is not impossible that
different water-fowl have been the agents of spreading some of its
minute eggs, which may have been entangled in their feathers. The
freshwater snail, <i>Lymneus palustris</i>, so abundant in English ponds,
ranges uninterruptedly from Europe to Cashmere, and thence to the
eastern parts of Asia. <i>Helix aspersa</i>, one of the commonest of our
larger land-shells, is found in St. Helena and other distant countries.
Some conchologists have conjectured that it was accidentally imported into
St. Helena in some ship; for it is an eatable species, and these animals are
capable of retaining life during long voyages, without air or nourishment.<a name="FNanchor_918" id="FNanchor_918"></a><a href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_651" id="Page_651">651</a></span>
Perhaps no species has a better claim to be called cosmopolite than
one of our British bivalves, <i>Saxicava rugosa</i>. It is spread over all the
north-polar seas, and ranges in one direction through Europe to Senegal,
occurring on both sides of the Atlantic; while in another it finds its way
into the North Pacific, and thence to the Indian Ocean. Nor do its
migrations cease till it reaches the Australian seas.</p>

<p>A British brachiopod, named <i>Terebratula caput-serpentis</i>, is common,
according to Professor E. Forbes, to both sides of the North Atlantic,
and to the South African and Chinese seas.</p>

<p><i>Confined range of other species.</i>&mdash;Mr. Lowe, in a memoir published
in the Cambridge Transactions in 1834, enumerates seventy-one species
of land Mollusca, collected by him in the islands of Madeira and Porto
Santo, sixty of which belonged to the genus Helix alone, including as
sub-genera Bulimus and Achatina, and excluding Vitrina and Clausilia;
forty-four of these are new. It is remarkable that very few of the
above-mentioned species are common to the neighbouring archipelago of
the Canaries; but it is a still more striking fact, that of the sixty species
of the three genera above mentioned, thirty-one are natives of Porto
Santo; whereas, in Madeira, which contains ten times the superficies,
were found but twenty-nine. Of these only four were common to the
two islands, which are separated by a distance of only twelve leagues;
and two even of these four (namely <i>Helix rhodostoma</i> and <i>H. ventrosa</i>)
are species of general diffusion, common to Madeira, the Canaries, and
the south of Europe.<a name="FNanchor_919" id="FNanchor_919"></a><a href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a></p>

<p>The confined range of these mollusks may easily be explained, if we
admit that species have only one birth-place; and the only problem to be
solved would relate to the exceptions&mdash;to account for the dissemination
of some species throughout several islands, and the European continent.
May not the eggs, when washed into the sea by the undermining of
cliffs, or blown by a storm from the land, float uninjured to a distant shore?</p>

<p><i>Their mode of diffusion.</i>&mdash;Notwithstanding the proverbially slow
motion of snails and mollusks in general, and although many aquatic
species adhere constantly to the same rock for their whole lives, they are
by no means destitute of provision for disseminating themselves rapidly
over a wide area. "Some Mollusca," says Professor E. Forbes, "migrate
in their larva state, for all of them undergo a metamorphosis either in the
egg or out of the egg. The gasteropoda commence life under the form
of a small spiral shell, and an animal furnished with ciliated wings, or
lobes, like a pteropod, by means of which it can swim freely, and in this
form can migrate with ease through the sea."<a name="FNanchor_920" id="FNanchor_920"></a><a href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_652" id="Page_652">652</a></span>
We are accustomed to associate in our minds the idea of the greatest
locomotive powers with the most mature and perfect state of each
species of invertebrate animal, especially when they undergo a series of
transformations; but in all the Mollusca the reverse is true. The young
fry of the cockle, for example (<i>Cardium</i>), possess, when young or in the
larva state, an apparatus which enables them both to swim and to be
carried along easily by a marine current. (See <a href="#f99">fig. 99</a>.)</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 99.</span><a name="f99" id="f99"></a><img src="images/f99.jpg" width="450" height="198" alt="Tne young fry of a cockle (Cardium pygmaeum,) from Loven's Kongl. Vetenskaps. Akadem.

<p class="center2">Tne young fry of a cockle (Cardium pygm&aelig;um,) from Loven's Kongl. Vetenskaps. Akadem.

<i>d</i>, The rudimentary shell.</p>

<p>These small bodies here represented, which bear a considerable
resemblance to the fry of the univalve, or gasteropodous shells above
mentioned, are so minute at first as to be just visible to the naked eye.
They begin to move about from the moment they are hatched, by means
of the long cilia, <i>a</i>, <i>a</i>, placed on the edges of the locomotive disk or
velum. This disk shrinks up as they increase in size, and gradually
disappears, no trace of it being visible in the perfect animal.</p>

<p>Some species of shell-bearing Mollusca lay their eggs in a sponge-like
nidus, wherein the young remain enveloped for a time after their birth;
and this buoyant substance floats far and wide as readily as sea-weed.
The young of other viviparous tribes are often borne along entangled in
sea-weed. Sometimes they are so light, that, like grains of sand, they
can be easily moved by currents. Balani and Serpul&aelig; are sometimes
found adhering to floating cocoa-nuts, and even to fragments of pumice.
In rivers and lakes, on the other hand, aquatic univalves usually attach
their eggs to leaves and sticks which have fallen into the water, and
which are liable to be swept away during floods, from tributaries to the
main streams, and from thence to all parts of the same basins. Particular
species may thus migrate during one season from the head waters
of the Mississippi, or any other great river, to countries bordering the
sea, at the distance of many thousand miles.</p>

<p>An illustration of the mode of attachment of these eggs will be seen
in the annexed cut. (Fig. 100.)</p>

<p>The habit of some Testacea to adhere to floating wood is proved by
their fixing themselves to the bottoms of ships. By this mode of conveyance
<i>Mytilus polymorphus</i>, previously known only in the Danube and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_653" id="Page_653">653</a></span>
Wolga, may have been brought to the Commercial Docks in the Thames,
and to Hamburgh, where the species is now domiciled. But Mr. Gray
suggests that as the animal is known to have the faculty of living for a
very long time out of water, it is more probable that it was brought in
Russian timber, than borne uninjured through the salt water at the
bottom of a vessel.<a name="FNanchor_921" id="FNanchor_921"></a><a href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a></p>

<p>A lobster (<i>Astacus marinus</i>) was lately taken alive covered with living
mussels (<i>Mytilus edulis</i>)<a name="FNanchor_922" id="FNanchor_922"></a><a href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a>; and a large female crab (<i>Cancer pagurus</i>),
covered with oysters, and bearing also <i>Anomia ephippium</i>, and Actini&aelig;,
was taken in April, 1832, off the English coast. The oysters, seven in number,
include individuals of six years' growth, and the two largest are four
inches long and three inches and a half broad. Both the crab and
the oysters were seen alive by Mr. Robert Brown.<a name="FNanchor_923" id="FNanchor_923"></a><a href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 100.</span><a name="f100" id="f100"></a><img src="images/f100.jpg" width="550" height="369" alt="Eggs of Freshwater mollusks." title="" />

<p>From this example we learn the manner in which oysters may be
diffused over every part of the sea where the crab wanders; and if they
are at length carried to a spot where there is nothing but fine mud, the
foundation of a new oyster-bank may be laid on the death of the crab.
In this instance the oysters survived the crab many days, and were
killed at last only by long exposure to the air.</p>

<h5><i>Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Zoophytes.</i></h5>

<p>Zoophytes are very imperfectly known; but there can be little doubt
that each maritime region possesses species peculiar to itself. The
Madrepores, or lamelliferous Polyparia, are found in their fullest development
only in the tropical seas of Polynesia and the East and West
Indies; and this family is represented only by a few species in our seas.
The zoophytes of the Mediterranean, according to Ehrenberg, differ
almost entirely from those of the Red Sea, although only seventy miles
distant. Out of 120 species of Anthozoa, only two are common to both
seas.<a name="FNanchor_924" id="FNanchor_924"></a><a href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> P&eacute;ron and Lesueur, after studying the Holothuri&aelig;, Medus&aelig;,
and other congeners of delicate and changeable forms, came to the conclusion
that each kind has its place of residence determined by the
temperature necessary to support its existence. Thus, for example,
they found the abode of <i>Pyrosoma Atlantica</i> to be confined to one
particular region of the Atlantic Ocean.<a name="FNanchor_925" id="FNanchor_925"></a><a href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a></p>

<p>Let us now inquire how the transportation of zoophytes from one
part of the globe to another is effected. Many of them, as in the
families Flustra and Sertularia, attach themselves to sea-weed, and are
occasionally drifted along with it. Many fix themselves to the shells of
Mollusca, and are thus borne along by them to short distances. Others,
like some species of sea-pens, float about in the ocean, and are usually
believed to possess powers of spontaneous motion. But the most frequent
mode of transportation consists in the buoyancy of their eggs,
or certain small vesicles, which are detached, and are capable of becoming
the foundation of a new colony. These gems, as they are called,
have, in many instances, a locomotive power of their own, by which
they proceed in a determinate direction for several days after separation
from the parent. They are propelled by means of numerous short
threads or <i>cili&aelig;</i>, which are in constant and rapid vibration; and, when
thus supported in the water, they may be borne along by currents to a
great distance.</p>

<p>That some zoophytes adhere to floating bodies, is proved by their
being found attached to the bottoms of ships, like certain Testacea
before alluded to.</p>

<h5><i>Geographical Distribution and Migrations of Insects.</i></h5>

<p>Before I conclude this sketch of the manner in which the habitable
parts of the earth are shared out among particular assemblages of
organic beings, I must offer a few remarks on insects, which, by their
numbers and the variety of their powers and instincts, exert a prodigious
influence in the economy of animate nature. As a large portion
of these minute creatures are strictly dependent for their subsistence on
certain species of vegetables, the entomological provinces must coincide
in considerable degree with the botanical.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_655" id="Page_655">655</a></span>
All the insects, says Latreille, brought from the eastern parts of Asia
and China, whatever be their latitude and temperature, are distinct from
those of Europe and of Africa. The insects of the United States,
although often approaching very close to our own, are, with very few
exceptions, specifically distinguishable by some characters. In South
America, the equinoctial lands of New Granada and Peru on the one
side, and of Guiana on the other, contain for the most part distinct
groups; the Andes forming the division, and interposing a narrow
line of severe cold between climates otherwise very similar.<a name="FNanchor_926" id="FNanchor_926"></a><a href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a></p>

<p><i>Migratory instincts.</i>&mdash;Nearly all the insects of the United States
and Canada, differ specifically from the European; while those of Greenland
appear to be in a great measure identical with our own. Some
insects are very local; while a few, on the contrary, are common to
remote countries, between which the torrid zone and the ocean intervene.
Thus our painted lady butterfly (<i>Vanessa cardui</i>) re-appears at
the Cape of Good Hope and in New Holland and Japan with scarcely
a varying streak.<a name="FNanchor_927" id="FNanchor_927"></a><a href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a> The same species is said to be one of the few
insects which are universally dispersed over the earth, being found
in Europe, Asia, Africa, and America; and its wide range is the more
interesting, because it seems explained by its migratory instinct,
seconded, no doubt, by a capacity, enjoyed by few species, of enduring
a great diversity of temperature.</p>

<p>A vast swarm of this species, forming a column from ten to fifteen
feet broad, was, a few years since, observed in the Canton de Vaud;
they traversed the country with great rapidity from north to south, all
flying onwards in regular order, close together, and not turning from
their course on the approach of other objects. Professor Bonelli, of
Turin, observed, in March of the same year, a similar swarm of the
same species, also directing their flight from north to south, in Piedmont,
in such immense numbers that at night the flowers were literally
covered with them. They had been traced from Coni, Raconi, Susa, &amp;c.
A similar flight at the end of the last century is recorded by M. Louch in
the Memoirs of the Academy of Turin. The fact is the more worthy of
notice, because the caterpillars of this butterfly are not gregarious, but
solitary from the moment that they are hatched; and this instinct remains
dormant, while generation after generation passes away, till it suddenly
displays itself in full energy when their numbers happen to be in excess.</p>

<p>Not only peculiar species, but certain types, distinguish particular
countries; and there are groups, observes Kirby, which represent each
other in distant regions, whether in their form, their functions, or in
both. Thus the honey and wax of Europe, Asia, and Africa, are in each
case prepared by bees congenerous with our common hive-bee (<i>Apis</i>,
Latr.); while, in America, this genus is nowhere indigenous, but is
replaced by Melipona, Trigona, and Euglossa; and in New Holland by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_656" id="Page_656">656</a></span>
a still different but undescribed type.<a name="FNanchor_928" id="FNanchor_928"></a><a href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a> The European bee (<i>Apis mellifica</i>),
although not a native of the new world, is now established both
in North and South America. It was introduced into the United States
by some of the early settlers, and has since overspread the vast forests
of the interior, building hives in the decayed trunks of trees. "The
Indians," says Irving, "consider them as the harbinger of the white
man, as the buffalo is of the red man, and say that in proportion as the
bee advances the Indian and the buffalo retire. It is said," continues
the same writer, "that the wild bee is seldom to be met with at any
great distance from the frontier, and that they have always been the
heralds of civilization, preceding it as it advanced from the Atlantic
borders. Some of the ancient settlers of the west even pretend to give
the very year when the honey-bee first crossed the Mississippi."<a name="FNanchor_929" id="FNanchor_929"></a><a href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a> The
same species is now also naturalized in Van Diemen's Land and New
Zealand.</p>

<p>As almost all insects are winged, they can readily spread themselves
wherever their progress is not opposed by uncongenial climates, or by
seas, mountains, and other physical impediments; and these barriers
they can sometimes surmount by abandoning themselves to violent
winds, which, as I before stated, when speaking of the dispersion of
seeds (p. 618.), may in a few hours carry them to very considerable
distances. On the Andes some sphinxes and flies have been observed
by Humboldt, at the height of 19,180 feet above the sea, and which
appeared to him to have been involuntarily carried into these regions
by ascending currents of air.<a name="FNanchor_930" id="FNanchor_930"></a><a href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a></p>

<p>White mentions a remarkable shower of aphides which seem to have
emigrated, with an east wind, from the great hop plantations of Kent
and Sussex, and blackened the shrubs and vegetables where they alighted
at Selbourne, spreading at the same time in great clouds all along the
vale from Farnham to Alton. These aphides are sometimes accompanied
by vast numbers of the common lady-bird (<i>Coccinella septempunctata</i>),
which feed upon them.<a name="FNanchor_931" id="FNanchor_931"></a><a href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a></p>

<p>It is remarkable, says Kirby, that many of the insects which are
occasionally observed to emigrate, as, for instance, the Libellul&aelig;, Coccinell&aelig;,
Carabi, Cicad&aelig;, &amp;c. are not usually social insects; but seem to
congregate, like swallows, merely for the purpose of emigration.<a name="FNanchor_932" id="FNanchor_932"></a><a href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a>
Here, therefore, we have an example of an instinct developing itself on
certain rare emergencies, causing unsocial species to become gregarious
and to venture sometimes even to cross the ocean.</p>

<p>The armies of locusts which darken the air in Africa, and traverse
the globe from Turkey to our southern counties in England, are well
known to all. When the western gales sweep over the Pampas they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_657" id="Page_657">657</a></span>
bear along with them myriads of insects of various kinds. As a proof
of the manner in which species may be thus diffused, I may mention
that when the Creole frigate was lying in the outer roads off Buenos
Ayres, in 1819, at the distance of six miles from the land, her decks and
rigging were suddenly covered by thousands of flies and grains of sand.
The sides of the vessel had just received a fresh coat of paint, to which
the insects adhered in such numbers as to spot and disfigure the vessel,
and to render it necessary partially to renew the paint.<a name="FNanchor_933" id="FNanchor_933"></a><a href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a> Captain W.
H. Smyth was obliged to repaint his vessel, the Adventure, in the Mediterranean,
from the same cause. He was on his way from Malta to
Tripoli, when a southern wind blowing from the coast of Africa, then
one hundred miles distant, drove such myriads of flies upon the fresh
paint, that not the smallest point was left unoccupied by insects.</p>

<p>To the southward of the river Plate, off Cape St. Antonio, and at the
distance of fifty miles from land, several large dragon-flies alighted on the
Adventure frigate, during Captain King's late expedition to the Straits of
Magellan. If the wind abates when insects are thus crossing the sea, the
most delicate species are not necessarily drowned; for many can repose
without sinking on the water. The slender long-legged tipul&aelig; have been
seen standing on the surface of the sea, when driven out far from our
coast, and took wing immediately on being approached.<a name="FNanchor_934" id="FNanchor_934"></a><a href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a> Exotic beetles
are sometimes thrown on our shore, which revive after having been long
drenched in salt water; and the periodical appearance of some conspicuous
butterflies amongst us, after being unseen some for five others for fifty
years, has been ascribed, not without probability, to the agency of the
winds.</p>

<p>Inundations of rivers, observes Kirby, if they happen at any season except
in the depths of winter, always carry down a number of insects,
floating on the surface of bits of stick, weeds, &amp;c.; so that when the waters
subside, the entomologist may generally reap a plentiful harvest. In the
dissemination, moreover, of these minute beings, as in that of plants, the
larger animals play their part. Insects are, in numberless instances, borne
along in the coats of animals, or the feathers of birds; and the eggs of
some species are capable, like seeds, of resisting the digestive powers of
the stomach, and after they are swallowed with herbage, may be ejected
again unharmed in the dung.</p>

<h5><i>Geographical Distribution and Diffusion of Man.</i></h5>

<p>I have reserved for the last some observations on the range and diffusion
of the human species over the earth, and the influence of man in
spreading other animals and plants, especially the terrestrial.</p>

<p>Many naturalists have amused themselves in speculating on the probable
birth-place of mankind, the point from which, if we assume the whole
human race to have descended from a single pair, the tide of emigration
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_658" id="Page_658">658</a></span>
must originally have proceeded. It has been always a favorite conjecture,
that this birth-place was situated within or near the tropics, where
perpetual summer reigns, and where fruits, herbs, and roots are plentifully
supplied throughout the year. The climate of these regions, it has been
said, is suited to a being born without any covering, and who had not yet
acquired the arts of building habitations or providing clothes.</p>

<p><i>Progress of Human Population.</i>&mdash;"The hunter state," it has been argued,
"which Montesquieu placed the first, was probably only the second
stage to which mankind arrived; since so many arts must have been invented
to catch a salmon, or a deer, that society could no longer have
been in its infancy when they came into use."<a name="FNanchor_935" id="FNanchor_935"></a><a href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> When regions where the
spontaneous fruits of the earth abound became overpeopled, men would
naturally diffuse themselves over the neighboring parts of the temperate
zone; but a considerable time would probably elapse before this event took
place; and it is possible, as a writer before cited observes, that in the
interval before the multiplication of their numbers and their increasing
wants had compelled them to emigrate, some arts to take animals were
invented, but far inferior to what we see practised at this day among
savages. As their habitations gradually advanced into the temperate
zone, the new difficulties they had to encounter would call forth by
degrees the spirit of invention, and the probability of such inventions
always rises with the number of people involved in the same necessity.<a name="FNanchor_936" id="FNanchor_936"></a><a href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a></p>

<p>A distinguished modern writer, who coincides for the most part in the
views above mentioned, has introduced one of the persons in his second
dialogue, as objecting to the theory of the human race having gradually
advanced from a savage to a civilized state, on the ground that "the first
man must have inevitably been destroyed by the elements or devoured by
savage beasts, so infinitely his superiors in physical force."<a name="FNanchor_937" id="FNanchor_937"></a><a href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a> He then
contends against the difficulty here started by various arguments, all of
which were, perhaps, superfluous; for if a philosopher is pleased to indulge
in conjectures on this subject, why should he not assign, as the original
seat of man, some one of those large islands within the tropics, which are
as free from large beasts of prey as Van Diemen's Land or Australia?
Here man may have remained for a period, peculiar to a single island,
just as some of the large anthropomorphous species are now limited to
one island within the tropics. In such a situation, the new-born race
might have lived in security, though far more helpless than the New Holland
savages, and might have found abundance of vegetable food. Colonies
may afterwards have been sent forth from this mother country,
and then the peopling of the earth may have proceeded according to the
hypothesis before alluded to.</p>

<p>To form a probable conjecture respecting the country from whence the
early civilization of India was derived, has been found almost as difficult
as to determine the original birth-place of the human race. That the
dawn of oriental civilization did not arise within the limits of the tropics,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_659" id="Page_659">659</a></span>
is the conclusion to which Baron William von Humboldt has come after
much patient research into "the diversities of the structure of language
and their influence on the mental development of the human race." According
to him the ancient Zend country from whence the spread of
knowledge and the arts has been traced in a south-easterly direction, lay
to the north-west of the upper Indus.<a name="FNanchor_938" id="FNanchor_938"></a><a href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a></p>

<p>As to the time of the first appearance of man upon the earth, if we
are to judge from the discordance of opinion amongst celebrated chronologers,
not even a rude approximation has yet been made towards
determining a point of so much interest. The problem seems hitherto to
have baffled the curiosity of the antiquary, if possible, more completely
than the fixing on a geographical site for the original habitation of the
ancestors of the human race. The Chevalier Bunsen, in his elaborate
and philosophical work on Ancient Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_939" id="FNanchor_939"></a><a href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a> has satisfied not a few of the
learned, by an appeal to monumental inscriptions still extant, that the
successive dynasties of kings may be traced back without a break, to
Menes, and that the date of his reign would correspond with the year
3640 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span> He supposes at the same time, what is most reasonable, that
the Egyptian people must have existed for a long period (probably at
least for five centuries), in their earlier and less settled state, before they
reached the point of civilization at which Menes consolidated them into
a great and united empire. This would carry us back to upwards of
4000 years <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, or to an epoch coincident with that commonly set down
for the creation of the world in accordance with computations founded on
the combined ages of the successive antediluvian patriarchs. It follows
that the same epoch of Menes is anterior by a great many centuries to
the most ancient of the dates usually fixed upon for the Mosaic deluge.
The fact that no record or tradition of any great and overwhelming flood
has been detected in the mythology, or monumental annals of the Egyptians,
will suggest many reflections to a geologist who has weighed well
the evidence we possess of a variety of partial deluges which have happened
in districts not free like Egypt, for the last 3000 years, from earthquakes
and other causes of great aqueous catastrophes. The tales and
legends of calamitous floods preserved in Greece, Asia Minor, the southern
shores of the Baltic, China, Peru, and Chili, have, as we have seen, been
all of them handed down to us by the inhabitants of regions in which
the operation of natural causes in modern times, and the recurrence of a
succession of disastrous floods, afford us data for interpreting the meaning
of the obscure traditions of an illiterate age.<a name="FNanchor_940" id="FNanchor_940"></a><a href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a></p>

<p>In his learned treatise on ancient chronology, Dr. Hales has selected,
from a much greater number, a list of no less than 120 authors, all of
whom give a different period for the epoch of the creation of the world,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_660" id="Page_660">660</a></span>
the extreme range of difference between them amounting to no less than
3268 years. It appears that even amongst authorities, who in England
are generally regarded, as orthodox, there is a variance, not of years or
of one or two centuries, but of upwards of a millennium, according as they
have preferred to follow the Hebrew, or the Samaritan, or the Greek versions
of the Mosaic writings. Can we then wonder that they who decipher
the monuments of Egypt, or the geologist who interprets the
earth's autobiography, should arrive at views respecting the date of an
ancient empire, or the age of our planet, irreconcilable with every one
of these numerous and conflicting chronologies? The want of agreement
amongst the learned in regard to the probable date of the deluge
of Noah is a source of far greater perplexity and confusion than our extreme
uncertainty as to the epoch of the creation,&mdash;the deluge being a
comparatively modern event, from which the repeopling of the earth and
the history of the present races of mankind is made to begin.</p>

<p>Naturalists have long felt that to render probable the received opinion
that all the leading varieties of the human family have originally sprung
from a single pair, (a doctrine against which there appears to me to be
no sound objection,) a much greater lapse of time is required for the
slow and gradual formation of races, (such as the Caucasian, Mongolian,
and Negro,) than is embraced in any of the popular systems of chronology.
The existence of two of those marked varieties above mentioned
can be traced back 3000 years before the present time, or to the painting
of pictures, preserved in the tombs or on the walls of buried temples in
Egypt. In these we behold the Negro and Caucasian physiognomies
portrayed as faithfully and in as strong contrast as if the likenesses of those
races had been taken yesterday. When we consider therefore the extreme
slowness of the changes, which climate and other modifying
causes have produced in modern times, we must allow for a vast series of
antecedent ages, in the course of which the long-continued influence of similar
external circumstances gave rise to peculiarities, probably increased in
many successive generations, until they were fixed by hereditary transmission.
The characteristic forms and features thus acquired by certain
tribes, may have been afterwards diffused by migration from a few centres
over wide continental spaces. The theory, therefore, that all the
races of man have come from one common stock receives support from
every investigation which forces us to expand our ideas of the duration
of past time, or which multiplies the number of years that have passed
away since the origin of man. Hitherto, geology has neither enlarged
nor circumscribed the "human period;" but simply proved that in the
history of animated nature it is comparatively modern, or the last of a
long series of antecedent epochs, in each of which the earth has been
successively peopled by distinct species of animals and plants.</p>

<p>In an early stage of society the necessity of hunting acts as a principle
of repulsion, causing men to spread with the greatest rapidity over a
country, until the whole is covered with scattered settlements. It has
been calculated that eight hundred acres of hunting-ground produce only
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_661" id="Page_661">661</a></span>
as much food as half an acre of arable land. When the game has been
in a great measure exhausted, and a state of pasturage succeeds, the
several hunter tribes, being already scattered, may multiply in a short
time into the greatest number which the pastoral state is capable of sustaining.
The necessity, says Brand, thus imposed upon the two savage
states, of dispersing themselves far and wide over the country, affords a
reason why, at a very early period, the worst parts of the earth may have
become inhabited.</p>

<p>But this reason, it may be said, is only applicable in as far as regards
the peopling of a continuous continent; whereas the smallest islands,
however remote from continents, have almost always been found inhabited
by man. St. Helena, it is true, afforded an exception; for when
that island was discovered in 1501, it was only inhabited by sea-fowl,
and occasionally by seals and turtles, and was covered with a forest of
trees and shrubs, all of species peculiar to it, with one or two exceptions,
and which seem to have been expressly created for this remote and
insulated spot.<a name="FNanchor_941" id="FNanchor_941"></a><a href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">941</a></p>

<p>The islands also of Mauritius, Bourbon, Pitcairns, and Juan Fernandez,
and those of the Galapagos archipelago, one of which is seventy
miles long, were inhabited when first discovered, and, what is more
remarkable than all, the Falkland Islands, which together are 120 miles
in length by 60 in breadth, and abounding in food fit for the support
of man.</p>

<p><i>Drifting of canoes to vast distances.</i>&mdash;But very few of the numerous
coral islets and volcanoes of the vast Pacific, capable of sustaining a
few families of men, have been found untenanted; and we have, therefore,
to inquire whence and by what means, if all the members of the
great human family have had one common source, could those savages
have migrated. Cook, Forster, and others, have remarked that parties
of savages in their canoes must have often lost their way, and must
have been driven on distant shores, where they were forced to remain,
deprived both of the means and of the requisite intelligence for returning
to their own country. Thus Captain Cook found on the island of
Wateoo three inhabitants of Otaheite, who had been drifted thither in
a canoe, although the distance between the two isles is 550 miles. In
1696, two canoes, containing thirty persons, who had left Ancorso, were
thrown by contrary winds and storms on the island of Samar, one of
the Philippines, at a distance of 800 miles. In 1721, two canoes, one
of which contained twenty-four, and the other six persons, men, women,
and children, were drifted from an island called Farroilep to the island
of Guaham, one of the Marians, a distance of 200 miles.<a name="FNanchor_942" id="FNanchor_942"></a><a href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a></p>

<p>Kotzebue, when investigating the Coral Isles of Radack, at the eastern
extremity of the Caroline Isles, became acquainted with a person of
the name of Kadu, who was a native of Ulea, an isle 1500 miles distant,
from which he had been drifted with a party. Kadu and three of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_662" id="Page_662">662</a></span>
countrymen one day left Ulea in a sailing boat, when a violent storm
arose, and drove them out of their course: they drifted about the open
sea for eight months, according to their reckoning by the moon, making
a knot on a cord at every new moon. Being expert fishermen, they
subsisted entirely on the produce of the sea; and when the rain fell, laid
in as much fresh water as they had vessels to contain it. "Kadu,"
says Kotzebue, "who was the best diver, frequently went down to the
bottom of the sea, where it is well known that the water is not so salt,
with a cocoa-nut shell, with only a small opening."<a name="FNanchor_943" id="FNanchor_943"></a><a href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a> When these
unfortunate men reached the isles of Radack, every hope and almost
every feeling had died within them; their sail had long been destroyed,
their canoe had long been the sport of winds and waves, and they
were picked up by the inhabitants of Aur in a state of insensibility;
but by the hospitable care of those islanders they soon recovered, and
were restored to perfect health.<a name="FNanchor_944" id="FNanchor_944"></a><a href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a></p>

<p>Captain Beechey, in his voyage to the Pacific, fell in with some natives
of the Coral Islands, who had in a similar manner been carried to a
great distance from their native country. They had embarked, to the
number of 150 souls, in three double canoes, from Anaa, or Chain
Island, situated about three hundred miles to the eastward of Otaheite.
They were overtaken by the monsoon, which dispersed the canoes; and
after driving them about the ocean, left them becalmed, so that a great
number of persons perished. Two of the canoes were never heard of;
but the other was drifted from one uninhabited island to another, at
each of which the voyagers obtained a few provisions; and at length,
after having wandered for a distance of 600 miles, they were found and
carried to their home in the Blossom.<a name="FNanchor_945" id="FNanchor_945"></a><a href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">945</a></p>

<p>Mr. Crawfurd informs me that there are several well-authenticated
accounts of canoes having been drifted from Sumatra to Madagascar,
and by such causes a portion of the Malayan language, with some
useful plants, have been transferred to that island, which is principally
peopled by negroes.</p>

<p>The space traversed in some of these instances was so great, that
similar accidents might suffice to transport canoes from various parts of
Africa to the shores of South America, or from Spain to the Azores,
and thence to North America; so that man, even in a rude state of
society, is liable to be scattered involuntarily by the winds and waves
over the globe, in a manner singularly analogous to that in which many
plants and animals are diffused. We ought not, then, to wonder, that
during the ages required for some tribes of the human race to attain
that advanced stage of civilization which empowers the navigator to
cross the ocean in all directions with security, the whole earth should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_663" id="Page_663">663</a></span>
have become the abode of rude tribes of hunters and fishers. Were
the whole of mankind now cut off, with the exception of one family,
inhabiting the old or new continent, or Australia, or even some coral
islet of the Pacific, we might expect their descendants, though they
should never become more enlightened than the South Sea Islanders or
the Esquimaux, to spread in the course of ages over the whole earth,
diffused partly by the tendency of population to increase, in a limited
district, beyond the means of subsistence, and partly by the accidental
drifting of canoes by tides and currents to distant shores.</p>

<h5><i>Involuntary Influence of Man in diffusing Animals and Plants.</i></h5>

<p>Many of the general remarks which have been made respecting the
influence of man in spreading or in checking the diffusion of plants
apply equally to his relations with the animal kingdom. On a future
occasion I shall be led to speak of the instrumentality of our species in
naturalizing useful animals and plants in new regions, when explaining
my views of the effects which the spreading and increase of certain
species exert in the extirpation of others. At present I shall confine
myself to a few remarks on the involuntary aid which man lends to the
dissemination of species.</p>

<p>In the mammiferous class our influence is chiefly displayed in increasing
the number of quadrupeds which are serviceable to us, and in
exterminating or reducing the number of those which are noxious.</p>

<p>Sometimes, however, we unintentionally promote the multiplication of
inimical species, as when we introduced the rat, which was not indigenous
in the new world, into all parts of America. They have been conveyed
over in ships, and now infest a great multitude of islands and parts of
that continent. In like manner the Norway rat (<i>Mus decumanus</i>)
has been imported into England, where it plunders our property in ships
and houses.</p>

<p>Among birds, the house sparrow may be cited as a species known to
have extended its range with the tillage of the soil. During the last
century it has spread gradually over Asiatic Russia towards the north
and east, always following the progress of cultivation. It made its first
appearance on the Irtisch in Tobolsk, soon after the Russians had
ploughed the land. It came in 1735 up the Obi to Beresow, and four
years after to Naryn, about fifteen degrees of longitude farther east. In
1710, it had been seen in the higher parts of the coast of the Lena, in the
government of Irkutzk. In all these places it is now common, but is not
yet found in the uncultivated regions of Kamtschatka.<a name="FNanchor_946" id="FNanchor_946"></a><a href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">946</a></p>

<p>The great viper (<i>Fer de lance</i>), a species no less venomous than the
rattlesnake, which now ravages Martinique and St. Lucia, was accidentally
introduced by man, and exists in no other part of the West Indies.</p>

<p>Many parasitic insects which attack our persons, and some of which
are supposed to be peculiar to our species, have been carried into all parts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_664" id="Page_664">664</a></span>
of the earth, and have as high a claim as man to a <i>universal</i> geographical
distribution.</p>

<p>A great variety of insects have been transported in ships from one
country to another, especially in warmer latitudes. The European house-fly
has been introduced in this way into all the South Sea Islands.
Notwithstanding the coldness of our climate in England we have been
unable to prevent the cockroach (<i>Blatta orientalis</i>) from entering and
diffusing itself in our ovens and kneading troughs, and availing itself
of the artificial warmth which we afford. It is well known also, that
beetles, and many other kinds of ligniperdous insects, have been introduced
into Great Britain in timber; especially several North American
species. "The commercial relations," says Malte-Brun<a name="FNanchor_947" id="FNanchor_947"></a><a href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a>, "between France
and India have transported from the latter country the aphis, which
destroys the apple tree, and two sorts of Neuroptera, the <i>Lucifuga</i> and
<i>Flavicola</i>, mostly confined to Provence and the neighbourhood of Bourdeaux,
where they devour the timber in the houses and naval arsenals."</p>

<p>Among mollusks we may mention the <i>Teredo navalis</i>, which is a
native of equatorial seas, but which, by adhering to the bottom of ships,
was transported to Holland, where it has been most destructive to vessels
and piles. The same species has also become naturalized in England,
and other countries enjoying an extensive commerce. <i>Bulimus undatus</i>,
a land species of considerable size, native of Jamaica and other West Indian
islands, has been imported, adhering to tropical timber, into Liverpool;
and, as I learn from Mr. Broderip, is now naturalized in the woods
near that town.</p>

<p>In all these and innumerable other instances we may regard the involuntary
agency of man as strictly analogous to that of the inferior animals.
Like them, we unconsciously contribute to extend or limit the
geographical range and numbers of certain species, in obedience to general
rules in the economy of nature, which are for the most part beyond
our control.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XL.</h4>

<h6>THEORIES RESPECTING THE ORIGINAL INTRODUCTION OF SPECIES.</h6>

<p><i>Theory of Linn&aelig;us.</i>&mdash;It would be superfluous to examine the various
attempts which were made to explain the phenomena of the distribution
of species alluded to in the preceding chapters, in the infancy
of the sciences of botany, zoology, and physical geography. The
theories or rather conjectures then indulged now stand refuted by a
simple statement of facts; and if Linn&aelig;us were living he would be the
first to renounce the notions which he promulgated. For he imagined
the habitable world to have been for a certain time limited to one small
tract, the only portion of the earth's surface that was as yet laid bare
by the subsidence of the prim&aelig;val ocean. In this fertile spot he supposed
the originals of all the species of plants which exist on this globe
to have been congregated together with the first ancestors of all animals
and of the human race. "In qu&acirc; commod&egrave; habitaverint animalia
omnia, et vegetabilia l&aelig;t&egrave; germinaverint." In order to accommodate the
various habitudes of so many creatures, and to provide a diversity of
climate suited to their several natures, the tract in which the creation
took place was supposed to have been situated in some warm region of
the earth, but to have contained a lofty mountain range, on the heights
and in the declivities of which were to be found all temperatures and
every climate, from that of the torrid to that of the frozen zone.<a name="FNanchor_948" id="FNanchor_948"></a><a href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">948</a></p>

<p>That there never was a universal ocean since the planet was inhabited,
or, rather, since the oldest groups of strata yet known to contain organic
remains were formed, is proved by the presence of terrestrial plants or
by indications of shores in all the older formations; and if this conclusion
was not established, yet no geologist could deny that, since the
first small portion of the earth was laid dry, there have been many
entire changes in the species of plants and animals inhabiting the land.</p>

<p>But, without dwelling on the above and other refuted theories, let
us inquire whether some hypothesis cannot be substituted as simple as
that of Linn&aelig;us, to which the phenomena now ascertained in regard to
the distribution both of aquatic and terrestrial species may be referred.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_666" id="Page_666">666</a></span>
The following may, perhaps, be reconcileable with known facts:&mdash;Each
species may have had its origin in a single pair, or individual, where an
individual was sufficient, and species may have been created in succession
at such times and in such places as to enable them to multiply and endure
for an appointed period, and occupy an appointed space on the globe.</p>

<p>In order to explain this theory, let us suppose every living thing to
be destroyed in the western hemisphere, both on the land and in the
ocean, and permission to be given to man to people this great desert,
by transporting into it animals and plants from the eastern hemisphere,
a strict prohibition being enforced against introducing two original
stocks of the same species.</p>

<p>Now it is easy to show that the result of such a mode of colonizing
would correspond exactly, so far as regards the grouping of animals and
plants, with that now observed throughout the globe. In the first place,
it would be necessary for naturalists, before they imported species into
particular localities, to study attentively the climate and other physical
conditions of each spot. It would be no less requisite to introduce the
different species in succession, so that each plant and animal might
have time and opportunity to multiply before the species destined to
prey upon it was admitted. Many herbs and shrubs, for example, must
spread far and wide before the sheep, the deer, and the goat could be
allowed to enter, lest they should devour and annihilate the original
stocks of many plants, and then perish themselves for want of food.
The above-mentioned herbivorous animals in their turn must be permitted
to make considerable progress before the entrance of the first
pair of wolves or lions. Insects must be allowed to swarm before the
swallow could be permitted to skim through the air, and feast on
thousands at one repast.</p>

<p>It is evident that, however equally in this case our original stocks
were distributed over the whole surface of land and water, there would
nevertheless arise distinct botanical and zoological provinces, for there
are a great many natural barriers which oppose common obstacles to
the advance of a variety of species. Thus, for example, almost all the
animals and plants naturalized by us, towards the extremity of South
America, would be unable to spread beyond a certain limit, towards the
east, west, and south; because they would be stopped by the ocean,
and a few of them only would succeed in reaching the cooler latitudes
of the northern hemisphere, because they would be incapable of bearing
the heat of the tropics, through which they must pass. In the
course of ages, undoubtedly, exceptions would arise, and some species
might become common to the temperate and polar regions, or both
sides of the equator; for I have before shown that the powers of diffusion
conferred on some classes are very great. But we might confidently
predict that these exceptions would never become so numerous
as to invalidate the general rule.</p>

<p>Some of the plants and animals transplanted by us to the coast of
Chili and Peru would never be able to cross the Andes, so as to reach
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_667" id="Page_667">667</a></span>
the eastern plains; nor, for a similar reason, would those first established
in the Pampas, or the valleys of the Amazon and the Orinoco, ever
arrive at the shores of the Pacific.</p>

<p>In the ocean an analogous state of things would prevail; for there,
also, climate would exert a great influence in limiting the range of species,
and the land would stop the migrations of aquatic tribes as effectually
as the sea arrests the dispersion of the terrestrial. As certain birds, insects,
and the seeds of plants, can never cross the direction of prevailing
winds, so currents form natural barriers to the dissemination of many
oceanic races. A line of shoals may be as impassable to deep-water
species, as are the Alps and the Andes to plants and animals peculiar to
plains; while deep abysses may prove insuperable obstacles to the migrations
of the inhabitants of shallow waters.</p>

<p><i>Supposed centres, or foci, of creation.</i>&mdash;It is worthy of observation,
that one effect of the introduction of single pairs of each species must be
the confined range of certain groups in spots, which, like small islands,
or solitary inland lakes, have few means of interchanging their inhabitants
with adjoining regions. Now this congregating in a small space
of many peculiar species, would give an appearance of <i>centres</i> or <i>foci</i> of
creation, as they have been termed, as if they were favourite points
where the creative energy has been in greater action than in others, and
where the numbers of peculiar organic beings have consequently become
more considerable.</p>

<p>I do not mean to call in question the soundness of the inferences of
some botanists, as to the former existence of certain limited spots whence
species of plants have been propagated, radiating, as it were, in all directions
from a common centre. On the contrary, I conceive these phenomena
to be the necessary consequences of the plan of nature before suggested,
operating during the successive mutations of the surface, some of
which the geologist can prove to have taken place subsequently to the
period when many species now existing were created. In order to exemplify
how this arrangement of plants may have been produced, let us
imagine that, about three centuries before the discovery of St. Helena
(itself of submarine volcanic origin), a multitude of new islands had
been thrown up in the surrounding sea, and that these had each become
clothed with plants emigrating from St. Helena, in the same manner as
the wild plants of Campania have diffused themselves over Monte Nuovo.
Whenever the first botanist investigated the new archipelago, he would,
in all probability, find a different assemblage of plants in each of the
islands of recent formation; but in St. Helena itself, he would meet with
individuals of every species, belonging to all parts of the archipelago,
and some, in addition, peculiar to itself, viz., those which had not been
able to obtain a passage into any one of the surrounding new-formed
lands. In this case it might be truly said that the original island was
the primitive focus, or centre, of a certain type of vegetation; whereas,
in the surrounding islands, there would be a smaller number of species,
yet all belonging to the same group.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_668" id="Page_668">668</a></span>
But this peculiar distribution of plants would not warrant the conclusion
that, in the space occupied by St. Helena, there had been a greater
exertion of creative power than in the spaces of equal area occupied by
the new adjacent lands; because, within the period in which St. Helena
had acquired its peculiar vegetation, each of the spots supposed to be
subsequently converted into land may have been the birth-place of a great
number of <i>marine</i> animals and plants, which may have had time to
scatter themselves far and wide over the southern Atlantic.</p>

<p><i>Why distinct provinces not more blended.</i>&mdash;Perhaps it may be objected
to some parts of the foregoing train of reasoning, that during the
lapse of past ages, especially during many partial revolutions of the
globe of comparatively modern date, different zoological and botanical
provinces ought to have become more confounded and blended together&mdash;that
the distribution of species approaches too nearly to what might
have been expected, if animals and plants had been introduced into the
globe when its physical geography had already assumed the features
which it now wears; whereas we know that, in certain districts, considerable
geographical changes have taken place since species identical with
those now in being were created.</p>

<p><i>Brocchi's speculations on loss of species.</i>&mdash;These and many kindred
topics cannot be fully discussed until we have considered, not merely the
general laws which may regulate the first introduction of species, but
those which may limit their <i>duration</i> on the earth. Brocchi remarked,
when hazarding some interesting conjectures respecting "the loss of
species," that a modern naturalist had no small assurance, who declared
"that individuals alone were capable of destruction, and that species
were so perpetuated that nature could not annihilate them, so long as
the planet lasted, or at least that nothing less than the shock of a comet,
or some similar disaster, could put an end to their existence."<a name="FNanchor_949" id="FNanchor_949"></a><a href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> The
Italian geologist, on the contrary, had satisfied himself that many species
of Testacea, which formerly inhabited the Mediterranean, had become
extinct, although a great number of others, which had been the contemporaries
of those lost races, still survived. He came to the opinion that
about half the species which peopled the waters when the Subapennine
strata were deposited had gone out of existence; and in this inference he
does not appear to have been far wrong.</p>

<p>But, instead of seeking a solution of this problem; like some other
geologists of his time, in a violent and general catastrophe, Brocchi endeavoured
to imagine some regular and constant law by which species
might be made to disappear from the earth gradually and in succession.
The death, he suggested, of a species might depend, like that of individuals,
on certain peculiarities of constitution conferred upon them at
their birth; and as the longevity of the one depends on a certain force
of vitality, which, after a period, grows weaker and weaker, so the duration
of the other may be governed by the quantity of prolific power
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_669" id="Page_669">669</a></span>
bestowed upon the species which, after a season, may decline in energy,
so that the fecundity and multiplication of individuals may be gradually
lessened from century to century, "until that fatal term arrives when the
embryo, incapable of extending and developing itself, abandons, almost
at the instant of its formation, the slender principle of life by which it
was scarcely animated,&mdash;and so all dies with it."</p>

<p>Now we may coincide in opinion with the Italian naturalist, as to the
gradual extinction of species one after another, by the operation of regular
and constant causes, without admitting an inherent principle of deterioration
in their physiological attributes. We might concede, "that many
species are on the decline, and that the day is not far distant when they
will cease to exist;" yet deem it consistent with what we know of the
nature of organic beings, to believe that the last individuals of each species
retain their prolific powers in their full intensity.</p>

<p>Brocchi has himself speculated on the share which a change of climate
may have had in rendering the Mediterranean unfit for the habitation of
certain Testacea, which still continued to thrive in the Indian Ocean, and
of others which were now only represented by analogous forms within
the tropics. He must also have been aware that other extrinsic causes,
such as the progress of human population, or the increase of some one
of the inferior animals, might gradually lead to the extirpation of a particular
species, although its fecundity might remain to the last unimpaired.
If, therefore, amid the vicissitudes of the animate and inanimate world,
there are known causes capable of bringing about the decline and extirpation
of species, it became him thoroughly to investigate the full extent
to which these might operate, before he speculated on any cause of so
purely hypothetical a kind as "the diminution of the prolific virtue."</p>

<p>If it could have been shown that some wild plant had insensibly dwindled
away and died out, as sometimes happens to cultivated varieties propagated
by cuttings, even though climate, soil, and every other circumstance,
should continue identically the same&mdash;if any animal had perished
while the physical condition of the earth, and the number and force of
its foes, with every other extrinsic cause, remain unaltered, then might we
have some ground for suspecting that the infirmities of age creep on as
naturally on species as upon individuals. But, in the absence of such observations,
let us turn to another class of facts, and examine attentively
the circumstances which determine the <i>stations</i> of particular animals and
plants, and perhaps we shall discover, in the vicissitudes to which these
stations are exposed, a cause fully adequate to explain the phenomena
under consideration.</p>

<p><i>Stations of plants and animals.</i>&mdash;Stations comprehend all the circumstances,
whether relating to the animate or inanimate world, which
determine whether a given plant or animal can exist in a given place;
so that if it be shown that stations can become essentially modified by
the influence of known causes, it will follow that species, as well as individuals,
are mortal.</p>

<p>Every naturalist is familiar with the fact, that although in a particular
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_670" id="Page_670">670</a></span>
country, such as Great Britain, there may be more than three thousand
species of plants, ten thousand insects, and a great variety in each of the
other classes; yet there will not be more than a hundred, perhaps not
half that number, inhabiting any given locality. There may be no want
of space in the supposed tract: it may be a large mountain, or an extensive
moor, or a great river plain, containing room enough for individuals
of every species in our island; yet the spot will be occupied by a few to
the exclusion of many, and these few are enabled, throughout long periods,
to maintain their ground successfully against every intruder, notwithstanding
the facilities which species enjoy, by virtue of their power of diffusion,
of invading adjacent territories.</p>

<p>The principal causes which enable a certain assemblage of plants thus
to maintain their ground against all others depend, as is well known, on
the relations between the physiological nature of each species, and the
climate, exposure, soil, and other physical conditions of the locality. Some
plants live only on rocks, others in meadows, a third class in marshes.
Of the latter, some delight in a fresh-water morass,&mdash;others in salt marshes,
where their roots may copiously absorb saline particles. Some prefer an
alpine region in a warm latitude, where, during the heat of summer,
they are constantly irrigated by the cool waters of melting snows. To
others loose sand, so fatal to the generality of species, affords the most
proper station. The <i>Carex arenaria</i> and the <i>Elymus arenarius</i> acquire
their full vigor on a sandy dune, obtaining an ascendancy over the very
plants which in a stiff clay would immediately stifle them.</p>

<p>Where the soil of a district is of so peculiar a nature that it is extremely
favorable to certain species, and agrees ill with every other, the former
get exclusive possession of the ground, and, as in the case of heaths, live
in societies. In like manner the bog moss (<i>Sphagnum</i>) is fully developed
in peaty swamps, and becomes, like the heath, in the language of botanists,
a social plant. Such monopolies, however, are not common, for they
are checked by various causes. Not only are many species endowed with
equal powers to obtain and keep possession of similar stations, but each
plant, for reasons not fully explained by the physiologist, has the property
of rendering the soil where it has grown less fitted for the support of
other individuals of its own species, or even other species of the same
family. Yet the same spot, so far from being impoverished, is improved,
for plants of <i>another</i> family. Oaks, for example, render the soil more
fertile for the fir tribe, and firs prepare the soil for oaks. Every agriculturist
feels the force of this law of the organic world, and regulates accordingly
the rotation of his crops.</p>

<p><i>Equilibrium in the number of species, how preserved.</i>&mdash;"All the plants
of a given country," says De Candolle, in his usual spirited style, "are at
war one with another. The first which establish themselves by chance
in a particular spot tend, by the mere occupancy of space, to exclude
other species&mdash;the greater choke the smaller; the longest livers replace
those which last for a shorter period; the more prolific gradually make
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_671" id="Page_671">671</a></span>
themselves masters of the ground, which species multiplying more slowly
would otherwise fill."</p>

<p>In this continual strife it is not always the resources of the plant itself
which enable it to maintain or extend its ground. Its success depends,
in a great measure, on the number of its foes or allies among the animals
and plants inhabiting the same region. Thus, for example, a herb
which loves the shade may multiply, if some tree with spreading boughs
and dense foliage flourish in the neighborhood. Another, which, if unassisted,
would be overpowered by the rank growth of some hardy competitor,
is secure because its leaves are unpalatable to cattle; which, on
the other hand, annually crop down its antagonist, and rarely suffer it to
ripen its seed.</p>

<p>Oftentimes we see some herb which has flowered in the midst of a
thorny shrub, when all the other individuals of the same species, in the
open fields around, are eaten down, and cannot bring their seed to
maturity. In this case, the shrub has lent his armor of spines and
prickles to protect the defenceless herb against the mouths of the cattle,
and thus a few individuals which occupied, perhaps, the most unfavorable
station in regard to exposure, soil, and other circumstances, may,
nevertheless, by the aid of an ally, become the principal source whereby
the winds are supplied with seeds which perpetuate the species throughout
the surrounding tract. Thus, in the New Forest in Hampshire, the
young oaks which are not consumed by the deer, or uprooted by the
swine, are indebted to the holly for their escape.</p>

<p>In the above examples we see one plant shielding another from the
attacks of animals; but instances are, perhaps, still more numerous,
where some animal defends a plant against the enmity of some other
subject of the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>Scarcely any beast, observes a Swedish naturalist, will touch the
nettle, but fifty different kinds of insects are fed by it.<a name="FNanchor_950" id="FNanchor_950"></a><a href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a> Some of these
seize upon the root, others upon the stem; some eat the leaves, others
devour the seeds and flowers; but for this multitude of enemies, the
nettle (<i>Urtica dioica</i>), which is now found in all the four quarters of the
globe, would annihilate a great number of plants. Linn&aelig;us tells us, in
his "Tour in Scania," that goats were turned into an island which
abounded with the <i>Agrostis arundinacea</i>, where they perished by famine;
but horses which followed them grew fat on the same plant. The goat,
also, he says, thrives on the meadow-sweet and water-hemlock, plants
which are injurious to cattle.<a name="FNanchor_951" id="FNanchor_951"></a><a href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a></p>

<p><i>Agency of insects.</i>&mdash;Every plant, observes Wilcke, has its proper insect
allotted to it to curb its luxuriancy, and to prevent it from multiplying
to the exclusion of others. "Thus grass in meadows sometimes
flourishes so as to exclude all other plants; here the Phal&aelig;na graminis
(<i>Bombyx gram.</i>), with her numerous progeny, finds a well-spread table;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_672" id="Page_672">672</a></span>
they multiply in immense numbers, and the farmer, for some years,
laments the failure of his crop; but the grass being consumed, the
moths die with hunger, or remove to another place. Now the quantity
of grass being greatly diminished, the other plants, which were before
choked by it, spring up, and the ground becomes variegated with a multitude
of different species of flowers. Had not nature given a commission
to this minister for that purpose, the grass would destroy a great
number of species of vegetables, of which the equilibrium is now kept
up."<a name="FNanchor_952" id="FNanchor_952"></a><a href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a></p>

<p>In the above passage allusion is made to the ravages committed in
1740, and the two following years, in many provinces of Sweden, by a
most destructive insect. The same moth is said never to touch the foxtail
grass, so that it may be classed as a most active ally and benefactor
of that species, and as peculiarly instrumental in preserving it in its
present abundance.<a name="FNanchor_953" id="FNanchor_953"></a><a href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a> A discovery of Rolander, cited in the treatise of
Wilcke above mentioned, affords a good illustration of the checks and
counter-checks which nature has appointed to preserve the balance of
power among species. "The <i>Phal&aelig;na strobilella</i> has the fir cone
assigned to it to deposit its eggs upon; the young caterpillars coming
out of the shell consume the cone and superfluous seed; but, lest the
destruction should be too general, the <i>Ichneumon strobilell&aelig;</i> lays its eggs
in the caterpillar, inserting its long tail in the openings of the cone till it
touches the included insect, for its body is too large to enter. Thus it
fixes its minute egg upon the caterpillar, which being hatched, destroys
it."<a name="FNanchor_954" id="FNanchor_954"></a><a href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a></p>

<p>Entomologists enumerate many parallel cases where insects, appropriated
to certain plants, are kept down by other insects, and these again
by parasites expressly appointed to prey on them.<a name="FNanchor_955" id="FNanchor_955"></a><a href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a> Few perhaps are in
the habit of duly appreciating the extent to which insects are active in
preserving the balance of species among plants, and thus regulating indirectly
the relative numbers of many of the higher orders of terrestrial
animals.</p>

<p>The peculiarity of their agency consists in their power of suddenly
multiplying their numbers to a degree which could only be accomplished
in a considerable lapse of time in any of the larger animals, and then as
instantaneously relapsing, without the intervention of any violent disturbing
cause, into their former insignificance.</p>

<p>If, for the sake of employing, on different but rare occasions, a power
of many hundred horses, we were under the necessity of feeding all these
animals at great cost in the intervals when their services were not required,
we should greatly admire the invention of a machine, such as the
steam-engine, which was capable at any moment of exerting the same
degree of strength without any consumption of food during periods of
inaction. The same kind of admiration is strongly excited when we
contemplate the powers of insect life, in the creation of which the Author
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_673" id="Page_673">673</a></span>
of nature has been so prodigal. A scanty number of minute individuals,
to be detected only by careful research, are ready in a few days, weeks,
or months, to give birth to myriads, which may repress any degree of
monopoly in another species, or remove nuisances, such as dead carcases,
which might taint the air. But no sooner has the destroying commission
been executed than the gigantic power becomes dormant&mdash;each of
the mighty host soon reaches the term of its transient existence, and the
season arrives when the whole species passes naturally into the egg, and
thence into the larva and pupa state. In this defenceless condition it
may be destroyed either by the elements, or by the augmentation of
some of its numerous foes which may prey upon it in the early stages of
its transformation: or it often happens that in the following year the
season proves unfavorable to the hatching of the eggs or the development
of the pup&aelig;.</p>

<p>Thus the swarming myriads depart which may have covered the vegetation
like the aphides, or darkened the air like locusts. In almost every
season there are some species which in this manner put forth their
strength, and then, like Milton's spirits, which thronged the spacious
hall, "reduce to smallest forms their shapes immense"&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Now less than smallest dwarfs.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>A few examples will illustrate the mode in which this force operates.
It is well known that, among the countless species of the insect creation,
some feed on animal, others on vegetable matter; and upon considering
a catalogue of eight thousand British Insects and Arachnid&aelig;, Mr. Kirby
found that these two divisions were nearly a counterpoise to each other,
the carnivorous being somewhat preponderant. There are also distinct
species, some appointed to consume living, others dead or putrid animal
and vegetable substances. One female, of <i>Musca carnaria</i>, will give birth
to twenty thousand young; and the larv&aelig; of many flesh-flies devour so
much food in twenty-four hours, and grow so quickly, as to increase their
weight two hundred-fold! In five days after being hatched they arrive
at their full growth and size, so that there was ground, says Kirby, for the
assertion of Linn&aelig;us, that three flies of <i>M. vomitoria</i> could devour a dead
horse as quickly as a lion<a name="FNanchor_956" id="FNanchor_956"></a><a href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a>; and another Swedish naturalist remarks, that so
great are the powers of propagation of a single species even of the
smallest insects, that each can commit, when required, more ravages than
the elephant.<a name="FNanchor_957" id="FNanchor_957"></a><a href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a></p>

<p>Next to locusts, the aphides, perhaps, exert the greatest power over
the vegetable world, and, like them, are so sometimes so numerous as to
darken the air. The multiplication of these little creatures is without
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_674" id="Page_674">674</a></span>
parallel, and almost every plant has its peculiar species. Reaumur has
proved that in five generations one aphis may be the progenitor of
5,904,900,000 descendants; and it is supposed that in one year there
may be twenty generations.<a name="FNanchor_958" id="FNanchor_958"></a><a href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> Mr. Curtis observes that, as among caterpillars
we find some that are constantly and unalterably attached to one
or more particular species of plants, and others that feed indiscriminately
on most sorts of herbage, so it is precisely with the aphides: some are
particular, others more general feeders; and as they resemble other insects
in this respect, so they do also in being more abundant in some years
than in others.<a name="FNanchor_959" id="FNanchor_959"></a><a href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a> In 1793 they were the chief, and in 1798 the sole,
cause of the failure of the hops. In 1794, a season, almost unparalleled
for drought, the hop was perfectly free from them; while peas and beans,
especially the former, suffered very much from their depredations.</p>

<p>The ravages of the caterpillars of some of our smaller moths afford a
good illustration of the temporary increase of a species. The oak-trees
of a considerable wood have been stripped of their leaves as bare as in
winter by the caterpillars of a small green moth (<i>Tortrix viridana</i>),
which has been observed the year following not to abound.<a name="FNanchor_960" id="FNanchor_960"></a><a href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a> The silver
Y moth (<i>Plusia gamma</i>), although one of our common species, is not
dreaded by us for its devastations; but legions of their caterpillars have
at times created alarm in France, as in 1735. Reaumur observes that
the female moth lays about four hundred eggs; so that if twenty caterpillars
were distributed in a garden, and all lived through the winter and
became moths in the succeeding May, the eggs laid by these, if half of
them were female and all fertile, would in the next generation produce
800,000 caterpillars.<a name="FNanchor_961" id="FNanchor_961"></a><a href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> A modern writer, therefore, justly observes that,
did not Providence put causes in operation to keep them in due bounds,
the caterpillars of this moth alone, leaving out of consideration the two
thousand other British species, might soon destroy more than half of our
vegetation.<a name="FNanchor_962" id="FNanchor_962"></a><a href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a></p>

<p>In the latter part of the last century an ant most destructive to the
sugar-cane (<i>Formica saccharivora</i>), appeared in such infinite hosts in the
island of Granada, as to put a stop to the cultivation of that vegetable.
Their numbers were incredible. The plantations and roads were filled
with them; many domestic quadrupeds, together with rats, mice, and
reptiles, and even birds, perished in consequence of this plague. It was
not till 1780 that they were at length annihilated by torrents of rain,
which accompanied a dreadful hurricane.<a name="FNanchor_963" id="FNanchor_963"></a><a href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a></p>

<p><i>Devastations caused by locusts.</i>&mdash;We may conclude by mentioning
some instances of the devastations of locusts in various countries. Among
other parts of Africa, Cyrenaica has been at different periods infested by
myriads of these creatures, which have consumed nearly every green
thing. The effect of the havoc committed by them may be estimated
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_675" id="Page_675">675</a></span>
by the famine they occasioned. St. Augustin mentions a plague of this
kind in Africa, which destroyed no less than 800,000 men in the kingdom
of Massinissa alone, and many more upon the territories bordering
upon the sea. It is also related, that in the year 591 an infinite army
of locusts migrated from Africa into Italy; and, after grievously ravaging
the country, were cast into the sea, when there arose a pestilence from
their stench, which carried off nearly a million of men and beasts.</p>

<p>In the Venetian territory, also, in 1748, more than thirty thousand
persons are said to have perished in a famine occasioned by this scourge;
and other instances are recorded of their devastations in France, Spain,
Italy, Germany, &amp;c. In different parts of Russia also, Hungary, and
Poland, in Arabia and India, and other countries, their visitations have
been periodically experienced. Although they have a preference for
certain plants, yet, when these are consumed, they will attack almost all
the remainder. In the accounts of the invasion of locusts, the statements
which appear most marvellous relate to the prodigious mass of
matter which encumbers the sea wherever they are blown into it, and the
pestilence arising from its putrefaction. Their dead bodies are said to
have been, in some places, heaped one upon another, to the depth of four
feet, in Russia, Poland and Lithuania; and when, in Southern Africa,
they were driven into the sea, by a north-west wind, they formed, says
Barrow, along the shore, for fifty miles, a bank three or four feet high.<a name="FNanchor_964" id="FNanchor_964"></a><a href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a>
But when we consider that forests are stripped of their foliage, and the
earth of its green garment for thousands of square miles, it may well be
supposed that the volume of animal matter produced may equal that of
great herds of quadrupeds and flights of large birds suddenly precipitated
into the sea.</p>

<p>The occurrence of such events, at certain intervals, in hot countries,
like the severe winters and damp summers returning after a series of
years in the temperate zone, may affect the proportional numbers of
almost all classes of animals and plants, and probably prove fatal to the
existence of many which would otherwise thrive there; while, on the
contrary, the same occurrences can scarcely fail to be favorable to
certain species which, if deprived of such aid, might not maintain their
ground.</p>

<p>Although it may usually be remarked that the extraordinary increase
of some one species is immediately followed and checked by the multiplication
of another, yet this does not always happen; partly because
many species feed in common on the same kinds of food, and partly because
many kinds of food are often consumed indifferently by one and
the same species. In the former case, where a variety of different animals
have precisely the same taste, as, for example, when many insectivorous
birds and reptiles devour alike some particular fly or beetle, the
unusual numbers of these insects may cause only a slight and almost
imperceptible augmentation of each of these species of bird and reptile.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_676" id="Page_676">676</a></span>
In the other instances, where one animal preys on others of almost every
class, as for example, where our English buzzards devour not only small
quadrupeds, as rabbits and field-mice, but also birds, frogs, lizards, and
insects, the profusion of any one of these last may cause all such general
feeders to subsist more exclusively upon the species thus in excess, by
which means the balance may be restored.</p>

<p><i>Agency of omnivorous animals.</i>&mdash;The number of species which are
nearly omnivorous is considerable; and although every animal has, perhaps,
a predilection for some one description of food rather than another,
yet some are not even confined to one of the great kingdoms of the organic
world. Thus, when the raccoon of the West Indies can procure
neither fowls, fish, snails, nor insects, it will attack the sugar-canes, and
devour various kinds of grain. The civets, when animal food is scarce,
maintain themselves on fruits and roots.</p>

<p>Numerous birds, which feed indiscriminately on insects and plants,
are perhaps more instrumental than any other of the terrestrial tribes in
preserving a constant equilibrium between the relative numbers of different
classes of animals and vegetables. If the insects become very numerous
and devour the plants, these birds will immediately derive a
larger portion of their subsistence from insects, just as the Arabians,
Syrians, and Hottentots feed on locusts, when the locusts devour their
crops.</p>

<p><i>Reciprocal influence of aquatic and terrestrial species.</i>&mdash;The intimate
relation of the inhabitants of the water to those of the land, and the influence
exerted by each on the relative number of species, must not be
overlooked amongst the complicated causes which determine the existence
of animals and plants in certain regions. A large portion of the
amphibious quadrupeds and reptiles prey partly on aquatic plants and
animals, and in part on terrestrial; and a deficiency of one kind of prey
causes them to have immediate recourse to the other. The voracity of
certain insects, as the dragon-fly, for example, is confined to the water
during one stage of their transformations, and in their perfect state to the
air. Innumerable water-birds, both of rivers and seas, derive in like
manner their food indifferently from either element; so that the abundance
or scarcity of prey in one induces them either to forsake or more
constantly to haunt the other. Thus an intimate connection between
the state of the animate creation in a lake or river, and in the adjoining
dry land, is maintained; or between a continent, with its lakes and rivers,
and the ocean. It is well known that many birds migrate, during
stormy seasons, from the sea-shore into the interior, in search of food;
while others, on the contrary, urged by like wants, forsake their inland
haunts, and live on substances rejected by the tide.</p>

<p>The migration of fish into rivers during the spawning season supplies
another link of the same kind. Suppose the salmon to be reduced in
numbers by some marine foes, as by seals and grampuses, the consequence
must often be, that in the course of a few years the otters at the distance
of several hundred miles inland will be lessened in number from the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_677" id="Page_677">677</a></span>
scarcity of fish. On the other hand, if there be a dearth of food for the
young fry of the salmon in rivers and estuaries, so that few return to the
sea, the sand eels and other marine species, which are usually kept down
by the salmon, will swarm in greater profusion.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to accumulate a greater number of illustrations
in order to prove that the stations of different plants and animals
depend on a great complication of circumstances,&mdash;on an immense
variety of relations in the state of the inanimate worlds. Every plant
requires a certain climate, soil, and other conditions, and often the aid
of many animals, in order to maintain its ground. Many animals feed
on certain plants, being often restricted to a small number, and sometimes
to one only; other members of the animal kingdom feed on
plant-eating species, and thus become dependent on the conditions of
the <i>stations</i> not only of their prey, but of the plants consumed by them.</p>

<p>Having duly reflected on the nature and extent of these mutual
relations in the different parts of the organic and inorganic worlds, we
may next proceed to examine the results which may be anticipated
from the fluctuations now continually in progress in the state of the
earth's surface, and in the geographical distribution of its living productions.</p>

<h6>EXTINCTION OF SPECIES.&mdash;CHANGES IN THE STATIONS OF ANIMALS.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Extension of the range of one species alters the condition of many others&mdash;The
first appearance of a new species causes the chief disturbance&mdash;Changes
known to have resulted from the advance of human population&mdash;Whether

<p>We have seen that the stations of animals and plants depend not
merely on the influence of external agents in the inanimate world, and
the relations of that influence to the structure and habits of each species,
but also on the state of the contemporary living beings which
inhabit the same part of the globe. In other words, the possibility of
the existence of a certain species in a given place, or of its thriving
more or less therein, is determined not merely by temperature, humidity,
soil, elevation, and other circumstances of the like kind; but also
by the existence or non-existence, the abundance or scarcity, of a particular
assemblage of other plants and animals in the same region.</p>

<p>If it be shown that both these classes of circumstances, whether
relating to the animate or inanimate creation, are perpetually changing,
it will follow that species are subject to incessant vicissitudes; and if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_678" id="Page_678">678</a></span>
the result of these mutations, in the course of ages, be so great as
materially to affect the general condition of <i>stations</i>, it will follow that
the successive destruction of species must now be part of the regular
and constant order of nature.</p>

<p><i>Extension of the range of one species alters the condition of the others.</i>&mdash;It
will be desirable, first, to consider the effects which every extension
of the numbers or geographical range of one species must produce on
the condition of others inhabiting the same regions. When the necessary
consequences of such extensions have been fully explained, the
reader will be prepared to appreciate the important influence which
slight modifications in the physical geography of the globe may exert
on the condition of organic beings.</p>

<p>In the first place, it is clear that when any region is stocked with as
great a variety of animals and plants as the productive powers of that
region will enable it to support, the addition of any new species, or the
<i>permanent</i> numerical increase of one previously established, must always
be attended either by the local extermination or the numerical decrease
of some other species.</p>

<p>There may undoubtedly be considerable fluctuations from year to
year, and the equilibrium may be again restored without any permanent
alteration; for, in particular seasons, a greater supply of heat, humidity,
or other causes, may augment the total quantity of vegetable produce,
in which case all the animals subsisting on vegetable food, and others
which prey on them, may multiply without any one species giving way:
but whilst the aggregate quantity of vegetable produce remains unaltered,
the progressive increase of one animal or plant implies the decline of
another.</p>

<p>All agriculturists and gardeners are familiar with the fact that when
weeds intrude themselves into the space appropriated to cultivated species,
the latter are starved in their growth, or stifled. If we abandon
for a short time a field or garden, a host of indigenous plants,</p>

<p class="center2">
The darnel, hemlock, and rank fumitory,
</p>

<p>pour in and obtain the mastery, extirpating the exotics, or putting an
end to the monopoly of some native plants.</p>

<p>If we inclose a park, and stock it with as many deer as the herbage
will support, we cannot add sheep without lessening the number of the
deer; nor can other herbivorous species be subsequently introduced, unless
the individuals of each species in the park become fewer in proportion.</p>

<p>So, if there be an island where leopards are the only beasts of prey,
and the lion, tiger, and hy&aelig;na afterwards enter, the leopards, if they
stand their ground, will be reduced in number. If the locusts then
arrive and swarm greatly, they may deprive a large number of plant-eating
animals of their food, and thereby cause a famine, not only
among them, but among the beasts of prey: certain species perhaps,
which had the weakest footing in the island, may thus be annihilated.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_679" id="Page_679">679</a></span>
We have seen how many distinct geographical provinces there are of
aquatic and terrestrial species, and how great are the powers of migration
conferred on different classes, whereby the inhabitants of one region
may be enabled from time to time to invade another, and do actually so
migrate and diffuse themselves over new countries. Now, although our
knowledge of the history of the animate creation dates from so recent a
period, that we can scarcely trace the advance or decline of any animal
or plant, except in those cases where the influence of man has intervened;
yet we can easily conceive what must happen when some new colony of
wild animals or plants enters a region for the first time, and succeeds in
establishing itself.</p>

<p><i>Supposed effects of the first entrance of the polar bear into Iceland.</i>&mdash;Let
us consider how great are the devastations committed at certain
periods by the Greenland bears, when they are drifted to the shores of
Iceland in considerable numbers on the ice. These periodical invasions
are formidable even to man; so that when the bears arrive, the inhabitants
collect together, and go in pursuit of them with fire-arms&mdash;each
native who slays one being rewarded by the King of Denmark. The
Danes of old, when they landed in their marauding expeditions upon our
coast, hardly excited more alarm, nor did our islanders muster more
promptly for the defence of their lives and property against the common
enemy, than the modern Icelanders against these formidable brutes. It
often happens, says Henderson, that the natives are pursued by the bear
when he has been long at sea, and when his natural ferocity has been
heightened by the keenness of hunger; if unarmed, it is frequently by
stratagem only that they make their escape.<a name="FNanchor_965" id="FNanchor_965"></a><a href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a></p>

<p>Let us cast our thoughts back to the period when the first polar bears
reached Iceland, before it was colonized by the Norwegians in 874: we
may imagine the breaking up of an immense barrier of ice like that
which, in 1816 and the following year, disappeared from the east coast
of Greenland, which it had surrounded for four centuries. By the aid of
such means of transportation a great number of these quadrupeds might
effect a landing at the same time, and the havoc which they would make
among the species previously settled in the island would be terrific. The
deer, foxes, seals, and even birds, on which these animals sometimes prey,
would be soon thinned down.</p>

<p>But this would be a part only, and probably an insignificant portion,
of the aggregate amount of change brought about by the new invader.
The plants on which the deer fed, being less consumed in consequence of
the lessened numbers of that herbivorous species, would soon supply more
food to several insects, and probably to some terrestrial testacea, so that
the latter would gain ground. The increase of these would furnish other
insects and birds with food, so that the numbers of these last would be
augmented. The diminution of the seals would afford a respite to some
fish which they had persecuted; and these fish, in their turn, would then
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_680" id="Page_680">680</a></span>
multiply and press upon their peculiar prey. Many water-fowls, the eggs
and young of which are devoured by foxes, would increase when the foxes
were thinned down by the bears; and the fish on which the water-fowls
subsisted would then, in their turn, be less numerous. Thus the numerical
proportions of a great number of the inhabitants, both of the land and
sea, might be permanently altered by the settling of one new species in
the region; and the changes caused indirectly would ramify through all
classes of the living creation, and be almost endless.</p>

<p>An actual illustration of what we have here only proposed hypothetically,
is in some degree afforded by the selection of small islands by the
eider duck for its residence during the season of incubation, its nest being
seldom if ever found on the shores of the main land, or even of a large
island. The Icelanders are so well aware of this, that they have expended
a great deal of labor in forming artificial islands, by separating from the
main land certain promontories, joined to it by narrow isthmuses. This
insular position is necessary to guard against the destruction of the eggs
and young birds, by foxes, dogs, and other animals. One year, says
Hooker, it happened that, in the small island of Vidoe, adjoining the coast
of Iceland, a fox got over <i>upon the ice</i>, and caused great alarm, as an immense
number of ducks were then sitting on their eggs or young ones.
It was long before he was taken, which was at last, however, effected by
bringing another fox to the island, and fastening it by a string near the
haunt of the former, by which he was allured within shot of the hunter.<a name="FNanchor_966" id="FNanchor_966"></a><a href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a></p>

<p><i>The first appearance of a new species causes the chief disturbance.</i>&mdash;It
is usually the first appearance of an animal or plant, in a region to which
it was previously a stranger, that gives rise to the chief alteration; since,
after a time, an equilibrium is again established. But it must require
ages before such a new adjustment of the relative forces of so many conflicting
agents can be definitely settled. The causes in simultaneous
action are so numerous, that they admit of an almost infinite number of
combinations; and it is necessary that all these should have occurred once
before the total amount of change, capable of flowing from any new disturbing
force, can be estimated.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, suppose that once in two centuries a frost of unusual
intensity, or a volcanic eruption of great violence accompanied by
floods from the melting of glaciers, should occur in Iceland; or an epidemic
disease, fatal to the larger number of individuals of some one species,
and not affecting others,&mdash;these, and a variety of other contingencies, all
of which may occur at once, or at periods separated by different intervals
of time, ought to happen before it would be possible for us to declare what
ultimate alteration the presence of any new comer, such as the bear before
mentioned, might occasion in the animal population of the isle.</p>

<p>Every new condition in the state of the organic or inorganic creation,
a new animal or plant, an additional snow-clad mountain, any permanent
change, however slight in comparison to the whole, gives rise to a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_681" id="Page_681">681</a></span>
new order of things, and may make a material change in regard to some
one or more species. Yet a swarm of locusts, or a frost of extreme
intensity, or an epidemic disease, may pass away without any great
apparent derangement; no species may be lost, and all may soon
recover their former relative numbers, because the same scourges may
have visited the region again and again, at preceding periods. Every
plant that was incapable of resisting such a degree of cold, every animal
which was exposed to be entirely cut off by an epidemic or by famine
caused by the consumption of vegetation by the locusts, may have
perished already, so that the subsequent recurrence of similar catastrophes
is attended only by a temporary change.</p>

<h5><i>Changes caused by Man</i></h5>

<p>We are best acquainted with the mutations brought about by the
progress of human population, and the growth of plants and animals
favored by man. To these, therefore, we should in the first instance
turn our attention. If we conclude, from the concurrent testimony of
history and of the evidence yielded by geological data, that man is,
comparatively speaking, of very modern origin, we must at once perceive
how great a revolution in the state of the animate world the increase
of the human race, considered merely as consumers of a certain quantity
of organic matter, must necessarily cause.</p>

<p><i>Whether man increases the productive powers of the earth.</i>&mdash;It may
perhaps, be said, that man has, in some degree, compensated for the
appropriation to himself of so much food, by artificially improving the
natural productiveness of soils, by irrigation, manure, and a judicious
intermixture of mineral ingredients conveyed from different localities.
But it admits of reasonable doubt whether, upon the whole, we fertilize
or impoverish the lands which we occupy. This assertion may seem
startling to many; because they are so much in the habit of regarding
the sterility or productiveness of land in relation to the wants of man,
and not as regards the organic world generally. It is difficult, at first,
to conceive, if a morass is converted into arable land, and made to yield
a crop of grain, even of moderate abundance, that we have not improved
the capabilities of the habitable surface&mdash;that we have not empowered
it to support a larger quantity of organic life. In such cases, however,
a tract, before of no utility to man, may be reclaimed, and become of
high agricultural importance, though it may, nevertheless, yield a
scantier vegetation. If a lake be drained, and turned into a meadow,
the space will provide sustenance to man, and many terrestrial animals
serviceable to him, but not, perhaps, so much food as it previously yielded
to the aquatic races.</p>

<p>If the pestiferous Pontine marshes were drained, and covered with
corn, like the plains of the Po, they might, perhaps, feed a smaller
number of animals than they do now; for these morasses are filled with
herds of buffaloes and swine, and they swarm with birds, reptiles, and
insects.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_682" id="Page_682">682</a></span>
The felling of dense and lofty forests, which covered, even within the
records of history, a considerable space on the globe, now tenanted by
civilized man, must generally have lessened the amount of vegetable
food throughout the space where these woods grew. We must also
take into our account the area covered by towns, and a still larger surface
occupied by roads.</p>

<p>If we force the soil to bear extraordinary crops one year, we are,
perhaps, compelled to let it lie fallow the next. But nothing so much
counterbalances the fertilizing effects of human art as the extensive
cultivation of foreign herbs and shrubs, which, although they are often
more nutritious to man, seldom thrive with the same rank luxuriance as
the native plants of a district. Man is, in truth, continually striving to
diminish the natural diversity of the <i>stations</i> of animals and plants in
every country, and to reduce them all to a small number fitted for
species of economical use. He may succeed perfectly in attaining his
object, even though the vegetation be comparatively meagre, and the
total amount of animal life be greatly lessened.</p>

<p>Spix and Martius have given a lively description of the incredible
number of insects which lay waste the crops in Brazil, besides swarms
of monkeys, flocks of parrots, and other birds, as well as the paca,
agouti, and wild swine. They describe the torment which the planter
and the naturalist suffer from the musquitoes, and the devastation of
the ants and blatt&aelig;; they speak of the dangers to which they were
exposed from the jaguar, the poisonous serpents, crocodiles, scorpions,
centipedes, and spiders. But with the increasing population and cultivation
of the country, say these naturalists, these evils will gradually
diminish; when the inhabitants have cut down the woods, drained the
marshes, made roads in all directions, and founded villages and towns,
man will, by degrees, triumph over the rank vegetation and the noxious
animals, and all the elements will second and amply recompense his
activity.<a name="FNanchor_967" id="FNanchor_967"></a><a href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a></p>

<p>The number of human beings now peopling the earth is supposed to
amount to eight hundred millions, so that we may easily understand
how great a number of beasts of prey, birds, and animals of every class,
this prodigious population must have displaced, independently of the
still more important consequences which have followed from the
derangement brought about by man in the relative numerical strength
of particular species.</p>

<p><i>Indigenous quadrupeds and birds extirpated in Great Britain.</i>&mdash;Let
us make some inquiries into the extent of the influence which the progress
of society has exerted during the last seven or eight centuries, in
altering the distribution of indigenous British animals. Dr. Fleming
has prosecuted this inquiry with his usual zeal and ability; and in a
memoir on the subject has enumerated the best-authenticated examples
of the decrease or extirpation of certain species during a period when
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_683" id="Page_683">683</a></span>
our population has made the most rapid advances. I shall offer a brief
outline of his results.<a name="FNanchor_968" id="FNanchor_968"></a><a href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a></p>

<p>The stag, as well as the fallow deer and the roe, were formerly so
abundant in our island, that, according to Lesley, from five hundred to
a thousand were sometimes slain at a hunting match; but the native
races would already have been extinguished, had they not been carefully
preserved in certain forests. The otter, the marten, and the
polecat, were also in sufficient numbers to be pursued for the sake of
their fur; but they have now been reduced within very narrow bounds.
The wild cat and fox have also been sacrificed throughout the greater
part of the country, for the security of the poultry-yard or the fold.
Badgers have been expelled from nearly every district, which at former
periods they inhabited.</p>

<p>Besides these, which have been driven out from their favorite haunts,
and everywhere reduced in number, there are some which have been
wholly extirpated; such as the ancient breed of indigenous horses, and
the wild boar; of the wild oxen a few remains are still preserved in
some of the old English parks. The beaver, which is eagerly sought
after for its fur, had become scarce at the close of the ninth century;
and, by the twelfth century, was only to be met with, according to
Giraldus de Barri, in one river in Wales, and another in Scotland. The
wolf, once so much dreaded by our ancestors, is said to have maintained
its ground in Ireland so late as the beginning of the eighteenth century
(1710), though it had been extirpated in Scotland thirty years before,
and in England at a much earlier period. The bear, which, in Wales,
was regarded as a beast of the chase equal to the hare or the boar<a name="FNanchor_969" id="FNanchor_969"></a><a href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a>,
only perished, as a native of Scotland, in the year 1057.<a name="FNanchor_970" id="FNanchor_970"></a><a href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a></p>

<p>Many native birds of prey have also been the subjects of unremitting
persecution. The eagles, larger hawks, and ravens, have disappeared
from the more cultivated districts. The haunts of the mallard, the snipe,
the redshank, and the bittern, have been drained equally with the
summer dwellings of the lapwing and the curlew. But these species still
linger in some portion of the British isles; whereas the larger capercailzies
or wood grouse, formerly natives of the pine-forests of Ireland and Scotland,
have been destroyed within the last sixty years. The egret and
the crane, which appear to have been formerly very common in Scotland,
are now only occasional visitants.<a name="FNanchor_971" id="FNanchor_971"></a><a href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a></p>

<p>The bustard (<i>Otis tarda</i>), observes Graves, in his British Ornithology<a name="FNanchor_972" id="FNanchor_972"></a><a href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a>,
"was formerly seen in the downs and heaths of various parts of
our island, in flocks of forty or fifty birds; whereas it is now a circumstance
of rare occurrence to meet with a single individual." Bewick
also remarks, "that they were formerly more common in this island
than at present; they are now found only in the open counties of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_684" id="Page_684">684</a></span>
south and east&mdash;in the plains of Wiltshire, Dorsetshire, and some parts
of Yorkshire."<a name="FNanchor_973" id="FNanchor_973"></a><a href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a> In the few years that have elapsed since Bewick
wrote, this bird has entirely disappeared from Wiltshire and Dorsetshire.</p>

<p>These changes, it may be observed, are derived from very imperfect
memorials, and relate only to the larger and more conspicuous animals
inhabiting a small spot on the globe; but they cannot fail to exalt our
conception of the enormous revolutions which, in the course of several
thousand years, the whole human species must have effected.</p>

<p><i>Extinction of the dodo.</i>&mdash;The kangaroo and the emu are retreating
rapidly before the progress of colonization in Australia; and it scarcely
admits of doubt, that the general cultivation of that country must lead
to the extirpation of both. The most striking example of the loss,
even within the last two centuries, of a remarkable species, is that of
the dodo&mdash;a bird first seen by the Dutch, when they landed on the Isle
of France, at that time uninhabited, immediately after the discovery of
the passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. It was of
a large size, and singular form; its wings short, like those of an ostrich,
and wholly incapable of sustaining its heavy body, even for a short
flight. In its general appearance it differed from the ostrich, cassowary,
or any known bird.<a name="FNanchor_974" id="FNanchor_974"></a><a href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a></p>

<p>Many naturalists gave figures of the dodo after the commencement
of the seventeenth century; and there is a painting of it in the British
Museum, which is said to have been taken from a living individual.
Beneath the painting is a leg, in a fine state of preservation, which ornithologists
are agreed cannot belong to any other known bird. In the
museum at Oxford, also, there is a foot and a head in an imperfect state.</p>

<p>In spite of the most active search, during the last century, no information
respecting the dodo was obtained, and some authors have gone
so far as to pretend that it never existed; but a great mass of satisfactory
evidence in favor of its recent existence has now been collected
by Mr. Broderip,<a name="FNanchor_975" id="FNanchor_975"></a><a href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a> and by Mr. Strickland and Dr. Melville. Mr. Strickland,
agreeing with Professor Reinhardt, of Copenhagen, in referring
the dodo to the Columbid&aelig;, calls it a "vulture-like frugivorous pigeon."
It appears, also, that another short-winged bird of the same order, called
"The Solitaire," inhabited the small island of Rodrigues, 300 miles east
of the Mauritius, and has been exterminated by man, as have one or
two different but allied birds of the Isle of Bourbon.<a name="FNanchor_976" id="FNanchor_976"></a><a href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_685" id="Page_685">685</a></span>
<i>Rapid propagation of domestic quadrupeds over the American continent.</i>&mdash;Next
to the direct agency of man, his indirect influence in
multiplying the numbers of large herbivorous quadrupeds of domesticated
races may be regarded as one of the most obvious causes of the
extermination of species. On this, and on several other grounds, the
introduction of the horse, ox, and other mammalia, into America, and
their rapid propagation over that continent within the last three centuries,
is a fact of great importance in natural history. The extraordinary
herds of wild cattle and horses which overran the plains of South
America sprung from a very few pairs first carried over by the Spaniards;
and they prove that the wide geographical range of large species in
great continents does not necessarily imply that they have existed there
from remote periods.</p>

<p>Humboldt observes, in his Travels, on the authority of Azzara, that
it is believed there exist, in the Pampas of Buenos Ayres, twelve million
cows and three million horses, without comprising, in this enumeration,
the cattle that have no acknowledged proprietor. In the Llanos of Caraccas,
the rich hateros, or proprietors of pastoral farms, are entirely ignorant
of the number of cattle they possess. The young are branded
with a mark peculiar to each herd, and some of the most wealthy
owners mark as many as fourteen thousand a year.<a name="FNanchor_977" id="FNanchor_977"></a><a href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> In the northern
plains, from the Orinoco to the lake of Maraycabo, M. Depons reckoned
that 1,200,000 oxen, 180,000 horses, and 90,000 mules, wandered at
large.<a name="FNanchor_978" id="FNanchor_978"></a><a href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a> In some parts of the valley of the Mississippi, especially in the
country of the Osage Indians, wild horses are immensely numerous.</p>

<p>The establishment of black cattle in America dates from Columbus's
second voyage to St. Domingo. They there multiplied rapidly; and
that island presently became a kind of nursery from which these animals
were successively transported to various parts of the continental
coast, and from thence into the interior. Notwithstanding these
numerous exportations, in twenty-seven years after the discovery of the
island, herds of four thousand head, as we learn from Oviedo, were not
uncommon, and there were even some that amounted to eight thousand.
In 1587, the number of hides exported from St. Domingo alone, according
to Acosta's report, was 35,444; and in the same year there were
exported 64,350 from the ports of New Spain. This was in the sixty-fifth
year after the taking of Mexico, previous to which event the
Spaniards, who came into that country, had not been able to engage in
anything else than war.<a name="FNanchor_979" id="FNanchor_979"></a><a href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a> Every one is aware that these animals are
now established throughout the American continent from Canada to
the Straits of Magellan.</p>

<p>The ass has thriven very generally in the New World; and we learn
from Ulloa, that in Quito they ran wild, and multiplied in amazing
numbers, so as to become a nuisance. They grazed together in herds,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_686" id="Page_686">686</a></span>
and when attacked defended themselves with their mouths. If a horse
happened to stray into the places where they fed, they all fell upon him,
and did not cease biting and kicking till they left him dead.<a name="FNanchor_980" id="FNanchor_980"></a><a href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">980</a></p>

<p>The first hogs were carried to America by Columbus, and established
in the Island of St. Domingo the year following its discovery, in
November, 1493. In succeeding years they were introduced into other
places where the Spaniards settled; and, in the space of half a century,
they were found established in the New World, from the latitude of
25&deg; north, to the 40th degree of south latitude. Sheep, also, and
goats have multiplied enormously in the New World, as have also the
cat and the rat; which last, as before stated, has been imported unintentionally
in ships. The dogs introduced by man which have at
different periods become wild in America, hunted in packs, like the
wolf and the jackall, destroying not only hogs, but the calves and
foals of the wild cattle and horses.</p>

<p>Ulloa in his voyage, and Buffon on the authority of old writers, relate
a fact which illustrates very clearly the principle before explained, of
the check which the increase of one animal necessarily offers to that of
another. The Spaniards had introduced goats into the Island of Juan
Fernandez, where they became so prolific as to furnish the pirates who
infested those seas with provisions. In order to cut off this resource
from the buccaneers, a number of dogs were turned loose into the island;
and so numerous did they become in their turn, that they destroyed the
goats in every accessible part, after which the number of the wild dogs
again decreased.<a name="FNanchor_981" id="FNanchor_981"></a><a href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">981</a></p>

<p><i>Increase of rein-deer imported into Iceland.</i>&mdash;As an example of the
rapidity with which a large tract may become peopled by the offspring
of a single pair of quadrupeds, it may be mentioned that in the year
1773 thirteen rein-deer were exported from Norway, only three of which
reached Iceland. These were turned loose into the mountains of Guldbring&egrave;
Syssel, where they multiplied so greatly, in the course of forty
years, that it was not uncommon to meet with herds, consisting of from
forty to one hundred, in various districts.</p>

<p>The rein-deer, observes a modern writer, is in Lapland a loser by his
connexion with man, but Iceland will be this creature's paradise.
There is, in the interior, a tract which Sir. G. Mackenzie computes at
not less than forty thousand square miles, without a single human habitation,
and almost entirely unknown to the natives themselves. There
are no wolves: the Icelanders will keep out the bears; and the reindeer,
being almost unmolested by man, will have no enemy whatever,
unless it has brought with it its own tormenting gad-fly.<a name="FNanchor_982" id="FNanchor_982"></a><a href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">982</a></p>

<p>Besides the quadrupeds before enumerated, our domestic fowls have
also succeeded in the West Indies and America, where they have the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_687" id="Page_687">687</a></span>
common fowl, the goose, the duck, the peacock, the pigeon, and the
guinea-fowl. As these were often taken suddenly from the temperate
to very hot regions, they were not reared at first without much difficulty:
but after a few generations, they became familiarized to the climate,
which, in many cases, approached much nearer than that of Europe to
the temperature of their original native countries.</p>

<p>The fact of so many millions of wild and tame individuals of our domestic
species, almost all of them the largest quadrupeds and birds,
having been propagated throughout the new continent within the short
period that has elapsed since the discovery of America, while no appreciable
improvement can have been made in the productive powers of
that vast continent, affords abundant evidence of the extraordinary
changes which accompany the diffusion and progressive advancement of
the human race over the globe. That it should have remained for us to
witness such mighty revolutions is a proof, even if there was no other
evidence, that the entrance of man into the planet is, comparatively
speaking, of extremely modern date, and that the effects of his agency
are only beginning to be felt.</p>

<p><i>Population which the globe is capable of supporting.</i>&mdash;A modern
writer has estimated, that there are in America upwards of four million
square miles of useful soil, each capable of supporting 200 persons; and
nearly six million, each mile capable of supporting 490 persons.<a name="FNanchor_983" id="FNanchor_983"></a><a href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a> If this
conjecture be true, it will follow, as that author observes, that if the
natural resources of America were fully developed, it would afford sustenance
to five times as great a number of inhabitants as the entire mass
of human beings existing at present upon the globe. The new continent,
he thinks, though less than half the size of the old, contains an equal
quantity of useful soil, and much more than an equal amount of productive
power. Be this as it may, we may safely conclude that the amount
of human population now existing constitutes but a small proportion of
that which the globe is capable of supporting, or which it is destined to
sustain at no distant period, by the rapid progress of society, especially
in America, Australia, and certain parts of the old continent.</p>

<p><i>Power of exterminating species no prerogative of man.</i>&mdash;But if we reflect
that many millions of square miles of the most fertile land, occupied
originally by a boundless variety of animal and vegetable forms, have
been already brought under the dominion of man, and compelled, in a
great measure, to yield nourishment to him, and to a limited number of
plants and animals which he has caused to increase, we must at once be
convinced, that the annihilation of a multitude of species has already been
effected, and will continue to go on hereafter, in certain regions, in a still
more rapid ratio, as the colonies of highly civilized nations spread themselves
over unoccupied lands.</p>

<p>Yet, if we wield the sword of extermination as we advance, we have no
reason to repine at the havoc committed, nor to fancy, with the Scottish
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_688" id="Page_688">688</a></span>
poet, that "we violate the social union of nature;" or complain, with the
melancholy Jacques, that we</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,</span>
<span class="i0">To fright the animals and to kill them up</span>
<span class="i0">In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have only to reflect, that in thus obtaining possession of the earth
by conquest, and defending our acquisitions by force, we exercise no exclusive
prerogative. Every species which has spread itself from a small
point over a wide area must, in like manner, have marked its progress
by the diminution or the entire extirpation of some other, and must
maintain its ground by a successful struggle against the encroachments of
other plants and animals. That minute parasitic plant, called "the rust" in
wheat, has, like the Hessian fly, the locust, and the aphis, caused famines
ere now amongst the "lords of the creation." The most insignificant and
diminutive species, whether in the animal or vegetable kingdom, have
each slaughtered their thousands, as they disseminated themselves over
the globe, as well as the lion, when first it spread itself over the tropical
regions of Africa.</p>

<p><i>Concluding remarks.</i>&mdash;Although we have as yet considered one class
only of the causes (the organic) by which species may become exterminated,
yet it cannot but appear evident that the continued action of these
alone, throughout myriads of future ages, must work an entire change
in the state of the organic creation, not merely on the continents and
islands, where the power of man is chiefly exerted, but in the great
ocean, where his control is almost unknown. The mind is prepared by
the contemplation of such future revolutions to look for the signs of
others, of an analogous nature, in the monuments of the past. Instead
of being astonished at the proofs there manifested of endless mutations
in the animate world, they will appear to one who has thought profoundly
on the fluctuations now in progress, to afford evidence in favor of the
uniformity of the system, unless, indeed, we are precluded from speaking
of <i>uniformity</i> when we characterize a principle of endless variation.</p>

<p><i>Powers of diffusion indispensable, that each species may maintain its
ground.</i>&mdash;Having shown in the last chapter, how considerably the
numerical increase or the extension of the geographical range of any
one species must derange the numbers and distribution of others, let us
now direct our attention to the influence which the inorganic causes
described in the second book are continually exerting on the habitations
of species.</p>

<p>So great is the instability of the earth's surface, that if nature were
not continually engaged in the task of sowing seeds and colonizing
animals, the depopulation of a certain portion of the habitable sea and
land would in a few years be considerable. Whenever a river transports
sediment into a lake or sea, so as materially to diminish its depth, the
aquatic animals and plants which delight in deep water are expelled:
the tract, however, is not allowed to remain useless; but is soon peopled
by species which require more light and heat, and thrive where the
water is shallow. Every addition made to the land by the encroachment
of the delta of a river banishes many subaqueous species from
their native abodes; but the new-formed plain is not permitted to lie
unoccupied, being instantly covered with terrestrial vegetation. The
ocean devours continuous lines of sea-coasts, and precipitates forests or
rich pasture land into the waves: but this space is not lost to the
animate creation; for shells and sea-weeds soon adhere to the new-made
cliffs, and numerous fish people the channel which the current has
scooped out for itself. No sooner has a volcanic island been thrown
up than some lichens begin to grow upon it, and it is sometimes clothed
with verdure while smoke and ashes are still occasionally thrown from
the crater. The cocoa, pandanus, and mangrove take root upon the
coral reef before it has fairly risen above the waves. The burning
stream of lava that descends from Etna rolls through the stately forest,
and converts to ashes every tree and herb which stands in its way; but
the black strip of land thus desolated is covered again in the course of
time, with oaks, pines, and chestnuts, as luxuriant as those which the
fiery torrent swept away.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_690" id="Page_690">690</a></span>
Every flood and landslip, every wave which a hurricane or earthquake
throws upon the shore, every shower of volcanic dust and ashes
which buries a country far and wide to the depth of many feet, every
advance of the sand-flood, every conversion of salt water into fresh
when rivers alter their main channel of discharge, every permanent
variation in the rise or fall of tides in an estuary&mdash;these and countless
other causes displace, in the course of a few centuries, certain plants
and animals from stations which they previously occupied. If, therefore,
the Author of nature had not been prodigal of those numerous
contrivances, before alluded to, for spreading all classes of organic
beings over the earth&mdash;if he had not ordained that the fluctuations of
the animate and inanimate creation should be in perfect harmony with
each other, it is evident that considerable spaces, now the most habitable
on the globe, would soon be as devoid of life as are the Alpine
snows, or the dark abysses of the ocean, or the moving sands of the
Sahara.</p>

<p>The powers, then, of migration and diffusion conferred on animals
and plants are indispensable to enable them to maintain their ground,
and would be necessary, even though it were never intended that a
species should gradually extend its geographical range. But a facility
of shifting their quarters being once given, it cannot fail to happen that
the inhabitants of one province should occasionally penetrate into some
other; since the strongest of those barriers which I before described as
separating distinct regions are all liable to be thrown down, one after
the other, during the vicissitudes of the earth's surface.</p>

<p><i>How changes in physical Geography affect the distribution of species.</i>&mdash;The
numbers and distribution of particular species are affected in
two ways, by changes in the physical geography of the earth:&mdash;First,
these changes promote or retard the migrations of species; secondly,
they alter the physical conditions of the localities which species inhabit.
If the ocean should gradually wear its way through an isthmus, like
that of Suez, it would open a passage for the intermixture of the aquatic
tribes of two seas previously disjoined, and would, at the same time,
close a free communication which the terrestrial plants and animals of
two continents had before enjoyed. These would be, perhaps, the most
important consequences, in regard to the distribution of species, which
would result from the breach made by the sea in such a spot; but
there would be others of a distinct nature, such as the conversion of a
certain tract of land, which formed the isthmus, into sea. This space,
previously occupied by terrestrial plants and animals, would be immediately
delivered over to the aquatic; a local revolution which might
have happened in innumerable other parts of the globe, without being
attended by any alteration in the blending together of species of two
distinct provinces.</p>

<p><i>Rate of change of species cannot be uniform.</i>&mdash;This observation leads
me to point out one of the most interesting conclusions to which we
are led by the contemplation of the vicissitudes of the inanimate world
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_691" id="Page_691">691</a></span>
in relation to those of the animate. It is clear that, if the agency of
inorganic causes be uniform, as I have supposed, they must operate
very irregularly on the state of organic beings, so that the rate according
to which these will change in particular regions will not be equal in
equal periods of time.</p>

<p>I am not about to advocate the doctrine of general catastrophes
recurring at certain intervals, as in the ancient Oriental cosmogonies, nor
do I doubt that, if very considerable periods of equal duration could be
compared one with another, the rate of change in the living, as well as
in the inorganic world, might be nearly uniform; but if we regard each
of the causes separately, which we know to be at present the most
instrumental in remodelling the state of the surface, we shall find that we
must expect each to be in action for thousands of years, without producing
any extensive alterations in the habitable surface, and then to give rise,
during a very brief period, to important revolutions.</p>

<p><i>Illustration derived from subsidences.</i>&mdash;I shall illustrate this principle
by a few of the most remarkable examples which present themselves. In
the course of the last century, as we have seen, a considerable number of
instances are recorded of the solid surface, whether covered by water or
not, having been permanently sunk or upraised by subterranean movements.
Most of these convulsions are only accompanied by temporary
fluctuations in the state of limited districts, and a continued repetition of
these events for thousands of years might not produce any decided change
in the state of many of those great zoological or botanical provinces of
which I have sketched the boundaries.</p>

<p>When, for example, large parts of the ocean and even of inland seas
are a thousand fathoms or upwards in depth, it is a matter of no moment
to the animate creation that vast tracts should be heaved up many fathoms
at certain intervals, or should subside to the same amount. Neither can
any material revolution be produced in South America either in the terrestrial
or the marine plants or animals by a series of shocks on the coast
of Chili, each of which, like that of Penco, in 1751, should uplift the
coast about twenty-five feet. Nor if the ground sinks fifty feet at a time,
as in the harbor of Port Royal, in Jamaica, in 1692, will such alterations
of level work any general fluctuations in the state of organic beings
inhabiting the West Indian Islands, or the Caribbean Sea.</p>

<p>It is only when the subterranean powers, by shifting gradually the
points where their principal force is developed, happen to strike upon
some particular region where a slight change of level immediately affects
the distribution of land and water, or the state of the climate, or the
barriers between distinct groups of species over extensive areas, that the
rate of fluctuation becomes accelerated, and may, in the course of a few
years or centuries, work mightier changes than had been experienced in
myriads of antecedent years.</p>

<p>Thus, for example, a repetition of subsidences causing the narrow
isthmus of Panama to sink down a few hundred feet, would, in a few
centuries, bring about a great revolution in the state of the animate creation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_692" id="Page_692">692</a></span>
in the western hemisphere. Thousands of aquatic species would pass,
for the first time, from the Caribbean Sea into the Pacific; and thousands
of others, before peculiar to the Pacific Ocean, would make their way
into the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic. A considerable
modification would probably be occasioned by the same event
in the direction or volume of the Gulf stream, and thereby the temperature
of the sea and the contiguous lands might be altered as far as the
influence of that current extends. A change of climate might thus be
produced in the ocean from Florida to Spitzbergen, and in many countries
of North America, Europe, and Greenland. Not merely the heat, but
the quantity of rain which falls, would be altered in certain districts, so
that many species would be excluded from tracts where they before
flourished: others would be reduced in number; and some would thrive
more and multiply. The seeds also and the fruits of plants would no
longer be drifted in precisely the same directions, nor the eggs of aquatic
animals; neither would species be any longer impeded in their migrations
towards particular stations before shut out from them by their inability
to cross the mighty current.</p>

<p>Let us take another example from a part of the globe which is at
present liable to suffer by earthquakes, namely, the low sandy tract which
intervenes between the sea of Azof and the Caspian. If there should
occur a sinking down to a trifling amount, and such ravines should be
formed as might be produced by a few earthquakes, not more considerable
than have fallen within our limited observation during the last 150
years, the waters of the Sea of Azof would pour rapidly into the Caspian,
which, according to the measurements lately made by the Academy of
St. Petersburg, is 84 feet below the level of the Black Sea.<a name="FNanchor_984" id="FNanchor_984"></a><a href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a> The Sea
of Azof would immediately borrow from the Black Sea, that sea again
from the Mediterranean, and the Mediterranean from the Atlantic, so that
an inexhaustible current would pour down into the low tracts of Asia
bordering the Caspian, by which all the sandy salt steppes adjacent to
that sea would be inundated. An area of several thousand square leagues,
now below the level of the Mediterranean, would be converted from land
into sea.</p>

<p><i>Illustration derived from the elevation of land.</i>&mdash;Let us next imagine
a few cases of the elevation of land of small extent at certain critical
points, as, for example, in the shallowest part of the Straits of Gibraltar,
where the deepest soundings from the African to the European side give
only 220 fathoms. In proportion as this submarine barrier of rock was
upheaved, the whole channel would be contracted in width and depth,
and the volume of water which the current constantly flowing from the
Atlantic pours into the Mediterranean would be lessened. But the loss
of the inland sea by evaporation would remain the same; so that being
no longer able to draw on the ocean for a supply sufficient to restore its
equilibrium, it must sink, and leave dry a certain portion of land around
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_693" id="Page_693">693</a></span>
its borders. The current which now flows constantly out of the Black
Sea into the Mediterranean would then rush in more rapidly, and the
level of the Mediterranean would be thereby prevented from falling so
low; but the level of the Black Sea would, for the same reason, sink; so
that when, by a continued series of elevatory movements, the Straits of
Gibraltar had become completely closed up, we might expect large and
level sandy steppes to surround both the Black Sea and Mediterranean,
like those occurring at present on the skirts of the Caspian and the Lake
of Aral. The geographical range of hundreds of aquatic species would be
thereby circumscribed, and that of hundreds of terrestrial plants and
animals extended.</p>

<p>A line of submarine volcanos crossing the channel of some strait, and
gradually choking it up with ashes and lava, might produce a new barrier
as effectually as a series of earthquakes; especially if thermal springs,
charged with carbonate of lime, silica, and other mineral ingredients,
should promote the rapid multiplication of corals and shells, and cement
them together with solid matter precipitated during the intervals between
eruptions. Suppose in this manner a stoppage to be caused of the Bahama
channel between the bank of that name and the coast of Florida.
This insignificant revolution, confined to a mere spot in the bottom of
the ocean, would, by diverting the main current of the Gulf stream, give
rise to extensive changes in the climate and distribution of animals and
plants inhabiting the northern hemisphere.</p>

<p><i>Illustration from the formation of new islands.</i>&mdash;A repetition of elevatory
movements of earthquakes might continue over an area as extensive
as Europe, for thousands of ages, at the bottom of the ocean, in certain
regions, and produce no visible effects; whereas, if they should operate
in some shallow parts of the Pacific, amid the coral archipelagos,
they would soon give birth to a new continent. Hundreds of volcanic
islands may be thrown up, and become covered with vegetation, without
causing more than local fluctuations in the animate world; but if a chain
like the Aleutian archipelago, or the Kurile Isles, run for a distance of
many hundred miles, so as to form an almost uninterrupted communication
between two continents, or two distant islands, the migrations of
plants, birds, insects, and even of some quadrupeds, may cause, in a short
time, an extraordinary series of revolutions tending to augment the range
of some animals and plants, and to limit that of others. A new archipelago
might be formed in the Mediterranean, the Bay of Biscay, and a
thousand other places, and might produce less important events than one
rock which should rise up between Australia and Java, so placed that
winds and currents might cause an interchange of the plants, insects,
and birds.</p>

<p><i>From the wearing through of an isthmus.</i>&mdash;If we turn from the igneous
to the aqueous agents, we find the same tendency to an irregular
rate of change, naturally connected with the strictest uniformity in the
energy of those causes. When the sea, for example, gradually encroaches
upon both sides of a narrow isthmus, as that of Sleswick, separating the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_694" id="Page_694">694</a></span>
North Sea from the Baltic, where, as before stated, the cliffs on both the
opposite coasts are wasting away<a name="FNanchor_985" id="FNanchor_985"></a><a href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor">985</a>, no material alteration results for
thousands of years, save only that there is a progressive conversion of a
small strip of land into water. A few feet only, or a few yards, are annually
removed; but if, at last, the partition should be broken down, and
the tides of the ocean should enter by a direct passage into the inland sea,
instead of going by a circuitous route through the Cattegat, a body of
salt water would sweep up as far as the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland,
the waters of which are now brackish, or almost fresh; and this revolution
would be attended by the local annihilation of many species.</p>

<p>Similar consequences must have resulted on a small scale, when the
sea opened its way through the Isthmus of Staveren in the thirteenth
century, forming a union between an inland lake and the ocean, and
opening, in the course of one century, a shallow strait, more than half as
wide as the narrowest part of that which divides England from France.</p>

<p><i>Changes in physical geography which must occasion extinction of species.</i>&mdash;It
will almost seem superfluous, after I have thus traced the important
modifications in the condition of living beings which flow from changes
of trifling extent, to argue that entire revolutions might be brought
about, if the climate and physical geography of the whole globe were
greatly altered. It has been stated, that species are in general local, some
being confined to extremely small spots, and depending for their existence
on a combination of causes, which, if they are to be met with elsewhere,
occur only in some very remote region. Hence it must happen that,
when the nature of these localities is changed, the species will perish;
for it will rarely happen that the cause which alters the character
of the district will afford new facilities to the species to establish itself
elsewhere.</p>

<p><i>African deserts.</i>&mdash;If we attribute the origin of a great part of the desert
of Africa to the gradual progress of moving sands driven eastward by the
westerly winds, we may safely infer that a variety of species must have been
annihilated by this cause alone. The sand-flood has been inundating, from
time immemorial, some of the rich lands on the west of the Nile; and
we have only to multiply this effect a sufficient number of times in order
to understand how, in the lapse of ages, a whole group of terrestrial animals
and plants may become extinct.</p>

<p>The African desert, without including Bornou and Darfour, extends,
according to the calculation of Humboldt, over 194,000 square leagues;
an area nearly three times as great as that of France. In a small portion
of so vast a space, we may infer from analogy that there were many
peculiar species of plants and animals which must have been banished by
the sand, and their habitations invaded by the camel, and by birds and
insects formed for the arid sands.</p>

<p>There is evidently nothing in the nature of the catastrophe to favor
the escape of the former inhabitants to some adjoining province; nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_695" id="Page_695">695</a></span>
to weaken, in the bordering lands, that powerful barrier against emigration&mdash;pre-occupancy.
Nor, even if the exclusion of a certain group of
species from a given tract were compensated by an extension of their
range over a new country, would that circumstance tend to the conservation
of species in general; for the extirpation would merely then be
transferred to the region so invaded. If it be imagined, for example, that
the aboriginal quadrupeds, birds, and other animals of Africa, emigrated
in consequence of the advance of drift-sand, and colonized Arabia, the
indigenous Arabian species must have given way before them, and have
been reduced in number or destroyed.</p>

<p>Let us next suppose that, in some central or more elevated parts of the
great African desert, the upheaving power of subterranean movements
should be exerted throughout an immense series of ages, accompanied, at
certain intervals, by volcanic eruptions, such as gave rise at once, in 1755,
to a mountain 1600 feet high, on the Mexican plateau. When the continued
repetition of these events had caused a mountain-chain, it is
obvious that a complete transformation in the state of the climate would
be brought about throughout a vast area.</p>

<p>We may imagine the summits of the new chain to rise so high as to
be covered, like Mount Atlas, for several thousand feet, with snow, during
a great part of the year. The melting of these snows, during the greatest
heat, would cause the rivers to swell in the season when the greatest
drought now prevails; the waters, moreover, derived from this source,
would always be of lower temperature than the surrounding atmosphere,
and would thus contribute to cool the climate. During the numerous
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions supposed to accompany the gradual
formation of the chain, there would be many floods caused by the bursting
of temporary lakes, and by the melting of snows by lava. These
inundations might deposit alluvial matter far and wide over the original
sands, as the country assumed varied shapes, and was modified again and
again by the moving power from below, and the aqueous erosion of the
surface above. At length the Sahara might be fertilized, irrigated by rivers
and streamlets intersecting it in every direction, and covered by jungle
and morasses; so that the animals and plants which now people Northern
Africa would disappear, and the region would gradually become fitted
for the reception of a population of species perfectly dissimilar in their
forms, habits, and organization.</p>

<p>There are always some peculiar and characteristic features in the physical
geography of each large division of the globe; and on these
peculiarities the state of animal and vegetable life is dependent. If,
therefore, we admit incessant fluctuations in the physical geography, we
must, at the same time, concede the successive extinction of terrestrial
and aquatic species to be part of the economy of our system. When
some great class of <i>stations</i> is in excess in certain latitudes, as, for example,
in wide savannahs, arid sands, lofty mountains, or inland seas, we find a
corresponding development of species adapted for such circumstances.
In North America, where there is a chain of vast inland lakes of fresh
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_696" id="Page_696">696</a></span>
water, we find an extraordinary abundance and variety of aquatic birds,
fresh-water fish, testacea, and small amphibious reptiles, fitted for such a
climate. The greater part of these would perish if the lakes were
destroyed,&mdash;an event that might be brought about by some of the least
of those important revolutions contemplated in geology. It might
happen that no fresh-water lakes of corresponding magnitude might then
exist on the globe; or that, if they occurred elsewhere, they might be
situated in New Holland, Southern Africa, Eastern Asia, or some region
so distant as to be quite inaccessible to the North American species; or
they might be situated within the tropics, in a climate uninhabitable by
creatures fitted for a temperate zone; or, finally, we may presume that
they would be pre-occupied by <i>indigenous</i> tribes.</p>

<p>A vivid description has been given by Mr. Darwin and Sir W. Parish
of the great droughts which have sometimes visited the Pampas of South
America, for three or four years in succession, during which an incredible
number of wild animals, cattle, horses, and birds, have perished from
want of food and water. Several hundred thousand animals were drowned
in the Parana alone, having rushed into the river to drink, and being
too much exhausted by hunger to escape.<a name="FNanchor_986" id="FNanchor_986"></a><a href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor">986</a> Such droughts are often
attended in South America and other hot climates by wide-spreading
conflagrations, caused by lightning, which fires the dried grass and brush-wood.
Thus quadrupeds, birds, insects, and other creatures, are destroyed
by myriads. How many species, both of the animal and vegetable world,
which once flourished in the country between the valley of the Parana
and the Straits of Magellan, may not have been annihilated, since the first
drought or first conflagration began!</p>

<p>To pursue this train of reasoning farther is unnecessary; the geologist
has only to reflect on what has been said of the habitations and stations
of organic beings in general, and to consider them in relation to those
effects which were contemplated in the second book, as resulting from
the igneous and aqueous causes now in action, and he will immediately
perceive that, amidst the vicissitudes of the earth's surface, species cannot
be immortal, but must perish, one after the other, like the individuals
which compose them. There is no possibility of escaping from this conclusion,
without resorting to some hypothesis as violent as that of
Lamarck, who imagined, as we have before seen, that species are each of
them endowed with indefinite powers of modifying their organization, in
conformity to the endless changes of circumstances to which they are
exposed.</p>

<h5><i>Effects of a general Alteration in Climate on the Distribution of Species.</i></h5>

<p>Some of the effects which must attend every general alteration of <i>climate</i>
are sufficiently peculiar to claim a separate consideration before
concluding the present chapter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_697" id="Page_697">697</a></span>
I have before stated that, during seasons of extraordinary severity,
many northern birds, and in some countries many quadrupeds, migrate
southwards. If these cold seasons were to become frequent, in consequence
of a gradual and general refrigeration of the atmosphere, such
migrations would be more and more regular, until, at length, many
animals, now confined to the arctic regions, would become the tenants
of the temperate zone; while the inhabitants of the temperate zone would
approach nearer to the equator. At the same time, many species previously
established on high mountains would begin to descend, in every
latitude, towards the middle regions; and those which were confined to
the flanks of mountains would make their way into the plains. Analogous
changes would also take place in the vegetable kingdom.</p>

<p>If, on the contrary, the heat of the atmosphere be on the increase, the
plants and animals of low grounds would ascend to higher levels, the
equatorial species would migrate into the temperate zone, and those of
the temperate into the arctic circle.</p>

<p>But although some species might thus be preserved, every great change
of climate must be fatal to many which can find no place of retreat when
their original habitations become unfit for them. For if the general temperature
be on the rise, then there is no cooler region whither the polar
species can take refuge; if it be on the decline, then the animals and
plants previously established between the tropics have no resource. Suppose
the general heat of the atmosphere to increase, so that even the
arctic region became too warm for the musk-ox, and rein-deer, it is clear
that they must perish; so if the torrid zone should lose so much of its
heat, by the progressive refrigeration of the earth's surface, as to be an
unfit habitation for apes, boas, bamboos, and palms, these tribes of animals
and plants, or, at least; most of the species now belonging to them,
would become extinct, for there would be no warmer latitudes for their
reception.</p>

<p>It will follow, therefore, that as often as the climates of the globe are
passing from the extreme of heat to that of cold&mdash;from the summer to
the winter of the great year before alluded to<a name="FNanchor_987" id="FNanchor_987"></a><a href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor">987</a>&mdash;the migratory movement
will be directed constantly from the poles towards the equator; and for
this reason the species inhabiting parallel latitudes, in the northern and
southern hemispheres, must become widely different. For I assume, on
grounds before explained, that the original stock of each species is introduced
into one spot of the earth only, and, consequently, no species can
be at once indigenous in the arctic and antarctic circles.</p>

<p>But when, on the contrary, a series of changes in the physical geography
of the globe, or any other supposed cause, occasions an elevation of
the general temperature,&mdash;when there is a passage from the winter to one
of the vernal or summer seasons of the great cycle of climate,&mdash;then the
order of the migratory movement is inverted. The different species of
animals and plants direct their course from the equator towards the poles;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_698" id="Page_698">698</a></span>
and the northern and southern hemispheres may become peopled to a
certain limited extent by identical species.</p>

<p>I say limited, because we cannot speculate on the entire transposition
of a group of animals and plants from tropical to polar latitudes, or the
reverse, as a probable or even possible event. We may believe the mean
annual temperature of one zone to be transferable to another, but we
know that the same climate cannot be so transferred. Whatever be the
general temperature of the earth's surface, comparative equability of heat
will characterize the tropical regions; while great periodical variations
will belong to the temperate, and still more to the polar latitudes. These,
and many other peculiarities connected with heat and light, depend on
fixed astronomical causes, such as the motion of the earth and its position
in relation to the sun, and not on those fluctuations of its surface which
may influence the general temperature.</p>

<p>Among many obstacles to such extensive transference of habitations,
we must not forget the immense lapse of time required, according to the
hypothesis before suggested, to bring about a considerable change in
climate. During a period so vast, the other cause of extirpation, before
enumerated, would exert so powerful an influence as to prevent all, save
a very few hardy species, from passing from equatorial to polar regions,
or from the tropics to the pole.<a name="FNanchor_988" id="FNanchor_988"></a><a href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor">988</a></p>

<p>But the power of accommodation to new circumstances is great in
certain species, and might enable many to pass from one zone to another,
if the mean annual heat of the atmosphere and the ocean were greatly
altered. To the marine tribes, especially, such a passage would be possible;
for they are less impeded in their migrations by barriers of land,
than are the terrestrial by the ocean. Add to this, that the temperature
of the ocean is much more uniform than that of the atmosphere investing
the land; so that we may easily suppose that most of the testacea, fish,
and other classes, might pass from the equatorial into the temperate
regions, if the mean temperature of those regions were transposed, although
a second expatriation of these species of tropical origin into the arctic and
antarctic circles would probably be impossible.</p>

<p>Let us now consider more particularly the effect of vicissitudes of
climate in causing one species to give way before the increasing numbers
of some other.</p>

<p>When temperature forms the barrier which arrests the progress of an
animal or plant in a particular direction, the individuals are fewer and
less vigorous as they approach the extreme confines of the geographical
range of the species. But these stragglers are ready to multiply rapidly
on the slightest increase or diminution of heat that may be favorable
to them, just as particular insects increase during a hot summer, and
certain plants and animals gain ground after a series of congenial
seasons.</p>

<p>In almost every district, especially if it be mountainous, there are a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_699" id="Page_699">699</a></span>
variety of species the limits of whose habitations are conterminous, some
being unable to proceed farther without encountering too much heat,
others too much cold. Individuals, which are thus on the borders of the
regions proper to their respective species, are like the outposts of hostile
armies, ready to profit by every slight change of circumstances in their
favor, and to advance upon the ground occupied by their neighbors
and opponents.</p>

<p>The proximity of distinct climates produced by the inequalities of the
earth's surface, brings species possessing very different constitutions into
such immediate contact, that their naturalizations are very speedy whenever
opportunities of advancing present themselves. Many insects and
plants, for example, are common to low plains within the arctic circle,
and to lofty mountains in Scotland and other parts of Europe. If the
climate, therefore, of the polar regions were transferred to our own latitudes,
the species in question would immediately descend from these elevated
stations to overrun the low grounds. Invasions of this kind, attended
by the expulsion of the pre-occupants, are almost instantaneous,
because the change of temperature not only places the one species in a
more favorable position, but renders the others sickly and almost incapable
of defence.</p>

<p><i>These changes inconsistent with the theory of transmutation.</i>&mdash;Lamarck,
when speculating on the transmutation of species, supposed every modification
in organization and instinct to be brought about slowly and insensibly
in an indefinite lapse of ages. But he does not appear to have
sufficiently considered how much every alteration in the physical condition
of the habitable surface changes the relations of a great number of co-existing
species, and that some of these would be ready instantly to avail
themselves of the slightest change in their favor, and to multiply to the
injury of others. Even if we thought it possible that the palm or the
elephant, which now flourish in equatorial regions, could ever learn to
bear the variable seasons of our temperate zone, or the rigors of an
arctic winter, we might with no less confidence affirm, that they must
perish before they had time to become habituated to such new circumstances.
That they would be displaced by other species as often as the
climate varied, may be inferred from the data before explained respecting
the local extermination of species produced by the multiplication of
others.</p>

<p>Suppose the climate of the highest part of the woody zone of Etna to
be transferred to the sea-shore of the base of the mountain, no botanist
would anticipate that the olive, lemon-tree, and prickly pear (<i>Cactus
Opuntia</i>) would be able to contend with the oak and chestnut, which
would begin forthwith to descend to a lower level; or that these last
would be able to stand their ground against the pine, which would also,
in the space of a few years, begin to occupy a lower position. We might
form some kind of estimate of the time which might be required for the
migrations of these plants; whereas we have no data for concluding that
any number of thousands of years would be sufficient for one step in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_700" id="Page_700">700</a></span>
pretended metamorphosis of one species into another, possessing distinct
attributes and qualities.</p>

<p>This argument is applicable not merely to <i>climate</i>, but to any other
cause of mutation. However slowly a lake may be converted into a
marsh, or a marsh into a meadow, it is evident that before the lacustrine
plants can acquire the power of living in marshes, or the marsh-plants
of living in a less humid soil, other species, already existing in the region,
and fitted for these several stations, will intrude and keep possession of
the ground. So, if a tract of salt water becomes fresh by passing through
every intermediate degree of brackishness, still the marine mollusks will
never be permitted to be gradually metamorphosed into fluviatile species;
because long before any such transformation can take place by slow and
insensible degrees, other tribes, already formed to delight in brackish or
fresh water, will avail themselves of the change in the fluid, and will,
each in their turn, monopolize the space.</p>

<p>It is idle, therefore, to dispute about the abstract possibility of the
conversion of one species into another, when there are known causes so
much more active in their nature, which must always intervene and prevent
the actual accomplishment of such conversions. A faint image of
the certain doom of a species less fitted to struggle with some new condition
in a region which it previously inhabited, and where it has to contend
with a more vigorous species, is presented by the extirpation of savage
tribes of men by the advancing colony of some civilized nation. In
this case the contest is merely between two different <i>races</i>&mdash;two varieties,
moreover, of a species which exceeds all others in its aptitude to accommodate
its habits to the most extraordinary variations of circumstances.
Yet few future events are more certain than the speedy extermination of
the Indians of North America and the savages of New Holland in the
course of a few centuries, when these tribes will be remembered only in
poetry or history.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Concluding remarks.</i>&mdash;We often hear astonishment expressed at the
disappearance from the earth in times comparatively modern of many
small as well as large animals, the remains of which have been found in
a fossil state, under circumstances implying that neither any great geographical
revolution, nor the exterminating influence of man has intervened
to account for their extinction. But in all such cases we should
inquire whether we are sufficiently acquainted with the numerous and
complicated conditions on which the perpetuation of each species depends,
to entitle us to wonder if it should be suddenly cut off.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, when calling attention to the fact that the horse, megatherium,
megalonyx, and many contemporary Mammalia, had perished
in South America after that continent had acquired its present configuration,
and when, if we may judge by the Testacea, the climate very
nearly resembled the present, observes, "that in the living creation one
species is often extremely rare in a given region, while another of the
same genus and with closely allied habits is exceedingly common. A
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_701" id="Page_701">701</a></span>
zoologist familiar with such phenomena, if asked to explain them, usually
replies, that some slight difference in climate, food, or the number
of its enemies, must determine the relative strength of the two species
in question, although we may be unable to point out the precise manner
of the action of the check. We are, therefore, driven to the conclusion,
that causes generally quite inappreciable by us determine whether
a given species shall be abundant or scanty in numbers. Why,
then, should we feel astonishment if the rarity is occasionally carried a
step farther,&mdash;to extinction?"<a name="FNanchor_989" id="FNanchor_989"></a><a href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor">989</a></p>

<h4>CHAPTER XLIII.</h4>

<h6>EXTINCTION AND CREATION OF SPECIES.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Theory of the successive extinction of species consistent with a limited geographical
distribution&mdash;Opinions of botanists respecting the centres from which
plants have been diffused&mdash;Whether there are grounds for inferring that the
loss, from time to time, of certain animals and plants, is compensated by the
introduction of new species?&mdash;Whether any evidence of such new creations
could be expected within the historical era?&mdash;The question whether the existing
species have been created in succession must be decided by geological
monuments.</p></div>

<h5><i>Successive Extinction of Species consistent with their limited Geographical
Distribution.</i></h5>

<p>In the preceding chapters I have pointed out the strict dependence
of each species of animal and plant on certain physical conditions in
the state of the earth's surface, and on the number and attributes of
other organic beings inhabiting the same region. I have also endeavored
to show that all these conditions are in a state of continual
fluctuation, the igneous and aqueous agents remodelling, from time
to time, the physical geography of the globe, and the migrations of
species causing new relations to spring up successively between different
organic beings. I have deduced as a corollary, that the species existing
at any particular period, must, in the course of ages, become extinct
one after the other. "They must die out," to borrow an emphatical
expression from Buffon, "because Time fights against them."</p>

<p>If the views which I have taken are just, there will be no difficulty in
explaining why the habitations of so many species are now restrained
within exceedingly narrow limits. Every local revolution, such as
those contemplated in the preceding chapter, tends to circumscribe the
range of some species, while it enlarges that of others; and if we are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_702" id="Page_702">702</a></span>
led to infer that new species originate in one spot only, each must
require time to diffuse itself over a wide area. It will follow, therefore,
from the adoption of this hypothesis, that the recent origin of
some species, and the high antiquity of others, are equally consistent
with the general fact of their limited distribution; some being local,
because they have not existed long enough to admit of their wide
dissemination; others, because circumstances in the animate or inanimate
world have occurred to restrict the range which they may once
have obtained. As a general rule, however, species, common to many
distant provinces, or those now found to inhabit very distant parts of
the globe, are to be regarded as the most ancient. Numerically speaking,
they may not perhaps be largely represented, but their wide diffusion
shows that they have had a long time to spread themselves, and
have been able to survive many important revolutions in physical
geography.</p>

<p>After so much evidence has been brought to light by the geologist,
of land and sea having changed places in various regions since the
existing species were in being, we can feel no surprise that the zoologist
and botanist have hitherto found it difficult to refer the geographical
distribution of species to any clear and determinate principles, since
they have usually speculated on the phenomena, upon the assumption
that the physical geography of the globe had undergone no material
alteration since the introduction of the species now living. So long as
this assumption was made, the facts relating to the geography of plants
and animals appeared capricious in the extreme, and by many the subject
was pronounced to be so full of mystery and anomalies, that the
establishment of a satisfactory theory was hopeless.<a name="FNanchor_990" id="FNanchor_990"></a><a href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">990</a></p>

<p><i>Centres from which plants have been diffused.</i>&mdash;Some botanists conceived,
in accordance with the hypothesis of Wildenow, that mountains
were the centres of creation from which the plants now inhabiting large
continents have radiated; to which De Candolle and others, with much
reason, objected, that mountains, on the contrary, are often the barriers
between two provinces of distinct vegetation. The geologist who is
acquainted with the extensive modifications which the surface of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_703" id="Page_703">703</a></span>
earth has undergone in very recent geological epochs, may be able, perhaps,
to reconcile both these theories in their application to different
regions.</p>

<p>A lofty range of mountains, which is so ancient as to date from a
period when the species of animals and plants differed from those now
living, will naturally form a barrier between contiguous provinces; but a
chain which has been raised, in great part, within the epoch of existing
species, and around which new lands have arisen from the sea within
that period, will be a centre of peculiar vegetation.</p>

<p>"In France," observes De Candolle, "the Alps and Cevennes prevent
a great number of the plants of the south from spreading themselves to
the northward; but it has been remarked that some species have made
their way through the gorges of these chains, and are found on their
northern sides, principally in those places where they are lower and more
interrupted."<a name="FNanchor_991" id="FNanchor_991"></a><a href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">991</a> Now the chains here alluded to have probably been of
considerable height ever since the era when the existing vegetation began
to appear, and were it not for the deep fissures which divide them, they
might have caused much more abrupt terminations to the extension of
distinct assemblages of species.</p>

<p>Parts of the Italian peninsula, on the other hand, have gained a considerable
portion of their present height since a majority of the marine
species now inhabiting the Mediterranean, and probably, also, since the
terrestrial plants of the same region were in being. Large tracts of land
have been added, both on the Adriatic and Mediterranean side, to what
originally constituted a much narrower range of mountains, if not a chain
of islands running nearly north and south, like Corsica and Sardinia. It
may therefore be presumed that the Apennines have been a centre whence
species have diffused themselves over the contiguous <i>lower</i> and <i>newer</i>
regions. In this and all analogous situations, the doctrine of Wildenow,
that species have radiated from the mountains as from centres, may be
well founded.</p>

<h5><i>Introduction of New Species.</i></h5>

<p>If the reader should infer, from the facts laid before him in the preceding
chapters, that the successive extinction of animals and plants may
be part of the constant and regular course of nature, he will naturally
inquire whether there are any means provided for the repair of these
losses? Is it part of the economy of our system that the habitable globe
should, to a certain extent, become depopulated both in the ocean and
on the land; or that the variety of species should diminish until some
new era arrives when a new and extraordinary effort of creative energy
is to be displayed? Or is it possible that new species can be called into
being from time to time, and yet that so astonishing a phenomenon can
escape the observation of naturalists?</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_704" id="Page_704">704</a></span>
Humboldt has characterized these subjects as among the mysteries
which natural science cannot reach; and he observes that the investigation
of the origin of beings does not belong to zoological or botanical
geography. To geology, however, these topics do strictly appertain; and
this science is chiefly interested in inquiries into the state of the animate
creation as it now exists, with a view of pointing out its relations to antecedent
periods when its condition was different.</p>

<p>Before offering any hypothesis towards the solution of so difficult a
problem, let us consider what kind of evidence we ought to expect, in
the present state of science, of the first appearance of new animals or
plants, if we could imagine the successive creation of species to constitute,
like their gradual extinction, a regular part of the economy of nature.</p>

<p>In the first place it is obviously more easy to prove that a species,
once numerously represented in a given district, has ceased to be, than
that some other which did not pre-exist has made its appearance&mdash;assuming
always, for reasons before stated, that single stocks only of each
animal and plant are originally created, and that individuals of new
species do not suddenly start up in many different places at once.</p>

<p>So imperfect has the science of natural history remained down to our
own times, that, within the memory of persons now living, the numbers
of known animals and plants have been doubled, or even quadrupled, in
many classes. New and often conspicuous species are annually discovered
in parts of the old continent, long inhabited by the most civilized
nations. Conscious, therefore, of the limited extent of our information,
we always infer, when such discoveries are made, that the beings in
question had previously eluded our research; or had at least existed elsewhere,
and only migrated at a recent period into the territories where we
now find them. It is difficult, even in contemplation, to anticipate the
time when we shall be entitled to make any other hypothesis in regard
to all the marine tribes, and to by far the greater number of the terrestrial;&mdash;such
as birds, which possess such unlimited powers of migration;
insects, which, besides the variability of each species in number, are also
so capable of being diffused to vast distances; and cryptogamous plants,
to which, as to many other classes, both of the animal and vegetable
kingdom, similar observations are applicable.</p>

<p><i>What kind of evidence of new creations could be expected?</i>&mdash;What kind
of proofs, therefore, could we reasonably expect to find of the origin at a
particular period of a new species?</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be said in reply that, within the last two or three centuries,
some forest tree or new quadruped might have been observed to
appear suddenly in those parts, of England or France which had been
most thoroughly investigated;&mdash;that naturalists might have been able to
show that no such living being inhabited any other region of the globe,
and that there was no tradition of anything similar having before been
observed in the district where it had made its appearance.</p>

<p>Now, although this objection may seem plausible, yet its force will be
found to depend entirely on the rate of fluctuation which we suppose to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_705" id="Page_705">705</a></span>
prevail in the animate world, and on the proportion which such conspicuous
subjects of the animal and vegetable kingdoms bear to those which
are less known and escape our observation. There are, perhaps, more than
a million species of plants and animals, exclusive of the microscopic and
infusory animalcules, now inhabiting the terraqueous globe. The terrestrial
plants may amount, says De Candolle, to somewhere between 110,000
and 120,000;<a name="FNanchor_992" id="FNanchor_992"></a><a href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">992</a> but the data on which this conjecture is founded are considered
by many botanists to be vague and unsatisfactory. Sprengel only
enumerated, in 1827, about 31,000 known ph&aelig;nogamous, and 6000
cryptogamous plants; but that naturalist omitted many, perhaps 7000
ph&aelig;nogamous, and 1000 cryptogamous species. Mr. Lindley, in a letter
to the author in 1836, expressed his opinion that it would be rash to
speculate on the existence of more than 80,000 ph&aelig;nogamous, and 10,000
cryptogamous plants. "If we take," he says, in a letter to the author on
this subject, "37,000 as the number of published ph&aelig;nogamous species,
and then add, for the undiscovered species in Asia and New Holland,
15,000, in Africa 10,000, and in America 18,000, we have 80,000 species;
and if 7000 be the number of published cryptogamous plants, and
we allow 3000 for the undiscovered species (making 10,000), there would
then be, on the whole, 90,000 species." But since that period one catalogue,
as I learn from Dr. J. Hooker, contains a list of the names of 78,000
ph&aelig;nogamous plants which had been published before 1841.</p>

<p>It was supposed by Linn&aelig;us that there were four or five species of
insects in the world for each ph&aelig;nogamous plant: but if we may judge from
the relative proportion of the two classes in Great Britain, the number of
insects must be still greater; for the total number of British insects,
"according to the last census," is about 12,500;<a name="FNanchor_993" id="FNanchor_993"></a><a href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">993</a> whereas there are only
1500 ph&aelig;nogamous plants indigenous to our island. As the insects are
much more numerous in hot countries than in our temperate latitudes, it
seems difficult to avoid the conclusion that there are more than half a
million species in the world.</p>

<p>The number of known mammifers, when Temminck wrote, exceeded
800, and Mr. Waterhouse informs me that more than 1200 are now
(1850) ascertained to exist. Baron Cuvier estimated the amount of known
fishes at 6000; and Mr. G. Gray, in his "Genera of Birds," enumerates
8000 species. We have still to add the reptiles, and all the invertebrated
animals, exclusive of insects. It remains, in a great degree, mere matter
of conjecture what proportion the aquatic tribes may bear to the denizens
of the land; but the habitable surface beneath the waters can hardly be
estimated at less than double that of the continents and islands, even
admitting that a very considerable area is destitute of life, in consequence
of great depth, cold, darkness, and other circumstances. In the late polar
expedition it was found that, in some regions, as in Baffin's Bay, there
were marine animals inhabiting the bottom at great depths, where the
temperature of the water was below the freezing point. That there is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_706" id="Page_706">706</a></span>
life at much greater profundities in warmer regions may be confidently
inferred.</p>

<p>The ocean teems with life&mdash;the class of <i>Polyps</i> alone are conjectured
by Lamarck to be as strong in individuals as insects. Every tropical reef
is described as covered with Corals and Sponges, and swarming with
Crustacea, Echini, and Testacea; while almost every tide-washed rock in
the world is carpeted with Fuci, and supports some Corallines, Actini&aelig;,
and Mollusca. There are innumerable forms in the seas of the warmer
zones, which have scarcely begun to attract the attention of the naturalist;
and there are parasitic animals without number, three or four of which
are sometimes appropriated to one genus, as to the whale (<i>Bal&aelig;na</i>), for
example. Even though we concede, therefore, that the geographical range
of marine species is more extensive in general than that of the terrestrial (the
temperature of the sea being more uniform, and the land impeding less
the migrations of the oceanic than the ocean those of the terrestrial species),
yet it seems probable that the aquatic tribes far exceed in number
the inhabitants of the land.</p>

<p>Without insisting on this point, it may be safe to assume, that, exclusive
of microscopic beings, there are between one and two millions of
species now inhabiting the terraqueous globe; so that if only one of these
were to become extinct annually, and one new one were to be every year
called into being, much more than a million of years might be required
to bring about a complete revolution in organic life.</p>

<p>I am not hazarding at present any hypothesis as to the probable rate
of change; but none will deny that when the <i>annual</i> birth and the <i>annual</i>
death of one species on the globe is proposed as a mere speculation, this
at least is to imagine no slight degree of instability in the animate creation.
If we divide the surface of the earth into twenty regions of equal
area, one of these might comprehend a space of land and water about
equal in dimensions to Europe, and might contain a twentieth part of the
million of species which may be assumed to exist in the animal kingdom.
In this region one species only would, according to the rate of mortality
before assumed, perish in twenty years, or only five out of fifty thousand
in the course of a century. But as a considerable proportion of the whole
would belong to the aquatic classes, with which we have a very imperfect
acquaintance, we must exclude them from our consideration; and if they
constitute half of the entire number, then one species only might be lost
in forty years among the terrestrial tribes. Now the Mammalia, whether
terrestrial or aquatic, bear so small a proportion to other classes of animals,
forming less, perhaps, than one thousandth part of the whole, that
if the longevity of species in the different orders were equal, a vast period
must elapse before it would come to the turn of this conspicuous class to
lose one of their number. If one species only of the whole animal kingdom
died out in forty years, no more than one mammifer might disappear
in 40,000 years in a region of the dimensions of Europe.</p>

<p>It is easy, therefore, to see, that in a small portion of such an area,
in countries, for example, of the size of England and France, periods of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_707" id="Page_707">707</a></span>
much greater duration must elapse before it would be possible to authenticate
the first appearance of one of the larger plants and animals, assuming
the annual birth and death of one species to be the rate of vicissitude
in the animate creation throughout the world.</p>

<p>The observations of naturalists upon living species may, in the course
of future centuries, accumulate positive data, from which an insight into
the laws which govern this part of our terrestrial system may be derived;
but, in the present deficiency of historical records, we have traced up the
subject to that point where geological monuments alone are capable of
leading us on to the discovery of ulterior truths. To these, therefore, we
must appeal, carefully examining the strata of recent formation wherein
the remains of <i>living</i> species, both animal and vegetable, are known to
occur. We must study these strata in strict reference to their chronological
order, as deduced from their superposition, and other relations. From
these sources we may learn which of the species, now our contemporaries,
have survived the greatest revolutions of the earth's surface; which of
them have co-existed with the greatest number of animals and plants
now extinct; and which have made their appearance only when the animate
world had nearly attained its present condition.</p>

<p>From such data we may be enabled to infer, whether species have been
called into existence in succession, or all at one period; whether singly,
or by groups simultaneously; whether the antiquity of man be as high
as that of any of the inferior beings which now share the planet
with him, or whether the human species is one of the most recent of the
whole.</p>

<p>To some of these questions we can even now return a satisfactory
answer; and with regard to the rest, we have some data to guide conjecture,
and to enable us to speculate with advantage: but in order to be
fully qualified to enter upon such discussions the reader must study the
ample body of materials amassed by the industry of modern geologists.</p>

<h4>CHAPTER XLIV.</h4>

<h6>EFFECTS PRODUCED BY THE POWERS OF VITALITY ON THE STATE
OF THE EARTH'S SURFACE.</h6>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Modifications in physical geography caused by organic beings&mdash;Why the vegetable
soil does not augment in thickness&mdash;The theory, that vegetation is an
antagonist power counterbalancing the degradation caused by running water
untenable&mdash;Conservative influence of vegetation&mdash;Rain diminished by felling
of forests&mdash;Distribution of American forests dependent on direction of predominant
winds&mdash;Influence of man in modifying the physical geography of
the globe.</p></div>

<p>The second branch of our inquiry, respecting changes of the organic
world, relates to the processes by which the remains of animals and
plants become fossil, or, to speak still more generally, to all the effects
produced by the powers of vitality on the surface and shell of the
earth.</p>

<p>Before entering on the principal division of this subject, the imbedding
and preservation of animal and vegetable remains, I shall offer a few remarks
on the superficial modifications caused directly by the agency of
organic beings, as when the growth of certain plants covers the slope of
a mountain with peat, or converts a swamp into dry land; or when vegetation
prevents the soil, in certain localities, from being washed away by
running water.</p>

<p>In considering alterations of this kind, brought about in the physical
geography of particular tracts, we are too apt to think exclusively of that
part of the earth's surface which has emerged from beneath the waters,
and with which alone, as terrestrial beings, we are familiar. Here the
direct power of animals and plants to cause any important variation is,
of necessity, very limited, except in checking the progress of that decay
of which the land is the chief theatre. But if we extend our views, and
instead of contemplating the dry land, consider that larger portion which
is assigned to the aquatic tribes, we discover the great influence of the
living creation, in imparting varieties of conformation to the solid exterior
which the agency of inanimate causes alone could not produce.</p>

<p>Thus, when timber is floated into the sea, it is often drifted to vast
distances, and subsides in spots where there might have been no deposit,
at that time and place, if the earth had not been tenanted by living
beings. If, therefore, in the course of ages, a hill of wood, or lignite,
be thus formed in the subaqueous regions, a change in the submarine
geography may be said to have resulted from the action of organic powers.
So in regard to the growth of coral reefs; it is probable that a large
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_709" id="Page_709">709</a></span>
portion of the matter of which they are composed is supplied by mineral
springs, which often rise up at the bottom of the sea, and which, on land,
abound throughout volcanic regions hundreds of leagues in extent. The
matter thus constantly given out could not go on accumulating for ever
in the waters, but would be precipitated in the abysses of the sea, even
if there were no polyps and testacea; but these animals arrest and secrete
the carbonate of lime on the summits of submarine mountains, and form
reefs many hundred feet in thickness, and hundreds of miles in length,
where, but for them, none might ever have existed.</p>

<p><i>Why the vegetable soil does not augment in thickness.</i>&mdash;If no such
voluminous masses are formed on the land, it is not from the want of
solid matter in the structure of terrestrial animals and plants; but merely
because, as I have so often stated, the continents are those parts of the
globe where accessions of matter can scarcely ever take place&mdash;where,
on the contrary, the most solid parts already formed are, each in their
turn, exposed to gradual degradation. The quantity of timber and
vegetable matter which grows in a tropical forest in the course of a
century is enormous, and multitudes of animal skeletons are scattered
there during the same period, besides innumerable land shells and other
organic substances. The aggregate of these materials, therefore, might
constitute a mass greater in volume than that which is produced in any
coral-reef during the same lapse of years; but, although this process
should continue on the land for ever, no mountains of wood or bone
would be seen stretching far and wide over the country, or pushing out
bold promontories into the sea. The whole solid mass is either devoured
by animals, or decomposes, as does a portion of the rock and soil on
which the animals and plants are supported.</p>

<p>The waste of the strata themselves, accompanied by the decomposition
of their organic remains, and the setting free of their alkaline ingredients,
is one source from whence running water and the atmosphere may derive
the materials which are absorbed by the roots and leaves of plants.
Another source is the passage into a gaseous form of even the hardest
parts of animals and plants which die and putrefy in the air, where they
are soon resolved into the elements of which they are composed: and
while a portion of these constituents is volatilized, the rest is taken up
by rain-water, and sinks into the earth, or flows towards the sea; so that
they enter again and again into the composition of different organic
beings.</p>

<p>The principal elements found in plants are hydrogen, carbon, and
oxygen; so that water and the atmosphere contain all of them, either
in their own composition or in solution.<a name="FNanchor_994" id="FNanchor_994"></a><a href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">994</a> The constant supply of
these elements is maintained not only by the putrefaction of animal
and vegetable substances, and the decay of rocks, but also by the
copious evolution of carbonic acid and other gases from volcanoes and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_710" id="Page_710">710</a></span>
mineral springs, and by the effects of ordinary evaporation, whereby
aqueous vapors are made to rise from the ocean, and to circulate round
the globe.</p>

<p>It is well known, that when two gases of different specific gravity are
brought into contact, even though the heavier be the lowermost, they soon
become uniformly diffused by mutual absorption through the whole space
which they occupy. By virtue of this law, the heavy carbonic acid finds
its way upwards through the lighter air of the atmosphere, and conveys
nourishment to the lichen which covers the mountain top.</p>

<p>If the quantity of food consumed by terrestrial animals, and the
elements imbibed by the roots and leaves of plants, were derived entirely
from that supply of hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, and other
elements, given out into the atmosphere and the waters by the putrescence
of organic substances, then we might imagine that the vegetable
mould would, after a series of years, neither gain nor lose a single particle
by the action of organic beings; and this conclusion is not far from the
truth; but the operation which renovates the vegetable and animal mould
is by no means so simple as that here supposed. Thousands of carcases
of terrestrial animals are floated down, every century, into the sea; and,
together with forests of drift-timber, are imbedded in subaqueous deposits,
where their elements are imprisoned in solid strata, and may there remain
locked up throughout whole geological epochs before they again become
subservient to the purposes of life.</p>

<p>On the other hand, fresh supplies are derived by the atmosphere and
by running water, as before stated, from the disintegration of rocks and
their organic contents, and through the agency of mineral springs from the
interior of the earth, from whence all the elements before mentioned, which
enter principally into the composition of animals and vegetables, are continually
evolved. Even nitrogen is found, by chemists, to be contained
very generally in the waters of mineral springs.</p>

<p><i>Vegetation not an antagonist power counterbalancing the action of
running water.</i>&mdash;If we suppose that the copious supply from the nether
regions, by springs and volcanic vents, of carbonic acid and other gases,
together with the decomposition of rocks, may be just sufficient to counterbalance
that loss of matter which, having already served for the nourishment
of animals and plants, is annually carried down in organized
forms, and buried in subaqueous strata, we concede the utmost that is
consistent with probability. An opinion, however, has been expressed,
that the processes of vegetable life, by absorbing various gases from the
atmosphere, cause so large a mass of solid matter to accumulate on
the surface of the land, that this mass alone may constitute a great counterpoise
to all the matter transported to lower levels by the aqueous
agents of decay. "Torrents and rivers," it is said&mdash;"the waves of the
sea and marine currents&mdash;act upon lines only; but the power of vegetation
to absorb the elastic and non-elastic fluids circulating round the
earth, extends over the whole surface of the continents. By the silent
but universal action of this great antagonist power, the spoliation and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_711" id="Page_711">711</a></span>
waste caused by running water on the land, and by the movements of the
ocean, are neutralized, and even counterbalanced."<a name="FNanchor_995" id="FNanchor_995"></a><a href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor">995</a></p>

<p>In opposition to these views, I conceive that we shall form a juster
estimate of the influence of vegetation, if we consider it as being in a
slight degree conservative, and capable of retarding the waste of land,
but not of acting as an antagonist power. The vegetable mould is
seldom more than a few feet in thickness, and frequently does not exceed
a few inches; and we by no means find that its volume is more considerable
on those parts of our continents which we can prove, by geological
data, to have been elevated at more ancient periods, and where,
consequently, there has been the greatest time for the accumulation of
vegetable matter, produced throughout successive zoological epochs. On
the contrary, these higher and older regions are more frequently denuded,
so as to expose the bare rock to the action of the sun and air.</p>

<p>We find in the torrid zone, where the growth of plants is most rank
and luxurious, that accessions of matter due to their agency are by no
means the most conspicuous. Indeed it is in these latitudes, where the
vegetation is most active, that, for reasons to be explained in the next
chapter, even those superficial peat mosses are unknown which cover a
large area in some parts of our temperate zone. If the operation of
animal and vegetable life could restore to the general surface of the
continents a portion of the elements of those disintegrated rocks of
which such enormous masses are swept down annually into the sea, the
effects would long ere this have constituted one of the most striking
features in the structure and composition of our continents. All the
great steppes and table-lands of the world, where the action of running
water is feeble, would have become the grand repositories of organic
matter, accumulated without that intermixture of earthy sediment
which so generally characterizes the subaqueous strata.</p>

<p>I have already stated that, in the known operation of the <i>igneous</i> causes,
a real antagonist power is found, which may counterbalance the levelling
action of running water (p. 563); and there seems no good reason
for presuming that the upheaving and depressing force of earthquakes,
together with the ejection of matter by volcanoes, may not be fully adequate
to restore that inequality of the surface which rivers and the waves
and currents of the ocean annually tend to lessen. If a counterpoise be
derived from this source, the quantity and elevation of land above the
sea may for ever remain the same, in spite of the action of the aqueous
causes, which, if thus counteracted, may never be able to reduce the
surface of the earth more nearly to a state of equilibrium than that which
it has now attained; and, on the other hand, the force of the aqueous
agents themselves might thus continue for ever unimpaired.</p>

<p><i>Conservative influence of vegetation.</i>&mdash;If, then, vegetation cannot act
as an antagonist power amid the mighty agents of change which are
always modifying the surface of the globe, let us next inquire how far
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_712" id="Page_712">712</a></span>
its influence is conservative,&mdash;how far it may retard the levelling effects
of running water, which it cannot oppose, much less counterbalance.</p>

<p>It is well known that a covering of herbage and shrubs may protect a
loose soil from being carried away by rain, or even by the ordinary
action of a river, and may prevent hills of loose sand from being blown
away by the wind; for the roots bind together the separate particles
into a firm mass, and the leaves intercept the rain-water, so that it dries
up gradually, instead of flowing off in a mass and with great velocity.
The old Italian hydrographers make frequent mention of the increased
degradation which has followed the clearing away of natural woods in
several parts of Italy. A remarkable example was afforded in the
Upper Val d' Arno, in Tuscany, on the removal of the woods clothing
the steep declivities of the hills by which that valley is bounded.
When the ancient forest laws were abolished by the Grand Duke Joseph,
during the last century, a considerable tract of surface in the Cassentina
(the Clausentinium of the Romans) was denuded, and immediately the
quantity of sand and soil washed down into the Arno increased enormously.
Frisi, alluding to such occurrences, observes, that as soon as
the bushes and plants were removed, the waters flowed off more rapidly,
and, in the manner of floods, swept away the vegetable soil.<a name="FNanchor_996" id="FNanchor_996"></a><a href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a></p>

<p>This effect of vegetation is of high interest to the geologist, when he
is considering the formation of those valleys which have been principally
due to the action of rivers. The spaces intervening between valleys,
whether they be flat or ridgy, when covered with vegetation, may
scarcely undergo the slightest waste, as the surface may be protected by
the green sward of grass; and this may be renewed, in the manner
before described, from elements derived from rain-water and the atmosphere.
Hence, while the river is continually bearing down matter in
the alluvial plain, and undermining the cliffs on each side of every valley,
the height of the intervening rising grounds may remain stationary.</p>

<p>In this manner, a cone of loose scori&aelig;, sand, and ashes, such as Monte
Nuovo, may, when it has once become densely clothed with herbage
and shrubs, suffer scarcely any further dilapidation; and the perfect
state of the cones of hundreds of extinct volcanoes in France, the Neapolitan
territory, Sicily, and elsewhere, may prove nothing whatever,
either as to their relative or absolute antiquity. We may be enabled
to infer, from the integrity of such conical hills of incoherent materials,
that no flood can have passed over the countries where they are situated,
since their formation; but the atmospheric action alone, in spots where
there happen to be no torrents, and where the surface was clothed with
vegetation, could scarcely in any lapse of ages have destroyed them.</p>

<p>During a tour in Spain, in 1830, I was surprised to see a district of
gently undulating ground in Catalonia, consisting of red and gray sandstone,
and in some parts of red marl, almost entirely denuded of herbage;
while the roots of the pines, holm oaks, and some other trees, were half
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_713" id="Page_713">713</a></span>
exposed, as if the soil had been washed away by a flood. Such is the
state of the forests, for example, between Oristo and Vich, and near San
Lorenzo. But, being overtaken by a violent thunder-storm, in the month
of August, I saw the whole surface, even the highest levels of some flat-topped
hills, streaming with mud, while on every declivity the devastation
of torrents was terrific. The peculiarities in the physiognomy of
the district were at once explained; and I was taught that, in speculating
on the greater effects which the direct action of rain may once have produced
on the surface of certain parts of England, we need not revert to
periods when the heat of the climate was <i>tropical</i>.</p>

<p>In the torrid zone the degradation of land is generally more rapid;
but the waste is by no means proportioned to the superior quantity of
rain or the suddenness of its fall, the transporting power of water being
counteracted by a greater luxuriance of vegetation. A geologist who is
no stranger to tropical countries observes, that the softer rocks would
speedily be washed away in such regions, if the numerous roots of plants
were not matted together in such a manner as to produce considerable
resistance to the destructive power of the rains. The parasitical and
creeping plants also entwine in every possible direction, so as to render
the forests nearly impervious, and the trees possess forms and leaves best
calculated to shoot off the heavy rains; which, when they have thus
been broken in their fall, are quickly absorbed by the ground beneath,
or, when thrown into the drainage depressions, give rise to furious
torrents.<a name="FNanchor_997" id="FNanchor_997"></a><a href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a></p>

<h5><i>Influence of Man in modifying the Physical Geography of the
Globe.</i></h5>

<p>Before concluding this chapter, I shall offer a few observations on the
influence of man in modifying the physical geography of the globe; for
we must class his agency among the powers of organic nature.</p>

<p><i>Felling of forests.</i>&mdash;The felling of forests has been attended, in many
countries, by a diminution of rain, as in Barbadoes and Jamaica.<a name="FNanchor_998" id="FNanchor_998"></a><a href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor">998</a> For
in tropical countries, where the quantity of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere
is great, but where, on the other hand, the direct rays of the sun
are most powerful, any impediment to the free circulation of air, or any
screen which shades the earth from the solar rays, becomes a source of
humidity; and wherever dampness and cold have begun to be generated
by such causes, the condensation of vapor continues. The leaves, moreover,
of all plants are alembics, and some of those in the torrid zone have
the remarkable property of distilling water, thus contributing to prevent
the earth from becoming parched up.</p>

<p><i>Distribution of the American forests.</i>&mdash;There can be no doubt then,
that the state of the climate, especially the humidity of the atmosphere,
influences vegetation, and that, in its turn, vegetation re-acts upon the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_714" id="Page_714">714</a></span>
climate: but some writers seem to have attributed too much importance
to the influence of forests, particularly those of America, as if they were
the primary cause of the moisture of the climate.</p>

<p>The theory of a modern author on this subject "that forests exist in
those parts of America only where the predominant winds carry with them a
considerable quantity of moisture from the ocean," seems far more rational.
In all countries, he says, "having a summer heat exceeding 70&deg;, the
presence or absence of natural woods, and their greater or less luxuriance,
may be taken as a measure of the amount of humidity, and of the fertility
of the soil. Short and heavy rains in a warm country will produce
grass, which, having its roots near to the surface, springs up in a few days,
and withers when the moisture is exhausted; but transitory rains, however
heavy, will not nourish trees; because, after the surface is saturated,
the remainder of the water runs off, and the moisture lodged in the soil
neither sinks deep enough, nor is in sufficient quantity, to furnish the
giants of the forests with the necessary sustenance. It may be assumed
that twenty inches of rain falling moderately or at intervals, will leave a
greater permanent supply in the soil than forty inches falling, as it sometimes
does in the torrid zone, in as many hours."<a name="FNanchor_999" id="FNanchor_999"></a><a href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor">999</a></p>

<p>"In all regions," he continues, "where ranges of mountains intercept
the course of the constant or predominant winds, the country on the
windward side of the mountains will be moist, and that on the leeward
dry; and hence parched deserts will generally be found on the west side
of countries within the tropics, and on the east side of those beyond
them, the prevailing winds in these cases being generally in opposite directions.
On this principle, the position of forests in North and South
America may be explained. Thus, for example, in the region within the
thirtieth parallel, the moisture swept up by the trade-wind from the Atlantic
is precipitated in part upon the mountains of Brazil, which are but
low, and so distributed as to extend far into the interior. The portion
which remains is borne westward, and, losing a little as it proceeds, is
at length arrested by the Andes, where it falls down in showers on their
summits. The a&euml;rial current, now deprived of all the humidity with
which it can part, arrives in a state of complete exsiccation at Peru, where
consequently no rain falls. But in the region of America, beyond the
thirtieth parallel, the Andes serve as a screen to intercept the moisture
brought by the prevailing winds from the Pacific Ocean: rains are copious
on their summits, and in Chili on their <i>western</i> declivities; but none
falls on the plains to the <i>eastward</i>, except occasionally when the wind
blows from the Atlantic."<a name="FNanchor_1000" id="FNanchor_1000"></a><a href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor">1000</a></p>

<p>I have been more particular in explaining these views, because they
appear to place in a true light the dependence of vegetation on climate,
the humidity being increased, and more uniformly diffused throughout
the year, by the gradual spreading of wood.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_715" id="Page_715">715</a></span>
It has been affirmed, that formerly, when France and England were
covered with wood, Europe was much colder than at present; that the
winters in Italy were longer, and that the Seine, and many other rivers,
froze more regularly every winter than now. M. Arago, in an essay on
this subject, has endeavored to show, by tables of observations on the
congelation of the Rhine, Danube, Rhone, Po, Seine, and other rivers, at
different periods, that there is no reason to believe the cold to have been
in general more intense in ancient times.<a name="FNanchor_1001" id="FNanchor_1001"></a><a href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor">1001</a> He admits, however, that the
climate of Tuscany has been so far modified, by the removal of wood, as
that the winters are less cold; but the summers also, he contends, are
less hot than of old; and the summers, according to him, were formerly
hotter in France than in our own times. His evidence is derived chiefly
from documents showing that wine was made three centuries ago in
the Vivarais and several other provinces, at an earlier season, at greater
elevations, and in higher latitudes, than are now found suitable to the vine.</p>

<p>There seems little doubt that in the United States of North America
the rapid <i>clearing</i> of the country has rendered the winters less severe and
the summers less hot; in other words, the extreme temperatures of
January and July have been observed from year to year to approach
somewhat nearer to each other. Whether in this case, or in France, the
<i>mean</i> temperature has been raised, seems by no means as yet decided;
but there is no doubt that the climate has become, as Buffon would have
said, "less excessive."</p>

<p>I have before shown, when treating of the excavation of new estuaries
in Holland by inroads of the ocean, as also of the changes on our own
coasts, that although the conversion of sea into land by artificial labors
may be great, yet it must always be in subordination to the power of the
tides and currents, or to the great movements which alter the relative
level of the land and sea, (Chap. XX.) If, in addition to the assistance
obtained by parliamentary grants for defending Dunwich from the waves,
all the resources of Europe had been directed to the same end, the existence
of that port might perhaps have been prolonged for several centuries
(p. 310.) But in the mean time, the current would have continued to
sweep away portions from the adjoining cliffs on each side, giving to the
whole line of coast its present form, until at length the town, projecting as
a narrow promontory, must have become exposed to the irresistible fury
of the waves.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to observe, that the control which man can
obtain over the igneous agents is less even than that which he may exert
over the aqueous. He cannot modify the upheaving or depressing force
of earthquakes, or the periods or degree of violence of volcanic eruptions;
and on these causes the inequalities of the earth's surface, and, consequently,
the shape of the sea and land, appear mainly to depend. The
utmost that man can hope to effect in this respect is occasionally to
divert the course of a lava-stream, and to prevent the burning matter, for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_716" id="Page_716">716</a></span>
a season, from overwhelming a city, or some other of the proudest works
of human industry.</p>

<p>If all the nations of the earth should attempt to quarry away the lava
which flowed during one eruption from the Icelandic volcanoes in 1783,
and the two following years, and should attempt to consign it to the
deepest abysses of the ocean, they might toil for thousands of years and
not accomplish their task. Yet the matter borne down to the sea by two
great rivers, the Ganges and Burrampooter, in each quarter of a century,
probably equals in weight and volume the mass of Icelandic lava produced
by that great eruption (p. 282). So insignificant is the aggregate
force exerted by man, when contrasted with the ordinary operations of
aqueous or igneous agents in the natural world.</p>

<p>No application, perhaps, of human skill and labor tends so greatly to
vary the state of the habitable surface, as that employed in the drainage
of lakes and marshes, since not only the <i>stations</i> of many animals and
plants, but the general climate of a district, may thus be modified. It is
also a kind of alteration to which it is difficult to find anything analogous
in the agency of inferior beings; for we ought always, before we decide
that any part of the influence of man is novel and anomalous, carefully to
consider the powers of all other animated agents which may be limited
or superseded by him.<a name="FNanchor_1002" id="FNanchor_1002"></a><a href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a> Many who have reasoned on these subjects seem
to have forgotten that the human race often succeeds to the discharge of
functions previously fulfilled by other species. Suppose the growth of some
of the larger terrestrial plants, or, in other words, the extent of forest, to
be diminished by man, and the climate to be thereby modified, it does
not follow that this kind of innovation is unprecedented. It is a change
in the state of vegetation, and such may often have been the result of
the appearance of new species upon the earth. The multiplication, for
example, of certain insects in parts of Germany, during the last century,
destroyed more trees than man, perhaps, could have felled during an
equal period.</p>

<p>It would be rash, however, to affirm that the power of man to modify
the surface may not differ in kind or degree from that of other living
beings; although the problem is certainly more complex than many
who have speculated on such topics have imagined. If land be raised
from the sea, the greatest alteration in its physical condition, which
could ever arise from the influence of organic beings, would probably
be produced by the first immigration of terrestrial plants, whereby
the new tract would become covered with vegetation. The change
next in importance would seem to be when animals first enter, and
modify the proportionate numbers of certain species of plants. If there
be any anomaly in the intervention of man, in farther varying the relative
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_717" id="Page_717">717</a></span>
numbers in the vegetable kingdom, it may not so much consist in
the kind or absolute quantity of alteration, as in the circumstance that
a <i>single species</i>, in this case, would exert, by its superior power and universal
distribution, an influence equal to that of hundreds of other terrestrial
animals.</p>

<p>If we inquire whether man, by his direct power, or by the changes
which he may give rise to indirectly, tends, upon the whole, to lessen or
increase the inequalities of the earth's surface, we shall incline, perhaps,
to the opinion that he is a levelling agent. In mining operations he
conveys upwards a certain quantity of materials from the bowels of the
earth; but, on the other hand, much rock is taken annually from the
land, in the shape of ballast, and afterwards thrown into the sea, and
by this means, in spite of prohibitory laws, many harbors, in various
parts of the world, have been blocked up. We rarely transport heavy
materials to higher levels, and our pyramids and cities are chiefly constructed
of stone brought down from more elevated situations. By
ploughing up thousands of square miles, and exposing a surface for
part of the year to the action of the elements, we assist the abrading
force of rain, and diminish the conservative effects of vegetation.</p>

<p><i>Division of the subject.</i>&mdash;The next subject of inquiry is the mode in
which the remains of animals and plants become fossil, or are buried
in the earth by natural causes. M. Constant Prevost has observed,
that the effects of geological causes are divisible into two great classes;
those produced during the submersion of land beneath the waters,
and those which take place after its emersion. Agreeably to this classification,
I shall consider, first, in what manner animal and vegetable
remains become included and preserved in deposits on emerged land, or
that part of the surface which is not <i>permanently</i> covered by water,
whether of seas or lakes; secondly, the manner in which organic remains
become imbedded in subaqueous deposits.</p>

<p>Under the first division, I shall treat of the following topics:&mdash;1st, the
growth of peat, and the preservation of vegetable and animal remains
therein;&mdash;2dly, the burying of organic remains in blown sand;&mdash;3dly,
of the same in the ejections and alluviums of volcanoes;&mdash;4thly, in
alluviums generally, and in the ruins of landslips;&mdash;5thly, in the mud
and stalagmite of caves and fissures.</p>

<h5><i>Growth of Peat, and Preservation of Vegetable and Animal Remains
therein.</i></h5>

<p>The generation of peat, when not completely under water, is confined
to moist situations, where the temperature is low, and where vegetables
may decompose without putrefying. It may consist of any of the
numerous plants which are capable of growing in such <i>stations</i>; but a
species of moss (<i>Sphagnum</i>) constitutes a considerable part of the peat
found in marshes of the north of Europe; this plant having the property
of throwing up new shoots in its upper part, while its lower
extremities are decaying.<a name="FNanchor_1003" id="FNanchor_1003"></a><a href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a> Reeds, rushes, and other aquatic plants
may usually be traced in peat; and their organization is often so entire
that there is no difficulty in discriminating the distinct species.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_719" id="Page_719">719</a></span>
<i>Analysis of peat.</i>&mdash;In general, says Sir H. Davy, one hundred parts
of dry peat contain from sixty to ninety-nine parts of matter destructible
by fire; and the residuum consists of earths usually of the same
kind as the substratum of clay, marl, gravel, or rock, on which they are
found, together with oxide of iron. "The peat of the chalk counties
of England," observes the same writer, "contains much gypsum: but I
have found very little in any specimens from Ireland or Scotland, and
in general these peats contain very little saline matter."<a name="FNanchor_1004" id="FNanchor_1004"></a><a href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor">1004</a> From the
researches of Dr. MacCulloch, it appears that peat is intermediate
between simple vegetable matter and lignite, the conversion of peat to
lignite being gradual, and being brought about by a prolonged action
of water.<a name="FNanchor_1005" id="FNanchor_1005"></a><a href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor">1005</a></p>

<p><i>Peat abundant in cold and humid climates.</i>&mdash;Peat is sometimes
formed on a declivity in mountainous regions, where there is much
moisture; but in such situations it rarely, if ever, exceeds four feet in
thickness. In bogs, and in low grounds into which alluvial peat is
drifted, it is found forty feet thick, and upwards; but in such cases it
generally owes one half of its volume to the water which it contains.
It has seldom, if ever, been discovered within the tropics; and it rarely
occurs in the valleys, even in the south of France and Spain. It
abounds more and more, in proportion as we advance farther from the
equator, and becomes not only more frequent but more inflammable in
northern latitudes.<a name="FNanchor_1006" id="FNanchor_1006"></a><a href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor">1006</a></p>

<p>The same phenomenon is repeated in the southern hemisphere. No
peat is found in Brazil, nor even in the swampy parts of the country
drained by the La Plata on the east side of South America, or in the
island of Chiloe on the west; yet when we reach the 45th degree of
latitude and examine the Chonos Archipelago or the Falkland Islands,
and Tierra del Fuego, we meet with an abundant growth of this substance.
Almost all plants contribute here by their decay to the production
of peat, even the grasses; but it is a singular fact, says Mr.
Darwin, as contrasted with what occurs in Europe, that no kind of
moss enters into the composition of the South American peat, which
is formed by many plants, but chiefly by that called by Brown <i>Astelia
pumila</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1007" id="FNanchor_1007"></a><a href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor">1007</a></p>

<p>I learn from Dr. Forchhammer (1849) that water charged with vegetable
matter in solution does not throw down a deposit of peat in
countries where the mean temperature of the year is above 43&deg; or 44&deg;
Fahrenheit. Frost causes the precipitation of such peaty matter, but
in warm climates the attraction of the carbon for the oxygen of the air
mechanically mixed with the water increases with the increasing temperature,
and the dissolved vegetable matter or humic acid (which is
organic matter in a progressive state of decomposition) being converted
into carbonic acid, rises and is absorbed into the atmosphere, and thus
disappears.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_720" id="Page_720">720</a></span>
<i>Extent of surface covered by peat.</i>&mdash;There is a vast extent of surface
in Europe covered with peat, which, in Ireland, is said to extend over a
tenth of the whole island. One of the mosses on the Shannon is
described as being fifty miles long, by two or three broad; and the great
marsh of Montoire, near the mouth of the Loire, is mentioned, by
Blavier, as being more than fifty leagues in circumference. It is a
curious and well-ascertained fact, that many of these mosses of the north
of Europe occupy the place of forests of pine and oak, which have, many
of them, disappeared within the historical era. Such changes are
brought about by the fall of trees and the stagnation of water, caused
by their trunks and branches obstructing the free drainage of the
atmospheric waters, and giving rise to a marsh. In a warm climate,
such decayed timber would immediately be removed by insects, or by
putrefaction; but, in the cold temperature now prevailing in our
latitudes, many examples are recorded of marshes originating in this
source. Thus, in Mar forest, in Aberdeenshire, large trunks of Scotch
fir, which had fallen from age and decay, were soon immured in peat,
formed partly out of their perishing leaves and branches, and in part
from the growth of other plants. We also learn, that the overthrow of
a forest by a storm, about the middle of the seventeenth century, gave
rise to a peat-moss near Lochbroom, in Ross-shire, where, in less than
half a century after the fall of the trees, the inhabitants dug peat.<a name="FNanchor_1008" id="FNanchor_1008"></a><a href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor">1008</a> Dr.
Walker mentions a similar change, when, in the year 1756, the whole
wood of Drumlaurig in Dumfries-shire was overset by the wind. Such
events explain the occurrence, both in Britain and on the Continent, of
mosses where the trees are all broken within two or three feet of the
original surface, and where their trunks all lie in the same direction.<a name="FNanchor_1009" id="FNanchor_1009"></a><a href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor">1009</a></p>

<p>It may however be suggested in these cases, that the soil had become
exhausted for trees, and that, on the principle of that natural rotation
which prevails in the vegetable world, one set of plants died out and
another succeeded. It is certainly a remarkable fact that in the
Danish islands, and in Jutland and Holstein, fir wood of various species,
especially Scotch fir, is found at the bottom of the peat-mosses, although
it is well ascertained that for the last five centuries no Conifer&aelig; have
grown wild in these countries; the coniferous trees which now flourish
there having been all planted towards the close of the last century.</p>

<p>Nothing is more common than the occurrence of buried trees at the
bottom of the Irish peat-mosses, as also in most of those of England,
France, and Holland; and they have been so often observed with parts
of their trunks standing erect, and with their roots fixed to the subsoil,
that no doubt can be entertained of their having generally grown on
the spot. They consist, for the most part, of the fir, the oak, and the
birch: where the subsoil is clay, the remains of oak are the most abundant;
where sand is the substratum, fir prevails. In the marsh of
Curragh, in the Isle of Man, vast trees are discovered standing firm on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_721" id="Page_721">721</a></span>
their roots, though at the depth of eighteen or twenty feet below the
surface. Some naturalists have desired to refer the imbedding of timber
in peat-mosses to aqueous transportation, since rivers are well known
to float wood into lakes; but the facts above mentioned show that, in
numerous instances, such an hypothesis is inadmissible. It has, moreover,
been observed, that in Scotland, as also in many parts of the Continent,
the largest trees are found in those peat-mosses which lie in the
least elevated regions, and that the trees are proportionally smaller in
those which lie at higher levels; from which fact De Luc and Walker
have both inferred that the trees grew on the spot, for they would
naturally attain a greater size in lower and warmer levels. The leaves,
also, and fruits of each species, are continually found immersed in the
moss along with the parent trees; as, for example, the leaves and acorns
of the oak, the cones and leaves of the fir, and the nuts of the hazel.</p>

<p><i>Recent origin of some peat-mosses.</i>&mdash;In Hatfield moss, in Yorkshire,
which appears clearly to have been a forest eighteen hundred years
ago, fir-trees have been found ninety feet long, and sold for masts and
keels of ships; oaks have also been discovered there above one hundred
feet long. The dimensions of an oak from this moss are given in the
Philosophical Transactions, No. 275, which must have been larger than
any tree now existing in the British dominions.</p>

<p>In the same moss of Hatfield, as well as in that of Kincardine, in
Scotland, and several others, Roman roads have been found covered to the
depth of eight feet by peat. All the coins, axes, arms, and other utensils
found in British and French mosses, are also Roman; so that a
considerable portion of the peat in European peat-bogs is evidently not
more ancient than the age of Julius C&aelig;sar. Nor can any vestiges of
the ancient forests described by that general, along the line of the great
Roman way in Britain, be discovered, except in the ruined trunks of
trees in peat.</p>

<p>De Luc ascertained that the very sites of the aboriginal forests of Hercinia,
Semana, Ardennes, and several others, are now occupied by mosses
and fens; and a great part of these changes have, with much probability,
been attributed to the strict orders given by Severus, and other emperors,
to destroy all the wood in the conquered provinces. Several of the
British forests, however, which are now mosses, were cut at different
periods, by order of the English parliament, because they harbored wolves
or outlaws. Thus the Welsh woods were cut and burned, in the reign
of Edward I.; as were many of those in Ireland, by Henry II., to prevent
the natives from harboring in them, and harassing his troops.</p>

<p>It is curious to reflect that considerable tracts have, by these accidents,
been permanently sterilized, and that, during a period when civilization
has been making great progress, large areas in Europe have, by
human agency, been rendered less capable of administering to the
wants of man. Rennie observes,<a name="FNanchor_1010" id="FNanchor_1010"></a><a href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor">1010</a> with truth, that in those regions
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_722" id="Page_722">722</a></span>
alone which the Roman eagle never reached&mdash;in the remote circles of
the German empire, in Poland and Prussia, and still more in Norway,
Sweden, and the vast empire of Russia&mdash;can we see what Europe was
before it yielded to the power of Rome. Desolation now reigns where
stately forests of pine and oak once flourished, such as might now have
supplied all the navies of Europe with timber.</p>

<p><i>Sources of bog iron-ore.</i>&mdash;At the bottom of peat-mosses there is
sometimes found a cake, or "pan," as it is termed, of oxide of iron,
and the frequency of bog iron-ore is familiar to the mineralogist. The
oak, which is so often dyed black in peat, owes its color to the same
metal. From what source the iron is derived has often been a subject
of discussion, until the discoveries of Ehrenberg seem at length to
have removed the difficulty. He had observed in the marshes about
Berlin a substance of a deep ochre yellow passing into red, which
covered the bottom of the ditches, and which, where it had become dry
after the evaporation of the water, appeared exactly

<span class="figleft" style="width: 150px;"><span class="center3">Fig.&nbsp;101.</span><a name="f101" id="f101"></a><img src="images/f101.png" width="150" height="90" alt="Gaillonella ferruginea." title="" />

<span class="center3"><i>Gaillonella&nbsp;ferruginea.</i><br />
a. 2000 times magnified.</span></span>

like oxide of iron. But under the microscope it was
found to consist of slender articulated threads or
plates, partly siliceous and partly ferruginous, of
what he considered an animalcule, <i>Gaillonella ferruginea</i>,
but which most naturalists now regard as
a plant.<a name="FNanchor_1011" id="FNanchor_1011"></a><a href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor">1011</a> There can be little doubt, therefore, that
bog iron-ore consists of an aggregate of millions of these organic bodies
invisible to the naked eye.<a name="FNanchor_1012" id="FNanchor_1012"></a><a href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor">1012</a></p>

<p><i>Preservation of animal substances in peat.</i>&mdash;One interesting circumstance
attending the history of peat mosses is the high state of preservation
of animal substances buried in them for periods of many years.
In June, 1747, the body of a woman was found six feet deep, in a peat-moor
in the Isle of Axholm, in Lincolnshire. The antique sandals on
her feet afforded evidence of her having been buried there for many ages:
yet her nails, hair, and skin, are described as having shown hardly any
marks of decay. On the estate of the Earl of Moira, in Ireland, a human
body was dug up, a foot deep in gravel, covered with eleven feet of
moss; the body was completely clothed and the garments seemed all to
be made of hair. Before the use of wool was known in that country
the clothing of the inhabitants was made of hair, so that it would appear
that this body had been buried at that early period; yet it was fresh and
unimpaired.<a name="FNanchor_1013" id="FNanchor_1013"></a><a href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor">1013</a> In the Philosophical Transactions we find an example
recorded of the bodies of two persons having been buried in moist peat,
in Derbyshire, in 1674, about a yard deep, which were examined twenty-eight
years and nine months afterwards; "the color of their skin was
fair and natural, their flesh soft as that of persons newly dead."<a name="FNanchor_1014" id="FNanchor_1014"></a><a href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor">1014</a></p>

<p>Among other analogous facts we may mention, that in digging a pit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_723" id="Page_723">723</a></span>
for a well near Dulverton, in Somersetshire, many pigs were found in
various postures, still entire. Their shape was well preserved, the skin,
which retained the hair, having assumed a dry, membranous appearance.
Their whole substance was converted into a white, friable, laminated,
inodorous, and tasteless substance; but which, when exposed to heat,
emitted an odor precisely similar to broiled bacon.<a name="FNanchor_1015" id="FNanchor_1015"></a><a href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor">1015</a></p>

<p><i>Cause of the antiseptic property of peat.</i>&mdash;We naturally ask whence
peat derives this antiseptic property? It has been attributed by some to
the carbonic and gallic acids which issue from decayed wood, as also to
the presence of charred wood in the lowest strata of many peat-mosses,
for charcoal is a powerful antiseptic, and capable of purifying water
already putrid. Vegetable gums and resins also may operate in the
same way.<a name="FNanchor_1016" id="FNanchor_1016"></a><a href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a></p>

<p>The tannin occasionally present in peat is the produce, says Dr. MacCulloch,
of tormentilla, and some other plants; but the quantity he
thinks too small, and its occurrence too casual, to give rise to effects of
any importance. He hints that the soft parts of animal bodies, preserved
in peat-bogs, may have been converted into adipocire by the action of
water merely; an explanation which appears clearly applicable to some
of the cases above enumerated.<a name="FNanchor_1017" id="FNanchor_1017"></a><a href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a></p>

<p><i>Miring of quadrupeds.</i>&mdash;The manner, however, in which peat contributes
to preserve, for indefinite periods, the harder parts of terrestrial
animals, is a subject of more immediate interest to the geologist. There
are two ways in which animals become occasionally buried in the peat
of marshy grounds; they either sink down into the semifluid mud, underlying
a turfy surface upon which they have rashly ventured, or, at
other times, as we shall see in the sequel, a bog "bursts," and animals
may be involved in the peaty alluvium.</p>

<p>In the extensive bogs of Newfoundland, cattle are sometimes found
buried with only their heads and necks above ground; and after having
remained for days in this situation, they have been drawn out by ropes
and saved. In Scotland, also, cattle venturing on the "quaking moss"
are often mired, or "laired," as it is termed; and in Ireland, Mr. King
asserts that the number of cattle which are lost in sloughs is quite
incredible.<a name="FNanchor_1018" id="FNanchor_1018"></a><a href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a></p>

<p><i>Solway moss.</i>&mdash;The description given of the Solway moss will serve
to illustrate the general character of these boggy grounds. That moss,
observes Gilpin, is a flat area, about seven miles in circumference, situated
on the western confines of England and Scotland. Its surface is covered
with grass and rushes, presenting a dry crust and a fair appearance;
but it shakes under the least pressure, the bottom being unsound and
semifluid. The adventurous passenger, therefore, who sometimes in dry
seasons traverses this perilous waste, to save a few miles, picks his cautious
way over the rushy tussocks as they appear before him, for here the soil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_724" id="Page_724">724</a></span>
is firmest. If his foot slip, or if he venture to desert this mark of security,
it is possible he may never more be heard of.</p>

<p>"At the battle of Solway, in the time of Henry VIII. (1542), when
the Scotch army, commanded by Oliver Sinclair, was routed, an unfortunate
troop of horse, driven by their fears, plunged into this morass, which
instantly closed upon them. The tale was traditional, but it is now
authenticated; a man and horse, in complete armor, having been
found by peat-diggers, in the place where it was always supposed the
affair had happened. The skeleton of each was well preserved, and the
different parts of the armor easily distinguished."<a name="FNanchor_1019" id="FNanchor_1019"></a><a href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a></p>

<p>The same moss, on the 16th of December, 1772, having been filled
like a great sponge with water during heavy rains, swelled to an unusual
height above the surrounding country, and then burst. The turfy covering
seemed for a time to act like the skin of a bladder retaining the
fluid within, till it forced a passage for itself, when a stream of black
half-consolidated mud began at first to creep over the plain, resembling,
in the rate of its progress, an ordinary lava-current. No lives were lost,
but the deluge totally overwhelmed some cottages, and covered 400 acres.
The highest parts of the original moss subsided to the depth of about
twenty-five feet; and the height of the moss, on the lowest parts of the
country which it invaded, was at least fifteen feet.</p>

<p><i>Bursting of a peat-moss in Ireland.</i>&mdash;A recent inundation in Sligo
(January, 1831), affords another example of this phenomenon. After a
sudden thaw of snow, the bog between Bloomfield and Geevah gave way;
and a black deluge, carrying with it the contents of a hundred acres of
bog, took the direction of a small stream and rolled on with the violence
of a torrent, sweeping along heath, timber, mud, and stones, and overwhelming
many meadows and arable land. On passing through some
boggy land, the flood swept out a wide and deep ravine, and part of the
road leading from Bloomfield to St. James's Well was completely
carried away from below the foundation for the breadth of 200 yards.</p>

<p><i>Great Dismal Swamp.</i>&mdash;I have described, in my Travels in North
America,<a name="FNanchor_1020" id="FNanchor_1020"></a><a href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a> an extensive swamp or morass, forty miles long from north
to south, and twenty-five wide, between the towns of Norfolk in Virginia,
and Weldon in North Carolina. It is called the "Great Dismal," and
has somewhat the appearance of an inundated river-plain covered with
aquatic trees and shrubs, the soil being as black as that of a peat bog.
It is higher on all sides except one than the surrounding country, towards
which it sends forth streams of water to the north, east, and south, receiving
a supply from the west only. In its centre it rises 12 feet above
the flat region which bounds it. The soil, to the depth of 15 feet, is
formed of vegetable matter without any admixture, of earthy particles,
and offers an exception to a general rule before alluded to, namely, that
such peaty accumulations scarcely ever occur so far south as lat. 36&deg;, or
in any region where the summer heat is so great as in Virginia. In digging
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_725" id="Page_725">725</a></span>
canals through the morass for the purpose of obtaining timber,
much of the black soil has been thrown out from time to time, and exposed
to the sun and air, in which case it soon rots away so that
nothing remains behind, showing clearly that it owes its preservation to
the shade afforded by a luxuriant vegetation and to the constant evaporation
of the spongy soil by which the air is cooled during the hot
months. The surface of the bog is carpeted with mosses, and densely
covered with ferns and reeds, above which many evergreen shrubs and
trees flourish, especially the White Cedar (<i>Cupressus thyoides</i>), which
stands firmly supported by its long tap roots in the softest parts of the
quagmire. Over the whole the deciduous cypress (<i>Taxodium distichum</i>)
is seen to tower with its spreading top, in full leaf in the season when
the sun's rays are hottest, and when, if not intercepted by a screen of
foliage, they might soon cause the fallen leaves and dead plants of the
preceding autumn to decompose, instead of adding their contributions to
the peaty mass. On the surface of the wide morass lie innumerable trunks
of large and tall trees, while thousands of others, blown down by the
winds, are buried at various depths in the black mire below. They remind
the geologist of the prostrate position of large stems of Sigillaria
and Lepidodendron, converted into coal in ancient carboniferous rocks.</p>

<p><i>Bones of herbivorous quadrupeds in peat.</i>&mdash;The antlers of large and
full-grown stags are amongst the most common and conspicuous remains
of animals in peat. They are not horns which have been shed; for
portions of the skull are found attached, proving that the whole animal
perished. Bones of the ox, hog, horse, sheep, and other herbivorous
animals, also occur. M. Morren has discovered in the peat of Flanders
the bones of otters and beavers<a name="FNanchor_1021" id="FNanchor_1021"></a><a href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a>; but no remains have been met with
belonging to those extinct quadrupeds, of which the living congeners
inhabit warmer latitudes, such as the elephant, rhinoceros, hippopotamus,
hy&aelig;na, and tiger, though these are so common in superficial
deposits of silt, mud, sand, or stalactite, in various districts throughout
Great Britain. Their absence seems to imply that they had ceased to
live before the atmosphere of this part of the world acquired that cold
and humid character which favors the growth of peat.</p>

<p><i>Remains of ships, &amp;c., in peat mosses.</i>&mdash;From the facts before mentioned,
that mosses occasionally burst, and descend in a fluid state to
lower levels, it will readily be seen that lakes and arms of the sea may
occasionally become the receptacles of drift peat. Of this, accordingly,
there are numerous examples; and hence the alternations of clay and
sand with different deposits of peat so frequent on some coasts, as on
those of the Baltic and German Ocean. We are informed by Deguer,
that remains of ships, nautical instruments, and oars, have been found
in many of the Dutch mosses; and Gerard, in his History of the Valley
of the Somme, mentions that in the lowest tier of that moss was found
a boat loaded with bricks, proving that these mosses were at one period
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_726" id="Page_726">726</a></span>
navigable lakes and arms of the sea, as were also many mosses on the
coast of Picardy, Zealand, and Friesland, from which soda and salt are
procured.<a name="FNanchor_1022" id="FNanchor_1022"></a><a href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a> The canoes, stone hatchets, and stone arrow-heads found
in peat in different parts of Great Britain, lead to similar conclusions.</p>

<h5><i>Imbedding of human and other remains, and works of Art, in
Blown Sand.</i></h5>

<p>The drifting of sand may next be considered among the causes
capable of preserving organic remains and works of art on the emerged
land.</p>

<p><i>African Sands.</i>&mdash;The sands of the African deserts have been driven
by the west winds over part of the arable land of Egypt, on the western
bank of the Nile, in those places where valleys open into the plain,
or where there are gorges through the Libyan mountains. By similar
sand-drifts the ruins of ancient cities have been buried between the
temple of Jupiter Ammon and Nubia. M. G. A. De Luc attempted to
infer the recent origin of our continents, from the fact that these moving
sands have arrived only in modern times at the fertile plains of the Nile.
The same scourge, he said, would have afflicted Egypt for ages anterior
to the times of history, had the continents risen above the level of the
sea several hundred centuries before our era.<a name="FNanchor_1023" id="FNanchor_1023"></a><a href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a> But the author proceeded
in this, as in all his other chronological computations, on a multitude of
gratuitous assumptions. He ought, in the first place, to have demonstrated
that the whole continent of Africa was raised above the level of
the sea at one period; for unless this point was established, the region
from whence the sands began to move might have been the last addition
made to Africa, and the commencement of the sand-flood might have
been long posterior to the laying dry of the greater portion of that continent.
That the different parts of Europe were not all elevated at one
time is now generally admitted. De Luc should also have pointed out
the depth of drift sand in various parts of the great Libyan deserts, and
have shown whether any valleys of large dimensions had been filled up&mdash;how
long these may have arrested the progress of the sands, and how far
the flood had upon the whole advanced since the times of history.</p>

<p>We have seen that Sir J. G. Wilkinson is of opinion that, while the
sand-drift is making aggressions at certain points upon the fertile soil of
Egypt, the alluvial deposit of the Nile is advancing very generally upon
the desert; and that, upon the whole, the balance is greatly in favor of
the fertilizing mud.<a name="FNanchor_1024" id="FNanchor_1024"></a><a href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a></p>

<p>No mode of interment can be conceived, more favorable to the conservation
of monuments for indefinite periods than that now so common in
the region immediately westward of the Nile. The sand which surrounded
and filled the great temple of Ipsambul, first discovered by
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_727" id="Page_727">727</a></span>
Burckhardt, and afterwards partially uncovered by Belzoni and Beechey,
was so fine as to resemble a fluid when put in motion. Neither the
features of the colossal figures, nor the color of the stucco with which
some were covered, nor the paintings on the walls, had received any
injury from being enveloped for ages in this dry impalpable dust.<a name="FNanchor_1025" id="FNanchor_1025"></a><a href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a></p>

<p>At some future period, perhaps when the pyramids shall have perished,
the action of the sea, or an earthquake, may lay open to the day some of
these buried temples. Or we may suppose the desert to remain undisturbed,
and changes in the surrounding sea and land to modify the
climate and the direction of the prevailing winds, so that these may then
waft away the Libyan sands as gradually as they once brought them to
those regions. Thus, many a town and temple of higher antiquity than
Thebes or Memphis may reappear in their original antiquity, and a
part of the gloom which overhangs the history of the earlier nations be
dispelled.</p>

<p>Whole caravans are said to have been overwhelmed by the Libyan
sands; and Burckhardt informs us that "after passing the Akaba near
the head of the Red Sea, the bones of dead camels are the only guides of
the pilgrim through the wastes of sand."&mdash;"We did not see," says Captain
Lyon, speaking of a plain near the Soudah mountains, in Northern
Africa, "the least appearance of vegetation; but observed many skeletons
of animals, which had died of fatigue on the desert, and occasionally
the grave of some human being. All these bodies were so dried by the
heat of the sun, that putrefaction appears not to have taken place after
death. In recently expired animals I could not perceive the slightest
offensive smell; and in those long dead, the skin with the hair on it
remained unbroken and perfect, although so brittle as to break with a
slight blow. The sand-winds never cause these carcases to change their
places; for, in a short time, a slight mound is formed round them, and
they become stationary."<a name="FNanchor_1026" id="FNanchor_1026"></a><a href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a></p>

<p><i>Towns overwhelmed by sand floods.</i>&mdash;The burying of several towns and
villages in England, France, and Jutland, by blown sand, is on record;
thus, for example, near St. Pol de Leon, in Brittany, a whole village was
completely buried beneath drift sand, so that nothing was seen but the
spire of the church.<a name="FNanchor_1027" id="FNanchor_1027"></a><a href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a> In Jutland marine shells adhering to sea-weed are
sometimes blown by the violence of the wind to the height of 100 feet,
and buried in similar hills of sand.</p>

<p>In Suffolk, in the year 1688, part of Downham was overwhelmed by
sands which had broken loose about 100 years before, from a warren
five miles to the south-west. This sand had, in the course of a century,
travelled five miles, and covered more than 1000 acres of land.<a name="FNanchor_1028" id="FNanchor_1028"></a><a href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a> A considerable
tract of cultivated land on the north coast of Cornwall has been
inundated by drift sand, forming hills several hundred feet above the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_728" id="Page_728">728</a></span>
level of the sea, and composed of comminuted marine shells, in which some
terrestrial shells are enclosed entire. By the shifting of these sands the
ruins of ancient buildings have been discovered; and in some cases where
wells have been bored to a great depth, distinct strata, separated by a
vegetable crust, are visible. In some places, as at New Quay, large masses
have become sufficiently indurated to be used for architectural purposes.
The lapidification, which is still in progress, appears to be due to oxide of
iron held in solution by the water which percolates the sand.<a name="FNanchor_1029" id="FNanchor_1029"></a><a href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a></p>

<h5><i>Imbedding of Organic and other Remains in Volcanic Formations on
the Land.</i></h5>

<p>I have in some degree anticipated the subject of this section in former
chapters, when speaking of the buried cities around Naples, and those
on the flanks of Etna (pp. 385. 400.). From the facts referred to, it
appeared that the preservation of human remains and works of art is
frequently due to the descent of floods caused by the copious rains which
accompany eruptions. These aqueous lavas, as they are called in Campania,
flow with great rapidity, and in 1822 surprised and suffocated, as
was stated, seven persons in the villages of St. Sebastian and Massa, on
the flanks of Vesuvius.</p>

<p>In the tuffs, moreover, or solidified mud, deposited by these aqueous
lavas, impressions of leaves and of trees have been observed. Some of
those, formed after the eruption of Vesuvius in 1822, are now preserved
in the museum at Naples.</p>

<p>Lava itself may become indirectly the means of preserving terrestrial
remains, by overflowing beds of ashes, pumice, and ejected matter, which
may have been showered down upon animals and plants, or upon human
remains. Few substances are better non-conductors of heat than volcanic
dust and scori&aelig;, so that a bed of such materials is rarely melted by a
superimposed lava-current. After consolidation, the lava affords secure
protection to the lighter and more removable mass below, in which the
organic relics may be enveloped. The Herculanean tuffs containing the
rolls of papyrus, of which the characters are still legible, have, as was
before remarked, been for ages covered by lava.</p>

<p>Another mode by which lava may tend to the conservation of imbedded
remains, at least of works of human art, is by its overflowing them when
it is not intensely heated, in which case they sometimes suffer little or no
injury.</p>

<p>Thus when the Etnean lava-current of 1669 covered fourteen towns
and villages, and part of the city of Catania, it did not melt down a great
number of statues and other articles in the vaults of Catania; and at the
depth of thirty-five feet in the same current, on the site of Mompiliere, one
of the buried towns, the bell of a church and some statues were found
uninjured (p. 401.).</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_729" id="Page_729">729</a></span>
We read of several buried cities in Central India, and among others
of Oujein (or Oojain) which about fifty years before the Christian era
was the seat of empire, of art, and of learning; but which in the time
of the Rajah Vicramaditya, was overwhelmed, according to tradition,
together with more than eighty other large towns in the provinces of
Malwa and Bagur, "by a shower of earth." The city which now bears
the name is situated a mile to the southward of the ancient town. On
digging on the spot where the latter is supposed to have stood, to the
depth of fifteen or eighteen feet, there are frequently discovered, says Mr.
Hunter, entire brick walls, pillars of stone, and pieces of wood of an
extraordinary hardness, besides utensils of various kinds, ancient coins,
and occasionally buried wheat in a state resembling charcoal.<a name="FNanchor_1030" id="FNanchor_1030"></a><a href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a></p>

<p>The soil which covers Oujein is described as "being of an ash-gray
color, with minute specks of black sand."<a name="FNanchor_1031" id="FNanchor_1031"></a><a href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> And the "shower of earth,"
said to have "fallen from heaven," has been attributed by some travellers
to volcanic agency. There are, however, no active volcanoes in Central
India, the nearest to Oujein being Denodur hill near Bhooj, the capital
of Cutch, 300 geographical miles distant, if indeed that hill has ever
poured out lava in historical times, which is doubted by many.<a name="FNanchor_1032" id="FNanchor_1032"></a><a href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> The
latest writers on Oujein avow their suspicion that the supposed "catastrophe"
was nothing more than the political decline and final abandonment
of a great city which, like Nineveh or Babylon, and many an
ancient seat of empire in the East, after losing its importance as a metropolis,
became a heap of ruins. The rapidity with which the sun-dried
bricks, of which even the most splendid oriental palaces are often constructed,
crumble down when exposed to rain and sun, and are converted
into mounds of ordinary earth and clay, is well known. According to
Captain Dangerfield, trap tuff and columnar basalt constitute the rocks
in the environs of Oujein<a name="FNanchor_1033" id="FNanchor_1033"></a><a href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a>, and the volcanic nature of these formations,
from which the materials of the bricks were originally derived, may
have led to the idea of the city having been overwhelmed by a volcanic
eruption.</p>

<p><i>Fossils in alluvium.</i>&mdash;The next subject for our consideration, according
to the division before proposed, is the embedding of organic bodies
in alluvium.</p>

<p>The gravel, sand, and mud in the bed of a river does not often contain
any animal or vegetable remains; for the whole mass is so continually
shifting its place, and the attrition of the various parts is so great,
that even the hardest rocks contained in it are, at length, ground down
to powder. But when sand and sediment are suddenly swept by a flood,
and then let fall upon the land, such an alluvium may envelop trees or
the remains of animals, which, in this manner, are often permanently
preserved. In the mud and sand produced by the floods in Scotland, in
1829, the dead and mutilated bodies of hares, rabbits, moles, mice, partridges,
and even the bodies of men, were found partially buried.<a name="FNanchor_1034" id="FNanchor_1034"></a><a href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a> But
in these and similar cases one flood usually effaces the memorials left by
another, and there is rarely a sufficient depth of undisturbed transported
matter, in any one spot, to preserve the organic remains for ages from
destruction.</p>

<p>Where earthquakes prevail, and the levels of a country are changed
from time to time, the remains of animals may more easily be inhumed
and protected from disintegration. Portions of plains, loaded with alluvial
accumulations by transient floods, may be gradually upraised; and,
if any organic remains have been imbedded in the transported materials,
they may, after such elevation, be placed beyond the reach of the erosive
power of streams. In districts where the drainage is repeatedly deranged
by subterranean movements, every fissure, every hollow caused by the
sinking in of land, becomes a depository of organic and inorganic substances,
hurried along by transient floods.</p>

<p><i>Marine alluvium.</i>&mdash;In May, 1787, a dreadful inundation of the sea
was caused at Coringa, Ingeram, and other places, on the coast of Coromandel,
in the East Indies, by a hurricane blowing from the N. E., which
raised the waters so that they rolled inland to the distance of about
twenty miles from the shore, swept away many villages, drowned more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_731" id="Page_731">731</a></span>
than 10,000 people, and left the country covered with marine mud, on
which the carcasses of about 100,000 head of cattle were strewed. An old
tradition of the natives of a similar flood, said to have happened about a
century before, was, till this event, regarded as fabulous by the European
settlers.<a name="FNanchor_1035" id="FNanchor_1035"></a><a href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a> The same coast of Coromandel was, so late as May, 1832, the
scene of another catastrophe of the same kind; and when the inundation
subsided, several vessels were seen grounded in the fields of the low
country about Coringa.</p>

<p>Many of the storms termed hurricanes have evidently been connected
with submarine earthquakes, as is shown by the atmospheric phenomena
attendant on them, and by the sounds heard in the ground and the odors
emitted. Such were the circumstances which accompanied the swell of
the sea in Jamaica, in 1780, when a great wave desolated the western
coast, and bursting upon Savanna la Mar, swept away the whole town in
an instant, so that not a vestige of man, beast, or habitation, was seen
upon the surface.<a name="FNanchor_1036" id="FNanchor_1036"></a><a href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a></p>

<p><i>Houses and works of art in alluvial deposits.</i>&mdash;A very ancient subterranean
town, apparently of Hindoo origin, was discovered in India in
1833, in digging the Doab canal. Its site is north of Saharunpore, near
the town of Behat, and seventeen feet below the present surface of the
country. More than 170 coins of silver and copper have already been
found, and many articles in metal and earthenware. The overlying
deposit consisted of about five feet of river sand, with a substratum about
twelve feet thick of red alluvial clay. In the neighborhood are several
rivers and torrents, which descend from the mountains charged with vast
quantities of mud, sand, and shingle; and within the memory of persons
now living the modern Behat has been threatened by an inundation,
which, after retreating, left the neighboring country strewed over with
a superficial covering of sand several feet thick. In sinking wells in the
environs, masses of shingle and boulders have been reached resembling
those now in the river-channels of the same district, under a deposit of
thirty feet of reddish loam. Captain Cautley, therefore, who directed the
excavations, supposes that the matter discharged by torrents has gradually
raised the whole country skirting the base of the lower hills; and that the
ancient town, having been originally built in a hollow, was submerged by
floods, and covered over with sediment seventeen feet in thickness.<a name="FNanchor_1037" id="FNanchor_1037"></a><a href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a></p>

<p>We are informed, by M. Boblaye, that in the Morea, the formation
termed c&eacute;ramique, consisting of pottery, tiles, and bricks, intermixed
with various works of art, enters so largely into the alluvium and vegetable
soil upon the plains of Greece, and into hard and crystalline breccias
which have been formed at the foot of declivities, that it constitutes
an important stratum which might, in the absence of zoological characters,
serve to mark our epoch in a most indestructible manner.<a name="FNanchor_1038" id="FNanchor_1038"></a><a href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_732" id="Page_732">732</a></span>
<i>Landslips.</i>&mdash;The landslip, by suddenly precipitating large masses of
rock and soil into a valley, overwhelms a multitude of animals, and
sometimes buries permanently whole villages, with their inhabitants and
large herds of cattle. Thus three villages, with their entire population,
were covered, when the mountain of Piz fell in 1772, in the district of
Treviso, in the state of Venice,<a name="FNanchor_1039" id="FNanchor_1039"></a><a href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a> and part of Mount Grenier, south of
Chambery, in Savoy, which fell down in the year 1248, buried five
parishes, including the town and church of St. Andr&eacute;, the ruins occupying
an extent of about nine square miles.<a name="FNanchor_1040" id="FNanchor_1040"></a><a href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a></p>

<p>The number of lives lost by the slide of the Rossberg, in Switzerland,
in 1806, was estimated at more than 800, a great number of the bodies,
as well as several villages and scattered houses, being buried deep under
mud and rock. In the same country, several hundred cottages, with
eighteen of their inhabitants and a great number of cows, goats, and
sheep, were victims to the sudden fall of a bed of stones, thirty yards
deep, which descended from the summits of the Diablerets in Vallais.
In the year 1618, a portion of Mount Conto fell, in the county of Chiavenna,
in Switzerland, and buried the town of Pleurs with all its inhabitants,
to the number of 2430.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to multiply examples of similar local catastrophes,
which however numerous they may have been in mountainous parts of
Europe, within the historical period, have been, nevertheless, of rare occurrence
when compared to events of the same kind which have taken place
in regions convulsed by earthquakes. It is then that enormous masses
of rock and earth, even in comparatively low and level countries, are
detached from the sides of valleys, and cast down into the river courses,
and often so unexpectedly that they overwhelm, even in the daytime,
every living thing upon the plains.</p>

<h5><i>Preservation of Organic Remains in Fissures and Caves.</i></h5>

<p>In the history of earthquakes it was shown that many hundreds of
new fissures and chasms had opened in certain regions during the last
150 years, some of which are described as being of unfathomable depth.
We also perceive that mountain masses have been violently fractured and
dislocated, during their rise above the level of the sea; and thus we may
account for the existence of many cavities in the interior of the earth by
the simple agency of earthquakes; but there are some caverns, especially
in limestone rocks, which, although usually, if not always, connected
with rents, are nevertheless of such forms, and dimensions, alternately
expanding into spacious chambers, and then contracting again into narrow
passages, that it is difficult to conceive that they can owe their origin
to the mere fracturing and displacement of solid masses.</p>

<p>In the limestone of Kentucky, in the basin of Green River, one of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_733" id="Page_733">733</a></span>
tributaries of the Ohio, a line of underground cavities has been traced
in one direction for a distance of ten miles, without any termination; and
one of the chambers, of which there are many, all connected by narrow
tunnels, is no less than ten acres in area and 150 feet in its greatest
height. Besides the principal series of "antres vast," there are a great
many lateral embranchments not yet explored.<a name="FNanchor_1041" id="FNanchor_1041"></a><a href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a></p>

<p>The cavernous structure here alluded to is not altogether confined to
calcareous rocks; for it has lately been observed in micaceous and argillaceous
schist in the Grecian island of Thermia (Cythnos of the ancients),
one of the Cyclades. Here also spacious halls, with rounded and irregular
walls, are connected together by narrow passages or tunnels, and
there are many lateral branches which have no outlet. A current of
water has evidently at some period flowed through the whole, and left a
muddy deposit of bluish clay upon the floor; but the erosive action of
the stream cannot be supposed to have given rise to the excavations in
the first instance. M. Virlet suggests that fissures were first caused by
earthquakes, and that these fissures became the chimneys or vents for
the disengagement of gas, generated below by volcanic heat. Gases, he
observes, such as the muriatic, sulphuric, fluoric, and others, might, if
raised to a high temperature, alter and decompose the rocks which they
traverse. There are signs of the former action of such vapors in rents
of the micaceous schist of Thermia, and thermal springs now issue from
the grottoes of that island. We may suppose that afterwards the elements
of the decomposed rocks were gradually removed in a state of solution
by mineral waters; a theory which, according to M. Virlet, is confirmed
by the effect of heated gases which escape from rents in the isthmus of
Corinth, and which have greatly altered and corroded the hard siliceous
and jaspideous rocks.<a name="FNanchor_1042" id="FNanchor_1042"></a><a href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a></p>

<p>When we reflect on the quantity of carbonate of lime annually poured
out by mineral waters, we are prepared to admit that large cavities must,
in the course of ages, be formed at considerable depths below the surface
in calcareous rocks.<a name="FNanchor_1043" id="FNanchor_1043"></a><a href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a> These rocks, it will be remembered, are at once
more soluble, more permeable, and more fragile, than any others, at least
all the compact varieties are very easily broken by the movements of
earthquakes, which would produce only flexures in argillaceous strata.
Fissures once formed in limestone are not liable, as in many other formations,
to become closed up by impervious clayey matter, and hence a
stream of acidulous water might for ages obtain a free and unobstructed
passage.<a name="FNanchor_1044" id="FNanchor_1044"></a><a href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a></p>

<p><i>Morea.</i>&mdash;Nothing is more common in limestone districts than the
engulfment of rivers, which after holding a subterranean course for many
miles escape again by some new outlet. As they are usually charged
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_734" id="Page_734">734</a></span>
with fine sediment, and often with sand and pebbles where they enter,
whereas they are usually pure and limpid where they flow out again,
they must deposit much matter in empty spaces in the interior of the
earth. In addition to the materials thus introduced, stalagmite, or carbonate
of lime, drops from the roofs of caverns, and in this mixture the
bones of animals washed in by rivers are often entombed. In this manner
we may account for those bony breccias which we often find in caves,
some of which are of high antiquity while others are very recent and
in daily progress. In no district are engulfed streams more conspicuous
than in the Morea, where the phenomena attending them have been
lately studied and described in great detail by M. Boblaye and his fellow-laborers
of the French expedition to Greece.<a name="FNanchor_1045" id="FNanchor_1045"></a><a href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a> Their account is peculiarly
interesting to geologists, because it throws light on the red osseous
breccias containing the bones of extinct quadrupeds which are so common
in almost all the countries bordering the Mediterranean. It appears that
the numerous caverns of the Morea occur in a compact limestone, of the
age of the English chalk, immediately below which are arenaceous strata
referred to the period of our greensand. In the more elevated districts
of that peninsula there are many deep land-locked valleys, or basins,
closed round on all sides by mountains of fissured and cavernous limestone.
The year is divided almost as distinctly as between the tropics
into a rainy season, which lasts upwards of four months, and a season of
drought of nearly eight months' duration. When the torrents are
swollen by the rains, they rush from surrounding heights into the inclosed
basins; but, instead of giving rise to lakes, as would be the case in most
other countries, they are received into gulfs or chasms, called by the
Greeks "Katavothra," and which correspond to what are termed "swallow-holes"
in the north of England. The water of these torrents is
charged with pebbles and red ochreous earth, resembling precisely the
well-known cement of the osseous breccias of the Mediterranean. It
dissolves in acids with effervescence, and leaves a residue of hydrated
oxide of iron, granular iron, impalpable grains of silex, and small crystals
of quartz. Soil of the same description abounds everywhere on the
surface of the decomposing limestone in Greece, that rock containing in
it much siliceous and ferruginous matter.</p>

<p>Many of the Katavothra being insufficient to give passage to all the
water in the rainy season, a temporary lake is formed round the mouth
of the chasm, which then becomes still farther obstructed by pebbles,
sand, and red mud, thrown down from the turbid waters. The lake
being thus raised, its waters generally escape through other openings, at
higher levels, around the borders of the plain, constituting the bottom of
the closed basin.</p>

<p>In some places, as at Kavaros and Tripolitza, where the principal discharge
is by a gulf in the middle of the plain, nothing can be seen over
the opening in summer, when the lake dries up, but a deposit of red
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_735" id="Page_735">735</a></span>
mud, cracked in all directions. But the Katavothron is more commonly
situated at the foot of the surrounding escarpment of limestone; and in
that case there is sometimes room enough to allow a person to enter, in
summer, and even to penetrate far into the interior. Within is seen a
suite of chambers, communicating with each other by narrow passages;
and M. Virlet relates, that in one instance he observed, near the entrance,
human bones imbedded in recent red mud, mingled with the remains of
plants and animals of species now inhabiting the Morea. It is not
wonderful, he says, that the bones of man should be met with in such
receptacles; for so murderous have been the late wars in Greece, that
skeletons are often seen lying exposed on the surface of the country.<a name="FNanchor_1046" id="FNanchor_1046"></a><a href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a></p>

<p>In summer, when no water is flowing into the Katavothron, its mouth,
half closed up with red mud, is masked by a vigorous vegetation, which
is cherished by the moisture of the place. It is then the favorite hiding-place
and den of foxes and jackals; so that the same cavity serves at one
season of the year for the habitation of carnivorous beasts, and at another
as the channel of an engulfed river. Near the mouth of one chasm, M.
Boblaye and his companions saw the carcass of a horse, in part devoured,
the size of which seemed to have prevented the jackals from dragging it
in: the marks of their teeth were observed on the bones, and it was
evident that the floods of the ensuing winter would wash in whatsoever
might remain of the skeleton.</p>

<p>It has been stated that the waters of all these torrents of the Morea are
turbid where they are engulfed; but when they come out again, often at
the distance of many leagues, they are perfectly clear and limpid, being
only charged occasionally with a slight quantity of calcareous sand. The
points of efflux are usually near the sea-shores of the Morea, but sometimes
they are submarine; and when this is the case, the sands are seen
to boil up for a considerable space, and the surface of the sea, in calm
weather, swells in large convex waves. It is curious to reflect, that when
this discharge fails in seasons of drought, the pressure of the sea may
force its salt waters into subterraneous caverns, and carry in marine sand
and shells, to be mingled with ossiferous mud, and the remains of terrestrial
animals.</p>

<p>In general, however, the efflux of water at these inferior openings is
surprisingly uniform. It seems, therefore, that the large caverns in the
interior must serve as reservoirs, and that the water escapes gradually
from them, in consequence of the smallness of the rents and passages by
which they communicate with the surface.</p>

<p>The phenomena above described are not confined to the Morea, but
occur in Greece generally, and in those parts of Italy, Spain, Asia Minor,
and Syria, where the formations of the Morea extend. The Copaic lake
in B&oelig;otia has no outlet, except by underground channels; and hence
we can explain those traditional and historical accounts of its having
gained on the surrounding plains and overflowed towns, as such floods
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_736" id="Page_736">736</a></span>
must have happened whenever the outlet was partially choked up by mud,
gravel, or the subsidence of rocks, caused by earthquakes. When speaking
of the numerous fissures in the limestone of Greece, M. Boblaye
reminds us of the famous earthquake of 469 <span class="smcap">B. C.</span>, when, as we learn from
Cicero, Plutarch, Strabo, and Pliny, Sparta was laid in ruins, part of the
summit of Mount Taygetus torn off, and numerous gulfs and fissures
caused in the rocks of Laconia.</p>

<p>During the great earthquake of 1693, in Sicily, several thousand people
were at once entombed in the ruins of caverns in limestone, at Sortino
Vecchio; and, at the same time, a large stream, which had issued for
ages from one of the grottoes below that town, changed suddenly its subterranean
course, and came out from the mouth of a cave lower down
the valley, where no water had previously flowed. To this new point
the ancient water-mills were transferred, as I learnt when I visited the
spot in 1829.</p>

<p>When the courses of engulfed rivers are thus liable to change, from
time to time, by alterations in the levels of a country, and by the rending
and shattering of mountain masses, we must suppose that the dens of
wild beasts will sometimes be inundated by subterranean floods, and their
carcasses buried under heaps of alluvium. The bones, moreover, of individuals
which have died in the recesses of caves, or of animals which have
been carried in for prey, may be drifted along, and mixed up with mud,
sand, and fragments of rocks, so as to form osseous breccias.</p>

<p>In 1833 I had an opportunity of examining the celebrated caves of
Franconia, and among others that of Rabenstein, newly discovered. Their
general form, and the nature and arrangement of their contents, appeared
to me to agree perfectly with the notion of their having once served as
the channels of subterranean rivers. This mode of accounting for the
introduction of transported matter into the Franconian and other caves,
filled up as they often are even to their roofs with osseous breccia, was
long ago proposed by M. C. Prevost,<a name="FNanchor_1047" id="FNanchor_1047"></a><a href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a> and seems at length to be very
generally adopted. But I do not doubt that bears inhabited some of the
German caves, or that the cavern of Kirkdale, in Yorkshire, was once the
den of hy&aelig;nas. The abundance of bony dung, associated with hy&aelig;nas'
bones, has been pointed out by Dr. Buckland, and with reason, as confirmatory
of this opinion.</p>

<p>The same author observed in every cave examined by him in Germany,
that deposits of mud and sand, with or without rolled pebbles and angular
fragments of rock, were covered over with a <i>single</i> crust of stalagmite.<a name="FNanchor_1048" id="FNanchor_1048"></a><a href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a>
In the English caves he remarked a similar absence of <i>alterations</i> of alluvium
and stalagmite. But Dr. Schmerling has discovered in a cavern at
Chockier, about two leagues from Li&egrave;ge, three distinct beds of stalagmite,
and between each of them a mass of breccia, and mud mixed with quartz
pebbles, and in the three deposits the bones of extinct quadrupeds.<a name="FNanchor_1049" id="FNanchor_1049"></a><a href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_737" id="Page_737">737</a></span>
This exception does not invalidate the generality of the phenomenon
pointed out by Dr. Buckland, one cause of which may perhaps be this,
that if several floods pass at different intervals of time through a subterranean
passage, the last, if it has power to drift along fragments of rock,
will also tear up any alternating stalagmitic and alluvial beds that may
have been previously formed. Another cause may be, that a particular
line of caverns will rarely be so situated, in relation to the lowest levels
of a country, as to become, at two distinct epochs, the receptacle of engulfed
rivers; and if this should happen, some of the caves, or at least
the tunnels of communication, may at the first period be entirely choked
up with transported matter, so as not to allow the subsequent passage of
water in the same direction.</p>

<p>As the same chasms may remain open throughout periods of indefinite
duration, the species inhabiting a country may in the meantime be greatly
changed, and thus the remains of animals belonging to very different
epochs may become mingled together in a common tomb. For this
reason it is often difficult to separate the monuments of the human epoch
from those relating to periods long antecedent, and it was not without
great care and skill that Dr. Buckland was enabled to guard against such
anachronisms in his investigations of several of the English caves. He
mentions that human skeletons were found in the cave of Wokey Hole,
near Wells, in the Mendips, dispersed through reddish mud and clay,
and some of them united by stalagmite into a firm osseous breccia.
"The spot on which they lie is within reach of the highest floods of the
adjacent river, and the mud in which they are buried is evidently
fluviatile."<a name="FNanchor_1050" id="FNanchor_1050"></a><a href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a></p>

<p>In speaking of the cave of Paviland on the coast of Glamorganshire
the same author states that the entire mass through which bones were
dispersed appeared to have been disturbed by ancient diggings, so that
the remains of extinct animals had become mixed with recent bones and
shells. In the same cave was a human skeleton, and the remains of recent
testacea of eatable species, which may have been carried in by man.</p>

<p>In several caverns on the banks of the Meuse, near Li&egrave;ge, Dr. Schmerling
has found human bones in the same mud and breccia with those of
the elephant, rhinoceros, bear, and other quadrupeds of extinct species.
He has observed none of the dung of any of these animals: and from
this circumstance, and the appearance of the mud and pebbles, he concludes
that these caverns were never inhabited by wild beasts, but washed
in by a current of water. As the human skulls and bones were in fragments,
and no entire skeleton had been found, he does not believe that
these caves were places of sepulture, but that the human remains were
washed in at the same time as the bones of extinct quadrupeds, and that
these lost species of mammalia co-existed on the earth with man.</p>

<p><i>Caverns in the south of France.</i>&mdash;Similar associations in the south
of France, of human bones and works of art, with remains of extinct
quadrupeds, have induced other geologists to maintain that man was an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_738" id="Page_738">738</a></span>
inhabitant of that part of Europe before the rhinoceros, hy&aelig;na, tiger,
and many fossil species disappeared. I may first mention the cavern of
Bize, in the department of Aude, where M. Marcel de Serres met with a
small number of human bones mixed with those of extinct animals and
with land shells. They occur in a calcareous stony mass, bound together
by a cement of stalagmite. On examining the same caverns, M. Tournal
found not only in these calcareous beds, but also in a black mud which
overlies a red osseous mud, several human teeth, together with broken
angular fragments of a rude kind of pottery, and also recent marine and
terrestrial shells. The teeth preserve their enamel; but the fangs are so
much altered as to adhere strongly when applied to the tongue. Of the
terrestrial shells thus associated with the bones and pottery, the most
common are <i>Cyclostoma elegans</i>, <i>Bulimus decollatus</i>, <i>Helix nemoralis</i>,
and <i>H. nitida</i>. Among the marine are found <i>Pecten jacob&aelig;us</i>, <i>Mytilus
edulis</i>, and <i>Natica mille-punctata</i>, all of them eatable kinds, and which
may have been brought there for food. Bones were found in the same
mass belonging to three new species of deer, the brown bear (<i>Ursus
arcto&iuml;deus</i>), and the wild bull (<i>Bos urus</i>), formerly a native of
Germany.<a name="FNanchor_1051" id="FNanchor_1051"></a><a href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a></p>

<p>In the same parts of France, M. de Christol has found in caverns in a
tertiary limestone at Pondres and Souvignargues, two leagues north of
Lunel-viel, in the department of Herault, human bones and pottery confusedly
mixed with remains of the rhinoceros, bear, hy&aelig;na, and other
terrestrial mammifers. They were imbedded in alluvial mud, of the solidity
of calcareous tufa, and containing some flint pebbles and fragments
of the limestone of the country. Beneath this mixed accumulation,
which sometimes attained a thickness of thirteen feet, is the original
floor of the cavern, about a foot thick, covered with bones and the dung
of animals (<i>album gr&aelig;cum</i>), in a sandy and tufaceous cement.</p>

<p>The human bones in these caverns of Pondres and Souvignargues
were found, upon a careful analysis, to have parted with their animal
matter to as great a degree as those of the hy&aelig;na which accompany
them, and are equally brittle, and adhere as strongly to the tongue.</p>

<p>In order to compare the degree of alteration of these bones with those
known to be of high antiquity, M. Marcel de Serres and M. Ballard,
chemists of Montpelier, procured some from a Gaulish sarcophagus, in
the plain of Lunel, supposed to have been buried for fourteen or fifteen
centuries at least. In these the cellular tissue was empty, but they were
more solid than fresh bones. They did not adhere to the tongue in the
same manner as those of the caverns of Bize and Pondres, yet they
had lost at least three fourths of their original animal matter.</p>

<p>The superior solidity of the Gaulish bones to those in a fresh skeleton
is a fact in perfect accordance with the observations made by Dr. Mantell
on bones taken from a Saxon tumulus near Lewes.</p>

<p>M. Tessier has also described a cavern near Mialet, in the department
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_739" id="Page_739">739</a></span>
of Gard, where the remains of the bear and other animals were mingled
confusedly with human bones, coarse pottery, teeth pierced for amulets,
pointed fragments of bone, bracelets of bronze, and a Roman urn. Part
of this deposit reached to the roof of the cavity, and adhered firmly to it.
The author suggests that the exterior portion of the grotto may at one
period have been a den of bears, and that afterwards the aboriginal inhabitants
of the country took possession of it either for a dwelling or a burial-place,
and left there the coarse pottery, amulets, and pointed pieces of
bone. At a third period the Romans may have used the cavern as a
place of sepulture or concealment, and to them may have belonged the
urn and bracelets of metal. If we then suppose the course of the neighboring
river to be impeded by some temporary cause, a flood would be
occasioned, which, rushing into the open grotto, may have washed all
the remains into the interior caves and tunnels, heaping the whole confusedly
together.<a name="FNanchor_1052" id="FNanchor_1052"></a><a href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a></p>

<p>In the controversy which has arisen on this subject, MM. Marcel de
Serres, De Christol, Tournal, and others, have contended, that the phenomena
of this and other caverns in the south of France prove that the
fossil rhinoceros, hy&aelig;na, bear, and several other lost species, were once
contemporaneous inhabitants of the country, together with man; while
M. Desnoyers has supported the opposite opinion. The flint hatchets and
arrow-heads, he says, and the pointed bones and coarse pottery of many
French and English caves, agree precisely in character with those found
in the tumuli, and under the dolmens (rude altars of unhewn stone) of
the primitive inhabitants of Gaul, Britain, and Germany. The human
bones, therefore, in the caves which are associated with such fabricated
objects, must belong not to antediluvian periods, but to a people in the
same stage of civilization as those who constructed the tumuli and
altars.</p>

<p>In the Gaulish monuments we find, together with the objects of industry
above mentioned, the bones of wild and domestic animals of species
now inhabiting Europe, particularly of deer, sheep, wild-boars, dogs,
horses, and oxen. This fact has been ascertained in Quercy, and other
provinces; and it is supposed by antiquaries that the animals in question
were placed beneath the Celtic altars in memory of sacrifices offered to
the Gaulish divinity Hesus, and in the tombs to commemorate funeral
repasts, and also from a supposition prevalent among savage nations,
which induces them to lay up provisions for the manes of the dead in a
future life. But in none of these ancient monuments have any bones
been found of the elephant, rhinoceros, hy&aelig;na, tiger, and other quadrupeds,
such as are found in caves, as might certainly have been expected
had these species continued to flourish at the time that this part of Gaul
was inhabited by man.<a name="FNanchor_1053" id="FNanchor_1053"></a><a href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a></p>

<p>We are also reminded by M. Desnoyers of a passage in Florus, in which
it is related that C&aelig;sar ordered the caves into which the Aquitanian
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_740" id="Page_740">740</a></span>
Gauls had retreated to be closed up.<a name="FNanchor_1054" id="FNanchor_1054"></a><a href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> It is also on record, that so late
as the eighth century, the Aquitanians defended themselves in caverns
against King Pepin. As many of these caverns, therefore, may have
served in succession as temples and habitations, as places of sepulture,
concealment, or defence, it is easy to conceive that human bones, and
those of animals, in osseous breccias of much older date, may have been
swept away together, by inundations, and then buried in one promiscuous
heap.</p>

<p>It is not on the evidence of such intermixtures that we ought readily
to admit either the high antiquity of the human race, or the recent date
of certain lost species of quadrupeds.</p>

<p>Among the various modes in which the bones of animals become preserved,
independently of the agency of land floods and engulfed rivers, I
may mention that open fissures often serve as natural pitfalls in which
herbivorous animals perish. This may happen the more readily when
they are chased by beasts of prey, or when surprised while carelessly
browsing on the shrubs which so often overgrow and conceal the edges
of fissures.<a name="FNanchor_1055" id="FNanchor_1055"></a><a href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a></p>

<p>During the excavations recently made near Behat in India, the bones
of two deer were found at the bottom of an ancient well which had
been filled up with alluvial loam. Their horns were broken to pieces,
but the jaw bones and other parts of the skeleton remained tolerably
perfect. "Their presence," says Captain Cautley, "is easily accounted
for, as a great number of these and other animals are constantly lost in
galloping over the jungles and among the high grass by falling into
deserted wells."<a name="FNanchor_1056" id="FNanchor_1056"></a><a href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a></p>

<p>Above the village of Selside, near Ingleborough in Yorkshire, a
chasm of enormous but unknown depth occurs in the scar-limestone, a
member of the carboniferous series. "The chasm," says Professor Sedgwick,
"is surrounded by grassy shelving banks, and many animals,
tempted towards its brink, have fallen down and perished in it. The
approach of cattle is now prevented by a strong lofty wall; but there
can be no doubt that, during the last two or three thousand years, great
masses of bony breccia must have accumulated in the lower parts of the
great fissure, which probably descends through the whole thickness of the
scar-limestone, to the depth of perhaps five or six hundred feet."<a name="FNanchor_1057" id="FNanchor_1057"></a><a href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a></p>

<p>When any of these natural pit-falls happen to communicate with lines
of subterranean caverns, the bones, earth, and breccia, may sink by
their own weight, or be washed into the vaults below.</p>

<p>At the north extremity of the rock of Gibraltar are perpendicular
fissures, on the ledges of which a number of hawks nestle and rear their
young in the breeding season. They throw down from their nests the
bones of small birds, mice, and other animals, on which they feed, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_741" id="Page_741">741</a></span>
these are gradually united into a breccia of angular fragments of the
decomposing limestone with a cement of red earth.</p>

<p>At the pass of Escrinet in France, on the northern escarpment of the
Coiron hills, near Aubenas, I have seen a breccia in the act of forming.
Small pieces of disintegrating limestone are transported, during heavy
rains, by a streamlet, to the foot of the declivity, where land shells are
very abundant. The shells and pieces of stone soon become cemented
together by stalagmite into a compact mass, and the talus thus formed
is in one place fifty feet deep, and five hundred yards wide. So firmly
is the lowest portion consolidated, that it is quarried for mill-stones.</p>

<p><i>Recent, stalagmitic limestone of Cuba.</i>&mdash;One of the most singular
examples of the recent growth of stalagmitic limestone in caves and
fissures is that described by Mr. R. C. Taylor, as observable on the
north-east part of the island of Cuba.<a name="FNanchor_1058" id="FNanchor_1058"></a><a href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a> The country there is composed
of a white marble, in which are numerous cavities, partially filled with
a calcareous deposit of a brick-red color. In this red deposit are
shells, or often the hollow casts of shells, chiefly referable to eight or
nine species of land snails, a few scattered bones of quadrupeds, and,
what is still more singular, marine univalve shells, often at the height
of many hundred, or even one thousand feet above the sea. The following
explanation is given of the gradual increase of this deposit. Land
snails of the genera Helix, Cyclostoma, Pupa, and Clausilia, retire into
the caves, the floors of which are strewed with myriads of their dead
and unoccupied shells, at the same time that water infiltered through
the mountain throws down carbonate of lime, enveloping the shells,
together with fragments of the white limestone which occasionally falls
from the roof. Multitudes of bats resort to the caves; and their dung,
which is of a bright red color, (probably derived from the berries on
which they feed,) imparts its red hue to the mass. Sometimes also the
Hutia, or great Indian rat of the island, dies and leaves its bones in the
caves. "At certain seasons the soldier-crabs resort to the sea-shore, and
then return from their pilgrimage, each carrying with them, or rather
dragging, the shell of some marine univalve for many a weary mile.
They may be traced even at the distance of eight or ten miles from the
shore, on the summit of mountains 1200 feet high, like the pilgrims of
the olden times, each bearing his shell to denote the character and
extent of his wanderings." By this means several species of marine
testacea of the genera Trochus, Turbo, Littorina, and Monodonta, are
conveyed into inland caverns, and enter into the composition of the
newly formed rock.</p>

<p><i>Division of the subject.</i>&mdash;Having treated of the imbedding of organic
remains in deposits formed upon the land, I shall next consider the
including of the same in deposits formed under water.</p>

<p>It will be convenient to divide this branch of our subject into three
parts; considering, first, the various modes whereby the relics of <i>terrestrial</i>
species may be buried in subaqueous formations; secondly, the
modes whereby animals and plants inhabiting <i>fresh water</i> may be so
entombed; thirdly, how <i>marine</i> species may become preserved in new
strata.</p>

<p>The phenomena above enumerated demand a fuller share of attention
than those previously examined, since the deposits which originate upon
dry land are insignificant in thickness, superficial extent, and durability,
when contrasted with those of subaqueous origin. At the same time,
the study of the latter is beset with greater difficulties; for we are here
concerned with the results of processes much farther removed from the
sphere of ordinary observation. There is, indeed, no circumstance
which so seriously impedes the acquisition of just views in our science
as an habitual disregard of the important fact, that the reproductive
effects of the principal agents of change are confined to another
element&mdash;to that larger portion of the globe, from which by our very
organization we are almost entirely excluded.<a name="FNanchor_1059" id="FNanchor_1059"></a><a href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a></p>

<h5><i>Imbedding of Terrestrial Plants.</i></h5>

<p>When a tree falls into a river from the undermining of the banks or
from being washed in by a torrent or flood, it floats on the surface, not
because the woody portion is specifically lighter than water, but because
it is full of pores containing air. When soaked for a considerable time,
the water makes its way into these pores, and the wood becomes <i>waterlogged</i>
and sinks. The time required for this process varies in different
woods; but several kinds may be drifted to great distances, sometimes
across the ocean, before they lose their buoyancy.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_743" id="Page_743">743</a></span>
<i>Wood sunk to a great depth in the sea.</i>&mdash;If wood be sunk to vast
depths in the sea, it may be impregnated with water suddenly. Captain
Scoresby informs us, in his Account of the Arctic Regions, that on one
occasion a whale, on being harpooned, ran out all the lines in the boat,
which it then dragged under water, to the depth of several thousand feet,
the men having just time to escape to a piece of ice. When the fish
returned to the surface "to blow," it was struck a second time, and soon
afterwards killed. The moment it expired it began to sink,&mdash;an unusual
circumstance, which was found to be caused by the weight of the sunken
boat, which still remained attached to it. By means of harpoons and ropes
the fish was prevented from sinking, until it was released from the weight
by connecting a rope to the lines of the attached boat, which was no
sooner done than the fish rose again to the surface. The sunken boat
was then hauled up with great labor; for so heavy was it, that although
before the accident it would have been buoyant when full of water, yet
it now required a boat at each end to keep it from sinking. "When it
was hoisted into the ship, the paint came off the wood in large sheets;
and the planks, which were of wainscot, were as completely soaked in
every pore as if they had lain at the bottom of the sea since the flood!
A wooden apparatus that accompanied the boat in its progress through
the deep, consisting chiefly of a piece of thick deal, about fifteen inches
square, happened to fall overboard, and, though it originally consisted of
the lightest fir, sank in the water like a stone. The boat was rendered
useless; even the wood of which it was built, on being offered to the
cook for fuel, was tried and rejected as incombustible."<a name="FNanchor_1060" id="FNanchor_1060"></a><a href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a></p>

<p>Captain Scoresby found that, by sinking pieces of fir, elm, ash, &amp;c., to
the depth of four thousand and sometimes six thousand feet, they became
impregnated with sea-water, and when drawn up again, after immersion
for an hour, would no longer float. The effect of this impregnation was
to increase the dimensions as well as the specific gravity of the wood,
every solid inch having increased one-twentieth in size and twenty-one
twenty-fifths in weight.<a name="FNanchor_1061" id="FNanchor_1061"></a><a href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a></p>

<p><i>Drift-wood of the Mackenzie River.</i>&mdash;When timber is drifted down
by a river, it is often arrested by lakes; and, becoming water-logged, it
may sink and be imbedded in lacustrine strata, if any be there forming;
sometimes a portion floats on till it reaches the sea. In the course of
the Mackenzie River we have an example of vast accumulations of vegetable
matter now in progress under both these circumstances.</p>

<p>In Slave Lake in particular, which vies in dimensions with some of the
great fresh-water seas of Canada, the quantity of drift-timber brought
down annually is enormous. "As the trees," says Dr. Richardson,
"retain their roots, which are often loaded with earth and stones, they
readily sink, especially when water-soaked; and, accumulating in the
eddies, form shoals, which ultimately augment into islands. A thicket
of small willows covers the new-formed island as soon as it appears
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_744" id="Page_744">744</a></span>
above water, and their fibrous roots serve to bind the whole firmly
together. Sections of these islands are annually made by the river,
assisted by the frost; and it is interesting to study the diversity of appearances
they present, according to their different ages. The trunks of the
trees gradually decay until they are converted into a blackish brown
substance resembling peat, but which still retains more or less of the
fibrous structure of the wood; and layers of this often alternate with layers
of clay and sand, the whole being penetrated, to the depth of four or
five yards or more, by the long fibrous roots of the willows. A deposition
of this kind, with the aid of a little infiltration of bituminous matter,
would produce an excellent imitation of coal, with vegetable impressions
of the willow-roots. What appeared most remarkable was the horizontal
slaty structure that the old alluvial banks presented, or the <i>regular curve</i>
that the strata assumed from unequal subsidence.</p>

<p>"It was in the rivers only that we could observe sections of these
deposits; but the same operation goes on, on a much more magnificent
scale, in the lakes. A shoal of many miles in extent is formed on the
south side of Athabasca Lake, by the drift-timber and vegetable debris
brought down by the Elk River; and the Slave Lake itself must in
process of time be filled up by matters daily conveyed into it from Slave
River. Vast quantities of drift-timber are buried under the sand at the
mouth of the river, and enormous piles of it are accumulated on the
shores of every part of the lake."<a name="FNanchor_1062" id="FNanchor_1062"></a><a href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a></p>

<p>The banks of the Mackenzie display almost everywhere horizontal
beds of wood coal, alternating with bituminous clay, gravel, sand, and
friable sandstone; sections, in short, of such deposits as are now evidently
forming at the bottom of the lakes which it traverses.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the vast forests intercepted by the lakes, a still
greater mass of drift-wood is found where the Mackenzie reaches the
sea, in a latitude where no wood grows at present except a few stunted
willows. At the mouths of the river the alluvial matter has formed a
barrier of islands and shoals, where we may expect a great formation
of coal at some distant period.</p>

<p>The abundance of floating timber on the Mackenzie is owing, as Dr.
Richardson informs me, to the direction and to the length of the course
of this river, which runs from south to north, so that the sources of the
stream lie in much warmer latitudes than its mouths. In the country,
therefore, where the sources are situated, the frost breaks up at an
earlier season, while yet the waters in the lower part of its course are
ice-bound. Hence the current of water, rushing down northward,
reaches a point where the thaw has not begun, and, finding the channel
of the river blocked up with ice, it overflows the banks, sweeping
through forests of pines, and carrying away thousands of uprooted trees.</p>

<p><i>Drift-timber on coasts of Iceland, Spitzbergen, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The ancient
forests of Iceland, observes Malte-Brun, have been improvidently exhausted;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_745" id="Page_745">745</a></span>
but, although the Icelander can obtain no timber from the land, he is supplied
with it abundantly by the ocean. An immense quantity of thick
trunks of pines, firs, and other trees, are thrown upon the northern coast
of the island, especially upon the North Cape and Cape Langaness, and
are then carried by the waves along these two promontories to other parts
of the coast, so as to afford sufficiency of wood for fuel and for constructing
boats. Timber is also carried to the shores of Labrador and Greenland;
and Crantz assures us that the masses of floating wood thrown by the
waves upon the island of John de Mayen often equal the whole of that
island in extent.<a name="FNanchor_1063" id="FNanchor_1063"></a><a href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a></p>

<p>In a similar manner the bays of Spitzbergen are filled with drift-wood,
which accumulates also upon those parts of the coast of Siberia that are
exposed to the east, consisting of larch trees, pines, Siberian cedars, firs,
and Pernambuco and Campeachy woods. These trunks appear to have
been swept away by the great rivers of Asia and America. Some of them
are brought from the Gulf of Mexico by the Bahama stream; while
others are hurried forward by the current which, to the north of Siberia,
constantly sets in from east to west. Some of these trees have been deprived
of their bark by friction, but are in such a state of preservation as
to form excellent building timber.<a name="FNanchor_1064" id="FNanchor_1064"></a><a href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a> Parts of the branches and almost all
the roots remain fixed to the pines which have been drifted into the North
Sea, into latitudes too cold for the growth of such timber, but the trunks
are usually barked.</p>

<p>The leaves and lighter parts of plants are seldom carried out to sea, in
any part of the globe, except during tropical hurricanes among islands,
and during the agitations of the atmosphere which sometimes accompany
earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.</p>

<p><i>Comparative number of living and fossilized species of plants.</i>&mdash;It will
appear from these observations that, although the remains of terrestrial
vegetation, borne down by aqueous causes from the land, are chiefly deposited
at the bottom of lakes or at the mouths of rivers, yet a considerable
quantity is drifted about in all directions by currents, and may become
imbedded in any <i>marine</i> formation, or may sink down, when water-logged,
to the bottom of unfathomable abysses, and there accumulate without intermixture
with other substances.</p>

<p>It may be asked whether we have any data for inferring that the
remains of a considerable proportion of the existing species of plants will
be permanently preserved, so as to be hereafter recognizable, supposing
the strata now in progress to be at some future period upraised? To this
inquiry it may be answered, that there are no reasons for expecting that
more than a small number of the plants now flourishing in the globe will
become fossilized; since the entire habitations of a great number of them
are remote from lakes and seas, and even where they grow near to large
bodies of water, the circumstances are quite accidental and partial which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_746" id="Page_746">746</a></span>
favor the imbedding and conservation of vegetable remains. Suppose, for
example, that the species of plants inhabiting the hydrographical basin
of the Rhine, or that region, extending from the Alps to the sea, which is
watered by the Rhine and its numerous tributaries, to be about 2500 in
number, exclusive of the cryptogamic class. This estimate is by no means
exaggerated; yet if a geologist could explore the deposits which have
resulted from the sediment of the Rhine in the Lake of Constance, and
off the coast of Holland, he could scarcely expect to obtain from the
recent strata the leaves, wood, and seeds of <i>fifty</i> species in such a state
of preservation as to enable a botanist to determine their specific characters
with certainty.</p>

<p>Those naturalists, therefore, who infer that the ancient flora of the globe
was, at certain periods, less varied than now, merely because they have
as yet discovered only a few hundred fossil species of a particular epoch,
while they can enumerate more than one hundred thousand living ones,
are reasoning on a false basis, and their standard of comparison is not the
same in the two cases.</p>

<p><i>Submarine forests on coast of Hants.</i>&mdash;We have already seen that the
submarine position of several forests, or the remains of trees standing in a
vertical position on the British shores, has been due, in some instances,
to the subsidence of land.<a name="FNanchor_1065" id="FNanchor_1065"></a><a href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a> There are some cases which require a different
explanation. My friend, Mr. Charles Harris, discovered, in 1831, evident
traces of a fir-wood beneath the mean level of the sea, at Bournmouth,
in Hampshire, the formation having been laid open during a low spring
tide. It is composed of peat and wood, and is situated between the beach
and a bar of sand about 200 yards off, and extends fifty yards along the
shore. It also lies in the direct line of the Bournmouth Valley, from the
termination of which it is separated by 200 yards of shingle and drift-sand.
Down the valley flows a large brook, traversing near its mouth a
considerable tract of rough, boggy, and heathy ground, which produces a
few birch-trees, and a great abundance of the <i>Myrica gale</i>. Seventy-six
rings of annual growth were counted in a transverse section of one of the
buried fir-trees, which was fourteen inches in diameter. Besides the
stumps and roots of fir, pieces of alder and birch are found in the peat;
and it is a curious fact, that a part of many of the trees have been converted
into iron pyrites. The peat rests on pebbly strata, precisely similar
to the sand and pebbles occurring on the adjoining heaths.</p>

<p>As the sea is encroaching on this shore, we may suppose that at some
former period the Bourne Valley extended farther, and that its extremity
consisted, as at present, of boggy ground, partly clothed with fir-trees.
The bog rested on that bed of pebbles which we now see below the
peat; and the sea, in its progressive encroachments, eventually laid bare,
at low water, the sandy foundations; upon which a stream of fresh
water, rushing through the sand at the fall of the tides, carried out loose
sand with it. The super-stratum of vegetable matter, being matted and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_747" id="Page_747">747</a></span>
bound together by the roots of trees, remained; but being undermined,
sank down below the level of the sea, and then the waves washed sand
and shingle over it. In support of this hypothesis, it may be observed,
that small streams of fresh water often pass under the sands of the sea-beach,
so that they may be crossed dry-shod; and the water is seen, at
the point where it issues, to carry out sand and even pebbles.</p>

<p><i>Mineralization of plants</i>&mdash;Although the botanist and chemist have
as yet been unable to explain fully the manner in which wood becomes
petrified, it is nevertheless ascertained that, under favorable circumstances,
the lapidifying process is now continually going on. A piece
of wood was lately procured by Mr. Stokes, from an ancient Roman
aqueduct in Westphalia, in which some portions were converted into
spindle-shaped bodies, consisting of carbonate of lime, while the rest of
the wood remained in a comparatively unchanged state.<a name="FNanchor_1066" id="FNanchor_1066"></a><a href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a> It appears
that in some cases the most perishable, in others the most durable,
portions of plants are preserved, variations which doubtless depend on
the time when the mineral matter was supplied. If introduced immediately,
on the first commencement of decomposition, then the most
destructible parts are lapidified, while the more durable do not waste
away till afterwards, when the supply has failed, and so never become
petrified. The converse of these circumstances gives rise to exactly
opposite results.</p>

<p>Professor G&ouml;ppert, of Breslau, has instituted a series of curious
experiments, in which he has succeeded in producing some very remarkable
imitations of fossil petrifactions. He placed recent ferns between
soft layers of clay, dried these in the shade, and then slowly and
gradually heated them, till they were red-hot. The result was the
production of so perfect a counterpart of fossil plants as might have
deceived an experienced geologist. According to the different degrees
of heat applied, the plants were obtained in a brown or perfectly carbonized
condition; and sometimes, but more rarely, they were in a black
shining state, adhering closely to the layer of clay. If the red heat
was sustained until all the organic matter was burnt up, only an
impression of the plant remained.</p>

<p>The same chemist steeped plants in a moderately strong solution of
sulphate of iron, and left them immersed in it for several days, until
they were thoroughly soaked in the liquid. They were then dried, and
kept heated until they would no longer shrink in volume, and until
every trace of organic matter had disappeared. On cooling them he
found that the oxide formed by this process had taken the form of the
plants. A variety of other experiments were made by steeping animal
and vegetable substances in siliceous, calcareous, and metallic solutions,
and all tended to prove that the mineralization of organic bodies can be
carried much farther in a short time than had been previously supposed.<a name="FNanchor_1067" id="FNanchor_1067"></a><a href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_748" id="Page_748">748</a></span></p>

<h5><i>Imbedding of the Remains of Insects.</i></h5>

<p>I have observed the elytra and other parts of beetles in a band of
fissile clay, separating two beds of recent shell-marl, in the Loch of
Kinnordy in Forfarshire. Amongst these, Mr. Curtis recognized <i>Elator
lineatus</i> and <i>Atopa cervina</i>, species still living in Scotland. These, as
well as other remains which accompanied them, appear to belong to
terrestrial, not aquatic species, and must have been carried down in
muddy water during an inundation. In the lacustrine peat of the same
locality, the elytra of beetles are not uncommon; but in the deposits
of drained lakes generally, and in the silt of our estuaries, the relics of
this class of the animal kingdom are rare. In the blue clay of very
modern origin of Lewes levels, Dr. Mantell has found the Indusia, or
cases of the larv&aelig; of Phryganea, in abundance, with minute shells
belonging to the genera Planorbis, Limnea, &amp;c., adhering to them.<a name="FNanchor_1068" id="FNanchor_1068"></a><a href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a></p>

<p>When speaking of the migrations of insects, I pointed out that an
immense number are floated into lakes and seas by rivers, or blown by
winds far from the land; but they are so buoyant that we can only suppose
them, under very peculiar circumstances, to sink to the bottom
before they are either devoured by insectivorous animals or decomposed.</p>

<h5><i>Remains of Reptiles.</i></h5>

<p>As the bodies of several crocodiles were found in the mud brought
down to the sea by the river inundation which attended an earthquake
in Java, in the year 1699, we may imagine that extraordinary floods
of mud may stifle many individuals of the shoals of alligators and other
reptiles which frequent lakes and the deltas of rivers in tropical climates.
Thousands of frogs were found leaping about among the wreck, carried
into the sea by the inundations in Morayshire, in 1829;<a name="FNanchor_1069" id="FNanchor_1069"></a><a href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a> and it is
evident that whenever a sea-cliff is undermined, or land is swept by
other violent causes into the sea, land reptiles may be carried in.</p>

<h5><i>Remains of Birds.</i></h5>

<p>We might have anticipated that the imbedding of the remains of birds
in new strata would be of very rare occurrence; for their powers of flight
insure them against perishing, by numerous casualties to which quadrupeds
are exposed during floods; and if they chance to be drowned, or to die
when swimming on the water, it will scarcely ever happen that they will
be submerged so as to become preserved in sedimentary deposits. In
consequence of the hollow tubular structure of their bones and the
quantity of their feathers, they are extremely light in proportion to their
volume; so that when first killed they do not sink to the bottom like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_749" id="Page_749">749</a></span>
quadrupeds, but float on the surface until the carcass either rots away or
is devoured by predaceous animals. To these causes we may ascribe the
absence of any vestige of the bones of birds in the recent marl formations
of Scotland; although these lakes, until the moment when they were
artificially drained, were frequented by a great abundance of waterfowl.</p>

<h5><i>Imbedding of Terrestrial Quadrupeds.</i></h5>

<p>River inundations recur in most climates at very irregular intervals,
and expend their fury on those rich alluvial plains where herds of herbivorous
quadrupeds congregate together. These animals are often surprised;
and, being unable to stem the current, are hurried along until
they are drowned, when they sink at first immediately to the bottom.
Here their bodies are drifted along, together with sediment, into lakes or
seas, and may then be covered by a mass of mud, sand, and pebbles,
thrown down upon them. If there be no sediment superimposed, the
gases generated by putrefaction usually cause the bodies to rise again to
the surface about the ninth, or at latest the fourteenth day. The pressure
of a thin covering of mud would not be sufficient to retain them at the
bottom; for we see the putrid carcasses of dogs and cats, even in rivers,
floating with considerable weights attached to them, and in sea-water they
would be still more buoyant.</p>

<p>Where the body is so buried in drift sand, or mud accumulated upon
it, as never to rise again, the skeleton may be preserved entire; but if it
comes again to the surface while in the process of putrefaction, the bones
commonly fall piecemeal from the floating carcass, and may in that case
be scattered at random over the bottom of the lake, estuary, or sea; so
that a jaw may afterwards be found in one place, a rib in another, a
humerus in a third&mdash;all included, perhaps, in a matrix of fine materials,
where there may be evidence of slight transporting power in the current,
or even of none, but simply of some chemical precipitate.</p>

<p>A large number of the bodies of drowned animals, if they float into
the sea or a lake, especially in hot climates, are instantly devoured by
sharks, alligators, and other carnivorous beasts, which may have power
to digest even the bones; but during extraordinary floods, when the
greatest number of land animals are destroyed, the waters are commonly
so turbid, especially at the bottom of the channel, that even aquatic species
are compelled to escape into some retreat where there is clearer water,
lest they should be stifled. For this reason, as well as the rapidity of
sedimentary deposition at such seasons, the probability of carcasses
becoming permanently imbedded is considerable.</p>

<p><i>Flood in the Solway Firth, 1794.</i>&mdash;One of the most memorable
floods of modern date, in our island, is that which visited part of the
southern borders of Scotland, on the 24th of January, 1794, and which
spread particular devastation over the country adjoining the Solway
Firth.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_750" id="Page_750">750</a></span>
We learn from the account of Captain Napier, that the heavy rains
had swollen every stream which entered the Firth of Solway; so that
the inundation not only carried away a great number of cattle and sheep,
but many of the herdsmen and shepherds, washing down their bodies
into the estuary. After the storm, when the flood subsided, an extraordinary
spectacle was seen on a large sand-bank called "the beds of Esk,"
where there is a meeting of the tidal waters, and where heavy bodies are
usually left stranded after great floods. On this single bank were found
collected together the bodies of 9 black cattle, 3 horses, 1840 sheep,
45 dogs, 180 hares, besides a great number of smaller animals, and,
mingled with the rest, the corpses of two men and one woman.<a name="FNanchor_1070" id="FNanchor_1070"></a><a href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a></p>

<p><i>Floods in Scotland, 1829.</i>&mdash;In those more recent floods in Scotland,
in August, 1829, whereby a fertile district on the east coast became a
scene of dreadful desolation, a vast number of animals and plants
were washed from the land, and found scattered about after the storm,
around the mouths of the principal rivers. An eye-witness thus
describes the scene which presented itself at the mouth of the Spey,
in Morayshire:&mdash;"For several miles along the beach crowds were
employed in endeavoring to save the wood and other wreck with which
the heavy-rolling tide was loaded; whilst the margin of the sea was
strewed with the carcasses of domestic animals, and with millions of
dead hares and rabbits."<a name="FNanchor_1071" id="FNanchor_1071"></a><a href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a></p>

<p><i>Savannahs of South America.</i>&mdash;We are informed by Humboldt,
that during the periodical swellings of the large rivers in South America
great numbers of quadrupeds are annually drowned. Of the wild
horses, for example, which graze in immense troops in the savannahs,
thousands are said to perish when the river Apure, a tributary of the
Orinoco, is swollen, before they have time to reach the rising ground
of the Llanos. The mares, during the season of high water, may be
seen, followed by their colts, swimming about and feeding on the grass,
of which the top alone waves above the waters. In this state they are
pursued by crocodiles; and their thighs frequently bear the prints of
the teeth of these carnivorous reptiles. "Such is the pliability,"
observes the celebrated traveller, "of the organization of the animals
which man has subjected to his sway, that horses, cows, and other species
of European origin, lead, for a time, an amphibious life, surrounded
by crocodiles, water-serpents, and manatees. When the rivers return
again into their beds, they roam in the savannah, which is then spread
over with a fine odoriferous grass, and enjoy, as in their native climate,
the renewed vegetation of spring."<a name="FNanchor_1072" id="FNanchor_1072"></a><a href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a></p>

<p><i>Floods of the Parana.</i>&mdash;The great number of animals which are
drowned in seasons of drought in the tributaries of the Plata, was before
mentioned. Sir W. Parish states, that the Parana, flowing from the
mountains of Brazil to the estuary of the Plata, is liable to great floods,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_751" id="Page_751">751</a></span>
and during one of these, in the year 1812, vast quantities of cattle were
carried away, "and when the waters began to subside, and the islands
which they had covered became again visible, the whole atmosphere
for a time was poisoned by the effluvia from the innumerable carcasses
of skunks, capybaras, tigers, and other wild beasts which had been
drowned."<a name="FNanchor_1073" id="FNanchor_1073"></a><a href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a></p>

<p><i>Floods of the Ganges.</i>&mdash;We find it continually stated, by those who
describe the Ganges and Burrampooter, that these rivers carry before
them, during the flood season, not only floats of reeds and timber, but
dead bodies of men, deer, and oxen.<a name="FNanchor_1074" id="FNanchor_1074"></a><a href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a></p>

<p><i>In Java, 1699.</i>&mdash;I have already referred to the effects of a flood which
attended an earthquake in Java in 1699, when the turbid waters of the
Batavian river destroyed all the fish except the carp; and when drowned
buffaloes, tigers, rhinoceroses, deer, apes, and other wild beasts, were
brought down to the sea-coast by the current, with several crocodiles
which had been stifled in the mud. (See above, p. 503.)</p>

<p>On the western side of the same island, in the territory of Galongoon,
in the Regencies, a more recent volcanic eruption (that of 1822, before
described) (see above, p. <a href="#Page_431">431</a>) was attended by a flood, during which the
river Tandoi bore down hundreds of carcasses of rhinoceroses and buffaloes,
and swept away more than one hundred men and women from a
multitude assembled on its banks to celebrate a festival. Whether the
bodies reached the sea, or were deposited, with drift matter, in some large
intervening alluvial plains, we are not informed.<a name="FNanchor_1075" id="FNanchor_1075"></a><a href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a></p>

<p><i>Sumatra.</i>&mdash;"On the coast of Orissa," says Heynes, "I have seen tigers
and whole herds of black cattle carried along by what are called freshes,
and trees of immense size."<a name="FNanchor_1076" id="FNanchor_1076"></a><a href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a></p>

<p><i>In Virginia, 1771.</i>&mdash;I might enumerate a great number of local deluges
that have swept through the fertile lands bordering on large rivers,
especially in tropical countries, but I should surpass the limits assigned to
this work. I may observe, however, that the destruction of the islands,
in rivers, is often attended with great loss of lives. Thus when the principal
river in Virginia rose, in 1771, to the height of twenty-five feet above
its ordinary level, it swept entirely away Elk Island, on which were seven
hundred head of quadrupeds,&mdash;horses, oxen, sheep, and hogs,&mdash;and nearly
one hundred houses.<a name="FNanchor_1077" id="FNanchor_1077"></a><a href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a></p>

<p>The reader will gather, from what was before said respecting the deposition
of sediment by aqueous causes, that the greater number of the
remains of quadrupeds drifted away by rivers must be intercepted by
lakes before they reach the sea, or buried in freshwater formations near
the mouths of rivers. If they are carried still farther, the probabilities
are increased of their rising to the surface in a state of putrefaction,
and, in that case, of being there devoured by aquatic beasts of prey, or of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_752" id="Page_752">752</a></span>
subsiding into some spots whither no sediment is conveyed, and, consequently,
where every vestige of them will, in the course of time, disappear.</p>

<p><i>Skeletons of animals in recent shell-marl, Scotland.</i>&mdash;In some instances,
the skeletons of quadrupeds are met with abundantly in recent
shell-marls in Scotland, where we cannot suppose them to have been
imbedded by the action of rivers or floods. They all belong to species
which now inhabit, or are known to have been indigenous in Scotland.
The remains of several hundred skeletons have been procured within the
last century from five or six small lakes in Forfarshire, where shell-marl
has been worked. Those of the stag (<i>Cervus Elaphas</i>) are most numerous;
and if the others be arranged in the order of their relative abundance,
they will nearly follow thus&mdash;the ox, the boar, the horse, the
sheep, the dog, the hare, the fox, the wolf, and the cat. The beaver seems
extremely rare; but it has been found in the shell-marl of Loch Marlie, in
Perthshire, and in the parish of Edrom, in Berwickshire.</p>

<p>In the greater part of these lake-deposits there are no signs of floods;
and the expanse of water was originally so confined, that the smallest of
the above-mentioned quadrupeds could have crossed, by swimming from
one shore to the other. Deer, and such species as take readily to the
water, may often have been mired in trying to land, where the bottom
was soft and quaggy, and in their efforts to escape may have plunged
deeper into the marly bottom. Some individuals, I suspect, of different
species, have fallen in when crossing the frozen surface in winter; for
nothing can be more treacherous than the ice when covered with snow,
in consequence of the springs, which are numerous, and which, retaining
always an equal temperature, cause the ice, in certain spots, to be extremely
thin, while in every other part of the lake it is strong enough to bear the
heaviest weights.</p>

<p><i>Mammiferous remains in marine strata.</i>&mdash;As the bones of mammalia
are often so abundantly preserved in peat, and such lakes as have just
been described, the encroachments of a sea upon a coast may sometimes
throw down the imbedded skeletons, so that they may be carried away
by tides and currents, and entombed in submarine formations. Some of
the smaller quadrupeds, also, which burrow in the ground, as well as reptiles
and every species of plant, are liable to be cast down into the waves
by this cause, which must not be overlooked, although probably of comparatively
small importance amongst the numerous agents whereby terrestrial
organic remains are included in submarine strata.</p>

<p>During the great earthquake of Conception in 1835, some cattle,
which were standing on the steep sides of the island of Quiriquina, were
rolled by the shock into the sea, while on a low island at the head of the
Bay of Conception seventy animals were washed off by a great wave and
drowned.<a name="FNanchor_1078" id="FNanchor_1078"></a><a href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a></p>

<h6>IMBEDDING OF THE REMAINS OF MAN AND HIS WORKS IN
SUBAQUEOUS STRATA.</h6>

and houses&mdash;Loss of lives by shipwreck&mdash;How human corpses may be preserved

<p>I shall now proceed to inquire in what manner the mortal remains of
man and the works of his hands may be permanently preserved in subaqueous
strata. Of the many hundred million human beings which perish
in the course of every century on the land, every vestige is usually destroyed
in the course of a few thousand years; but of the smaller number
that perish in the waters, a certain proportion must be entombed under
circumstances that may enable parts of them to endure throughout entire
geological epochs.</p>

<p>The bodies of men, together with those of the inferior animals, are
occasionally washed down during river inundations into seas and lakes.
(See pp. 726-728.) Belzoni witnessed a flood on the Nile in September,
1818, where, although the river rose only three feet and a half above its
ordinary level, several villages, with some hundreds of men, women, and
children, were swept away.<a name="FNanchor_1079" id="FNanchor_1079"></a><a href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a> It was before mentioned that a rise of six
feet of water in the Ganges, in 1763, was attended with a much greater
loss of lives. (See above, p. 278.)</p>

<p>In the year 1771, when the inundations in the north of England
appear to have equalled the floods of Morayshire in 1829, a great number
of houses and their inhabitants were swept away by the rivers Tyne,
Can, Wear, Tees, and Greta; and no less than twenty-one bridges were
destroyed in the courses of these rivers. At the village of Bywell the
flood tore the dead bodies and coffins out of the churchyard, and bore
them away, together with many of the living inhabitants. During the
same tempest an immense number of cattle, horses, and sheep, were also
transported to the sea, while the whole coast was covered with the wreck
of ships. Four centuries before (in 1338), the same district had been
visited by a similar continuance of heavy rains, followed by disastrous
floods, and it is not improbable that these catastrophes may recur periodically,
though at uncertain intervals. As the population increases, and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_754" id="Page_754">754</a></span>
buildings and bridges are multiplied, we must expect the loss of lives and
property to augment.<a name="FNanchor_1080" id="FNanchor_1080"></a><a href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a></p>

<p><i>Fossilization of human bodies in the bed of the sea.</i>&mdash;If to the hundreds
of human bodies committed to the deep in the way of ordinary
burial we add those of individuals lost by shipwrecks, we shall find that
in the course of a single year, a great number of human remains are consigned
to the subaqueous regions. I shall hereafter advert to a calculation
by which it appears that more than five hundred <i>British</i> vessels
alone, averaging each a burthen of about 120 tons, are wrecked, and
sink to the bottom, <i>annually</i>. Of these the crews for the most part
escape, although it sometimes happens that all perish. In one great
naval action several thousand individuals sometimes share a watery grave.</p>

<p>Many of these corpses are instantly devoured by predaceous fish, sometimes
before they reach the bottom; still more frequently when they
rise again to the surface, and float in a state of putrefaction. Many
decompose on the floor of the ocean, where no sediment is thrown down
upon them; but if they fall upon a reef where corals and shells are
becoming agglutinated into a solid rock, or subside where the delta
of a river is advancing, they may be preserved for an incalculable series
of ages.</p>

<p>Often at the distance of a few hundred feet from a coral reef, where
wrecks are not unfrequent, there are no soundings at the depth of many
hundred fathoms. Canoes, merchant vessels, and ships of war, may have
sunk and have been enveloped, in such situations, in calcareous sand and
breccia, detached by the breakers from the summit of a submarine mountain.
Should a volcanic eruption happen to cover such remains with
ashes and sand, and a current of lava be afterwards poured over them,
the ships and human skeletons might remain uninjured beneath the
superincumbent mass, like the houses and works of art in the subterranean
cities of Campania. Already many human remains may have
been thus preserved beneath formations more than a thousand feet in
thickness; for, in some volcanic archipelagoes, a period of thirty or forty
centuries might well be supposed sufficient for such an accumulation. It
was stated, that at the distance of about forty miles from the base of the
delta of the Ganges there is an elliptical space about fifteen miles in
diameter, where soundings of from 100 to 300 fathoms sometimes fail to
reach the bottom. (See above, p. 279.) As during the flood season the quantity
of mud and sand poured by the great rivers into the Bay of Bengal
is so great that the sea only recovers its transparency at the distance of
sixty miles from the coast, this depression must be gradually shoaling,
especially as during the monsoons, the sea loaded with mud and sand, is
beaten back in that direction towards the delta. Now, if a ship or human
body sink to the bottom in such a spot, it is by no means improbable
that it may become buried under a depth of a thousand feet of sediment
in the same number of years.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_755" id="Page_755">755</a></span>
Even on that part of the floor of the ocean to which no accession of drift
matter is carried (a part which probably constitutes, at any given period,
by far the larger proportion of the whole submarine area), there are circumstances
accompanying a wreck which favor the conservation of skeletons.
For when the vessel fills suddenly with water, especially in the
night, many persons are drowned between decks and in their cabins, so
that their bodies are prevented from rising again to the surface. The
vessel often strikes upon an uneven bottom, and is overturned; in which
case the ballast, consisting of sand, shingle, and rock, or the cargo, frequently
composed of heavy and durable materials, may be thrown down
upon the carcasses. In the case of ships of war, cannon, shot, and
other warlike stores, may press down with their weight the timbers of the
vessel as they decay, and beneath these and the metallic substances the
bones of man may be preserved.</p>

<p><i>Number of wrecked vessels.</i>&mdash;When we reflect on the number of curious
monuments consigned to the bed of the ocean in the course of every
naval war from the earliest times, our conceptions are greatly raised
respecting the multiplicity of lasting memorials which man is leaving of
his labors. During our last great struggle with France, thirty-two of
our ships of the line went to the bottom in the space of twenty-two
years, besides seven 50-gun ships, eighty-six frigates, and a multitude of
smaller vessels. The navies of the other European powers, France, Holland,
Spain, and Denmark, were almost annihilated during the same
period, so that the aggregate of their losses must have many times
exceeded that of Great Britain. In every one of these ships were batteries
of cannon constructed of iron or brass, whereof a great number
had the dates and places of their manufacture inscribed upon them in
letters cast in metal. In each there were coins of copper, silver, and
often many of gold, capable of serving as valuable historical monuments;
in each were an infinite variety of instruments of the arts of war and
peace; many formed of materials, such as glass and earthenware, capable
of lasting for indefinite ages when once removed from the mechanical
action of the waves, and buried under a mass of matter which may
exclude the corroding action of sea-water. The quantity, moreover, of
timber which is conveyed from the land to the bed of the sea by the
sinking of ships of a large size is enormous, for it is computed that 2000
tons of wood are required for the building of one 74-gun ship; and
reckoning fifty oaks of 100 years growth to the acre, it would require
forty acres of oak forest to build one of these vessels.<a name="FNanchor_1081" id="FNanchor_1081"></a><a href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a></p>

<p>It would be an error to imagine that the fury of war is more conducive
than the peaceful spirit of commercial enterprise to the accumulation of
wrecked vessels in the bed of the sea. From an examination of Lloyd's
lists, from the year 1793 to the commencement of 1829, Captain W. H.
Smyth ascertained that the number of <i>British vessels</i> alone lost during
that period amounted on an average to no less than one and a half <i>daily</i>;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_756" id="Page_756">756</a></span>
an extent of loss which would hardly have been anticipated, although
we learn from Moreau's tables that the number of merchant vessels
employed at one time, in the navigation of England and Scotland, amounts
to about twenty thousand, having one with another a mean burthen of
120 tons.<a name="FNanchor_1082" id="FNanchor_1082"></a><a href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a> My friend, Mr. J. L. Prevost, also informs me that on inspecting
Lloyd's list for the years 1829, 1830, and 1831, he finds that no less
than 1953 vessels were lost in those three years, their average tonnage
being about 150 tons, or in all nearly 300,000 tons, being at the enormous
rate of 100,000 tons annually of the merchant vessels of one nation
only. This increased loss arises, I presume, from increasing activity in
commerce.</p>

<p>Out of 551 ships of the royal navy lost to the country during the
period above mentioned, only 160 were taken or destroyed by the enemy,
the rest having either stranded or foundered, or having been burnt by
accident; a striking proof that the dangers of our naval warfare, however
great, may be far exceeded by the storm, the shoal, the lee-shore,
and all the other perils of the deep.<a name="FNanchor_1083" id="FNanchor_1083"></a><a href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a></p>

<p><i>Durable nature of many of their contents.</i>&mdash;Millions of silver dollars
and other coins have been sometimes submerged in a single ship, and on
these, when they happen to be enveloped in a matrix capable of protecting
them from chemical changes, much information of historical interest
will remain inscribed, and endure for periods as indefinite as have the
delicate markings of zoophytes or lapidified plants in some of the ancient
secondary rocks. In almost every large ship, moreover, there are some
precious stones set in seals, and other articles of use and ornament composed
of the hardest substances in nature, on which letters and various
images are carved&mdash;engravings which they may retain when included in
subaqueous strata, as long as a crystal preserves its natural form.</p>

<p>It was, therefore, a splendid boast, that the deeds of the English chivalry
at Agincourt made Henry's chronicle</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;as rich with praise</span>
<span class="i0">As is the ooze and bottom of the deep</span>
<span class="i0">With sunken wreck and sumless treasuries</span>
</div>
</div>

<p>for it is probable that a greater number of monuments of the skill and
industry of man will, in the course of ages, be collected together in the
bed of the ocean, than will exist at any one time on the surface of the
continents.</p>

<p>If our species be of as recent a date as is generally supposed, it will
be vain to seek for the remains of man and the works of his hands imbedded
in submarine strata, except in those regions where violent earthquakes
are frequent, and the alterations of relative level so great, that
the bed of the sea may have been converted into land within the historical
era. We need not despair, however, of the discovery of such monuments,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_757" id="Page_757">757</a></span>
when those regions which have been peopled by man from the
earliest ages, and which are at the same time the principal theatres of
volcanic action, shall be examined by the joint skill of the antiquary and
geologist.</p>

<p><i>Power of human remains to resist decay.</i>&mdash;There can be no doubt
that human remains are as capable of resisting decay as are the harder
parts of the inferior animals; and I have already cited the remark of
Cuvier, that "in ancient fields of battle the bones of men have suffered
as little decomposition as those of horses which were buried in the same
grave." (See above, p. 147.) In the delta of the Ganges bones of men
have been found in digging a well at the depth of ninety feet;<a name="FNanchor_1084" id="FNanchor_1084"></a><a href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a> but as
that river frequently shifts its course and fills up its ancient channels, we
are not called upon to suppose that these bodies are of extremely high
antiquity, or that they were buried when that part of the surrounding
delta where they occur was first gained from the sea.</p>

<p><i>Fossil skeletons of men.</i>&mdash;Several skeletons of men, more or less mutilated,
have been found in the West Indies, on the north-west coast of
the main land of Guadaloupe, in a kind of rock which is known to be
forming daily, and which consists of minute fragments of shells and
corals, incrusted with a calcareous cement resembling travertin, by which
also the different grains are bound together. The lens shows that some
of the fragments of coral composing this stone still retain the same red
color which is seen in the reefs of living coral which surround the island.
The shells belong to species of the neighboring sea intermixed with
some terrestrial kinds which now live on the island, and among them is
the <i>Bulimus Gaudaloupensis</i> of F&eacute;russac. The human skeletons still
retain some of their animal matter, and all their phosphate of lime.
One of them, of which the head is wanting, may now be seen in the
British Museum, and another in the Royal Cabinet at Paris. According
to M. K&ouml;nig, the rock in which the former is inclosed is harder under
the mason's saw and chisel than statuary marble. It is described as
forming a kind of glacis, probably an indurated beach, which slants from
the steep cliffs of the island to the sea, and is nearly all submerged at
high tide.</p>

<p>Similar formations are in progress in the whole of the West Indian
archipelago, and they have greatly extended the plain of Cayes in St.
Domingo, where fragments of vases and other human works have been
found at a depth of twenty feet. In digging wells also near Catania, in
Sicily, tools have been discovered in a rock somewhat similar.</p>

<p><i>Buried ships, canoes, and works of art.</i>&mdash;When a vessel is stranded
in shallow water, it usually becomes the nucleus of a sand-bank, as has
been exemplified in several of our harbors, and this circumstance tends
greatly to its preservation. Between the years 1780 and 1790 a vessel
from Purbeck, laden with three hundred tons of stone, struck on a shoal
off the entrance of Poole harbor and foundered; the crew were saved,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_758" id="Page_758">758</a></span>
but the vessel and cargo remain to this day at the bottom. Since that
period the shoal at the entrance of the harbor has so extended itself in a
westerly direction towards Peveril Point in Purbeck, that the navigable
channel is thrown a mile nearer that point.<a name="FNanchor_1085" id="FNanchor_1085"></a><a href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a> The cause is obvious; the
tidal current deposits the sediment with which it is charged around any
object which checks its velocity. Matter also drifted along the bottom is
arrested by any obstacle, and accumulates round it, just as the African
sand-winds, before described, raise a small hillock over the carcass of
every dead camel exposed on the surface of the desert.</p>

<p>I before alluded to an ancient Dutch vessel, discovered in the deserted
channel of the river Rother in Sussex, of which the oak wood was much
blackened, but its texture unchanged. (See above, p. 316.) The interior
was filled with fluviatile silt, as was also the case in regard to a vessel
discovered in a former bed of the Mersey, and another disinterred
where the St. Katherine Docks are excavated in the alluvial plain of the
Thames. In like manner many ships have been found preserved entire
in modern strata, formed by the silting up of estuaries along the southern
shores of the Baltic, especially in Pomerania. Between Bromberg and
Nakel, for example, a vessel and two anchors in a very perfect state were
dug up far from the sea.<a name="FNanchor_1086" id="FNanchor_1086"></a><a href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a></p>

<p>Several vessels have been lately detected half buried in the delta of
the Indus, in the numerous deserted branches of that river, far from
where the stream now flows. One of these found near Vikkar in Sinde,
was 400 tons in burthen, old fashioned, and pierced for fourteen guns,
and in a region where it had been matter of dispute whether the Indus
had ever been navigable by large vessels.<a name="FNanchor_1087" id="FNanchor_1087"></a><a href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a></p>

<p>At the mouth of a river in Nova Scotia, a schooner of thirty-two tons,
laden with live stock, was lying with her side to the tide, when the bore,
or tidal wave, which rises there about ten feet in perpendicular height,
rushed into the estuary, and overturned the vessel, so that it instantly
disappeared. After the tide had ebbed, the schooner was so totally
buried in the sand, that the taffrel or upper rail over the stern was alone
visible.<a name="FNanchor_1088" id="FNanchor_1088"></a><a href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> We are informed by Leigh that, on draining Martin Meer, a
lake eighteen miles in circumference, in Lancashire, a bed of marl was
laid dry, wherein no fewer than eight canoes were found imbedded.
In figure and dimensions they were not unlike those now used in America.
In a morass about nine miles distant from this Meer a whetstone
and an axe of mixed metal were dug up.<a name="FNanchor_1089" id="FNanchor_1089"></a><a href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a> In Ayrshire, also, three canoes
were found in Loch Doon some few years ago; and during the year 1831
four others, each hewn out of separate oak trees. They were twenty-three
feet in length, two and a half in depth, and nearly four feet in
breadth at the stern. In the mud which filled one of them was found a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_759" id="Page_759">759</a></span>
war-club of oak and a stone battle-axe. A canoe of oak was also found
in 1820, in peat overlying the shell-marl of the Loch of Kinnordy, in
Forfarshire.<a name="FNanchor_1090" id="FNanchor_1090"></a><a href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a></p>

<p><i>Manner in which ships may be preserved in a deep sea.</i>&mdash;It is extremely
possible that the submerged woodwork of ships which have sunk where
the sea is two or three miles deep has undergone greater chemical
changes in an equal space of time, than in the cases above mentioned;
for the experiments of Scoresby show that wood may at certain depths
be impregnated in a single hour with salt water, so that its specific gravity
is entirely altered. It may often happen that hot springs, charged
with carbonate of lime, silex, and other mineral ingredients, may issue at
great depths, in which case every pore of the vegetable tissue may be
injected with the lapidifying liquid, whether calcareous or siliceous,
before the smallest decay commences. The conversion, also, of wood
into lignite is probably more rapid under enormous pressure. But the
change of the timber into lignite or coal would not prevent the original
form of a ship from being distinguished; for as we find, in strata of the
carboniferous era, the bark of the hollow reed-like trees converted into
coal, and the central cavity filled with sandstone, so might we trace the
outline of a ship in coal; while in the indurated mud, sandstone, or limestone,
filling the interior, we might discover instruments of human art,
ballast consisting of rocks foreign to the rest of the stratum, and other
contents of the ship.</p>

<p><i>Submerged metallic substances.</i>&mdash;Many of the metallic substances
which fall into the waters probably lose, in the course of ages, the forms
artificially imparted to them; but under certain circumstances these may
be preserved for indefinite periods. The cannon enclosed in a calcareous
rock, drawn up from the delta of the Rhone, which is now in the museum
at Montpellier, might probably have endured as long as the calcareous
matrix; but even if the metallic matter had been removed, and had entered
into new combinations, still a mould of its original shape would
have been left, corresponding to those impressions of shells which we see
in rocks, from which all the carbonate of lime has been subtracted.
About the year 1776, says Mr. King, some fishermen, sweeping for
anchors in the Gulf stream (a part of the sea near the Downs), drew up
a very curious old swivel gun, nearly eight feet in length. The barrel,
which was about five feet long, was of brass; but the handle by which it
was traversed was about three feet in length, and the swivel and pivot on
which it turned were of iron. Around these latter were formed incrustations
of sand converted into a kind of stone, of exceedingly strong texture
and firmness; whereas round the barrel of the gun, except where it was
near adjoining to the iron, there were no such incrustations, the greater
part of it being clean, and in good condition, just as if it had still continued
in use. In the incrusting stone, adhering to it on the outside, were a
number of shells and corallines, "just as they are often found in a fossil
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_760" id="Page_760">760</a></span>
state." These were all so strongly attached, that it required as much
force to separate them from the matrix "as to break a fragment off any
hard rock."<a name="FNanchor_1091" id="FNanchor_1091"></a><a href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a></p>

<p>In the year 1745, continues the same writer, the Fox man-of-war was
stranded on the coast of East Lothian, and went to pieces. About thirty-three
years afterwards a violent storm laid bare a part of the wreck, and
threw up near the place several masses, "consisting of iron, ropes, and
balls," covered over with ochreous sand, concreted and hardened into a
kind of stone. The substance of the rope was very little altered. The
consolidated sand retained perfect impressions of parts of an iron ring,
"just as impressions of extraneous fossil bodies are found in various kinds
of strata."<a name="FNanchor_1092" id="FNanchor_1092"></a><a href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a></p>

<p>After a storm in the year 1824, which occasioned a considerable shifting
of the sands near St. Andrew's, in Scotland, a gun-barrel of ancient
construction was found, which is conjectured to have belonged to one of
the wrecked vessels of the Spanish Armada. It is now in the museum
of the Antiquarian Society of Scotland, and is incrusted over by a thin
coating of sand, the grains of which are cemented by brown ferruginous
matter. Attached to this coating are fragments of various shells, as of
the common cardium, mya, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Many other examples are recorded of iron instruments taken up from
the bed of the sea near the British coast, incased by a thick coating
of conglomerate, consisting of pebbles and sand, cemented by oxide of
iron.</p>

<p>Dr. Davy describes a bronze helmet, of the antique Grecian form, taken
up in 1825, from a shallow part of the sea, between the citadel of Corfu
and the village of Castrades. Both the interior and exterior of the helmet
were partially incrusted with shells, and a deposit of carbonate of
lime. The surface generally, both under the incrustation, and where
freed from it, was of a variegated color, mottled with spots of green,
dirty white, and red. On minute inspection with a lens, the green and
red patches proved to consist of crystals of the red oxide and carbonate
of copper, and the dirty white chiefly of oxide of tin.</p>

<p>The mineralizing process, says Dr. Davy, which has produced these
new combinations, has, in general, penetrated very little into the substance
of the helmet. The incrustation and rust removed, the metal is
found bright beneath; in some places considerably corroded, in others
very slightly. It proves, on analysis, to be copper, alloyed with 18.5 per
cent. of tin. Its color is that of our common brass, and it possesses
a considerable degree of flexibility.</p>

<p>"It is a curious question," he adds, "how the crystals were formed in
the helmet, and on the adhering calcareous deposit. There being no
reason to suppose deposition from solution, are we not under the necessity
of inferring, that the mineralizing process depends on a small motion
and separation of the particles of the original compound? This motion
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_761" id="Page_761">761</a></span>
may have been due to the operation of electro-chemical powers which
may have separated the different metals of the alloy.<a name="FNanchor_1093" id="FNanchor_1093"></a><a href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a></p>

<h5><i>Effects of the Subsidence of Land, in imbedding Cities and Forests
in subaqueous Strata.</i></h5>

<p>We have hitherto considered the transportation of plants and animals
from the land by <i>aqueous</i> agents, and their inhumation in lacustrine or
submarine deposits, and we may now inquire what tendency the subsidence
of tracts of land may have to produce analogous effects. Several
examples of the sinking down of buildings, and portions of towns near
the shore, to various depths beneath the level of the sea during subterranean
movements, were before enumerated in treating of the changes
brought about by <i>inorganic</i> causes. The events alluded to were comprised
within a brief portion of the historical period, and confined to a
small number of the regions of active volcanoes. Yet these authentic
facts, relating merely to the last century and a half, gave indications of
considerable changes in the physical geography of the globe, and we are
not to suppose that these were the only spots throughout the surrounding
land and sea which suffered similar depressions.</p>

<p>If, during the short period since South America has been colonized by
Europeans, we have proof of alterations of level at the three principal
ports on the western shores, Callao, Valparaiso, and Conception,<a name="FNanchor_1094" id="FNanchor_1094"></a><a href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a> we
cannot for a moment suspect that these cities, so distant from each other,
have been selected as the peculiar points where the desolating power of
the earthquake has expended its chief fury. On considering how small
is the area occupied by the seaports of this disturbed region&mdash;points
where alone each slight change of the relative level of the sea and land
can be recognized,&mdash;and reflecting on the proofs in our possession of the
local revolutions that have happened on the site of each port, within the
last century and a half,&mdash;our conceptions must be greatly exalted respecting
the magnitude of the alterations which the country between the
Andes and the sea may have undergone, even in the course of the last
six thousand years.</p>

<p><i>Cutch earthquake.</i>&mdash;The manner in which a large extent of surface
may be submerged, so that the terrestrial plants and animals may be
imbedded in subaqueous strata, cannot be better illustrated than by the
earthquake of Cutch, in 1819, before alluded to (p. 460). It is stated,
that, for some years after that earthquake, the withered tamarisks and
other shrubs protruded their tops above the waves, in parts of the lagoon
formed by subsidence, on the site of the village of Sindree and its environs;
but, after the flood of 1826, they were seen no longer. Every
geologist will at once perceive, that forests sunk by such subterranean
movements may become imbedded in subaqueous deposits, both fluviatile
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_762" id="Page_762">762</a></span>
and marine, and the trees may still remain erect, or sometimes the roots
and part of the trunks may continue in their original position, while the
current may have broken off, or levelled with the ground, their upper
stems and branches.</p>

<p><i>Buildings how preserved under water.</i>&mdash;Some of the buildings which
have at different times subsided beneath the level of the sea have been
immediately covered up to a certain extent with strata of volcanic matter
showered down upon them. Such was the case at Tomboro in
Sumbawa, in the present century, and at the site of the Temple of Serapis,
in the environs of Puzzuoli, probably about the 12th century. The
entrance of a river charged with sediment in the vicinity may still more
frequently occasion the rapid envelopment of buildings in regularly stratified
formations. But if no foreign matter be introduced, the buildings,
when once removed to a depth where the action of the waves is insensible,
and where no great current happens to flow, may last for indefinite
periods, and be as durable as the floor of the ocean itself, which may
often be composed of the very same materials. There is no reason to
doubt the tradition mentioned by the classic writers, that the submerged
Grecian towns of Bura and Helice were seen under water; and it has
been already mentioned that different eye-witnesses have observed the
houses of Port Royal, at the bottom of the sea, at intervals of 88, 101,
and 143 years after the convulsion of 1692. (p. 505.)</p>

<p><i>Buried temples of Cashmere.</i>&mdash;The celebrated valley of Cashmere
(or Kashmir) in India, situated at the southern foot of the Himalaya
range, is about 60 miles in length, and 20 in breadth, surrounded by
mountains which rise abruptly from the plain to the height of about
5000 feet. In the cliffs of the river Jelam and its tributaries, which traverse
this beautiful valley, strata consisting of fine clay, sand, soft sandstone,
pebbles, and conglomerate are exposed to view. They contain
freshwater shells, of the genera Lymneus, Paludina, and Cyrena, with
land shells, all of recent species, and are precisely such deposits as
would be formed if the whole valley were now converted into a great
lake, and if the numerous rivers and torrents descending from the surrounding
mountains were allowed sufficient time to fill up the lake-basin
with fine sediment and gravel. Fragments of pottery met with at the
depth of 40 and 50 feet in this lacustrine formation show that the upper
part of it at least has accumulated within the human epoch.</p>

<p>Dr. Thomas Thomson, who visited Cashmere in 1848, observes that
several of the lakes which still exist in the great valley, such as that
near the town of Cashmere, five miles in diameter, and some others, are
deeper than the adjoining river-channels, and may have been formed by
subsidence during the numerous earthquakes which have convulsed that
region in the course of the last 2000 years. It is also probable that the
freshwater strata seen to extend far and wide over the whole of Cashmere
originated not in one continuous sheet of water once occupying
the entire valley, but in many lakes of limited area, formed and filled
in succession. Among other proofs of such lake-basins of moderate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_763" id="Page_763">763</a></span>
dimensions having once existed and having been converted into land at
different periods, Dr. Thomson mentions that the ruins of Avantipura,
not far from the modern village of that name, stand on an older freshwater
deposit at the base of the mountains, and terminate abruptly
towards the plain in a straight line, such as admits of no other explanation
than by supposing that the advance of the town in that direction
was arrested by a lake, now drained or represented only by a marsh.
In that neighborhood, as very generally throughout Cashmere, the
rivers run in channels or alluvial flats, bounded by cliffs of lacustrine
strata, horizontally stratified, and these strata form low table-lands from
20 to 50 feet high between the different watercourses. On a table-land
of this kind near Avantipura, portions of two buried temples are seen,
which have been partially explored by Major Cunningham, who, in
1847, discovered that in one of the buildings a magnificent colonnade
of seventy-four pillars is preserved underground. He exposed to view
three of the pillars in a cavity still open. All the architectural decorations
below the level of the soil are as perfect and fresh-looking as when
first executed. The spacious quadrangle must have been silted up
gradually at first, for some unsightly alterations, not in accordance with
the general plan and style of architecture, were detected, evidently of
subsequent date, and such as could only have been required when the
water and sediment had already gained a certain height in the interior
of the temple.</p>

<p>This edifice is supposed to have been erected about the year 850 of
our era, and was certainly submerged before the year 1416, when the
Mahomedan king, Sikandar, called Butshikan or the idol-breaker,
destroyed all the images of Hindoo temples in Cashmere. Ferishta the
historian particularly alludes to Sikandar having demolished every
Cashmerian temple save one, dedicated to Mahad&eacute;va, which escaped
"in consequence of its foundations being below the neighboring
water." The unharmed condition of the human-headed birds and other
images in the buried edifice near Avantipura leaves no doubt that they
escaped the fury of the iconoclast by being under water, and perhaps
silted up before the date of his conquest.<a name="FNanchor_1095" id="FNanchor_1095"></a><a href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a></p>

<p><i>Berkeley's arguments for the recent date of the creation of man.</i>&mdash;I
cannot conclude this chapter without recalling to the reader's mind a
memorable passage written by Bishop Berkeley a century ago, in which
he inferred, on grounds which may be termed strictly geological, the
recent date of the creation of man. "To any one," says he, "who
considers that on digging into the earth, such quantities of shells, and
in some places, bones and horns of animals, are found sound and entire,
after having lain there in all probability some thousands of years; it
should seem probable that guns, medals, and implements in metal or
stone, might have lasted entire, buried under ground forty or fifty
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_764" id="Page_764">764</a></span>
thousand years, if the world had been so old. How comes it then to
pass that no remains are found, no antiquities of those numerous ages
preceding the Scripture accounts of time; that no fragments of buildings,
no public monuments, no intaglios, cameos, statues, basso-relievos,
medals, inscriptions, utensils, or artificial works of any kind, are ever
discovered, which may bear testimony to the existence of those mighty
empires, those successions of monarchs, heroes, and demi-gods, for so
many thousand years? Let us look forward and suppose ten or twenty
thousand years to come, during which time we will suppose that plagues,
famine, wars, and <i>earthquakes</i> shall have made great havoc in the world,
is it not highly probable that at the end of such a period, pillars, vases,
and statues now in being, of granite, or porphyry, or jasper (stones of
such hardness as we know them to have lasted two thousand years
above ground, without any considerable alteration), would bear record
of these and past ages? Or that some of our current coins might then
be dug up, or old walls and the foundations of buildings show themselves,
as well as the shells and stones of <i>the primeval world</i>, which are
preserved down to our times."<a name="FNanchor_1096" id="FNanchor_1096"></a><a href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a></p>

<p>That many signs of the agency of man would have lasted at least as
long as "the shells of the primeval world," had our race been so ancient,
we may feel as fully persuaded as Berkeley; and we may anticipate with
confidence that many edifices and implements of human workmanship
and the skeletons of men, and casts of the human form, will continue to
exist when a great part of the present mountains, continents, and seas
have disappeared. Assuming the future duration of the planet to be
indefinitely protracted, we can foresee no limit to the perpetuation of
some of the memorials of man, which are continually entombed in the
bowels of the earth or in the bed of the ocean, unless we carry forward
our views to a period sufficient to allow the various causes of change,
both igneous and aqueous, to remodel more than once the entire crust
of the earth. <i>One</i> complete revolution will be inadequate to efface
every monument of our existence; for many works of art might enter
again and again into the formations of successive eras, and escape
obliteration even though the very rocks in which they had been for
ages imbedded were destroyed, just as pebbles included in the conglomerates
of one epoch often contain the organized remains of beings
which flourished during a prior era.</p>

<p>Yet it is no less true, as a late distinguished philosopher has declared,
"that none of the works of a mortal being can be eternal."<a name="FNanchor_1097" id="FNanchor_1097"></a><a href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a> They are
in the first place wrested from the hands of man, and lost as far as regards
their subserviency to his use, by the instrumentality of those very
causes which place them in situations where they are enabled to endure
for indefinite periods. And even when they have been included in rocky
strata, when they have been made to enter as it were into the solid frame
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_765" id="Page_765">765</a></span>work
of the globe itself, they must nevertheless eventually perish; for
every year some portion of the earth's crust is shattered by earthquakes,
or melted by volcanic fire, or ground to dust by the moving waters on the
surface. "The river of Lethe," as Bacon eloquently remarks, "runneth
as well above ground as below."<a name="FNanchor_1098" id="FNanchor_1098"></a><a href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a></p>

<p>Having treated of the imbedding of terrestrial plants and animals,
and of human remains, in deposits now forming beneath the waters, I
come next to consider in what manner <i>aquatic</i> species may be entombed
in strata formed in their own element.</p>

<p><i>Freshwater plants and animals.</i>&mdash;The remains of species belonging
to those genera of the animal and vegetable kingdoms which are more
or less exclusively confined to fresh water are for the most part preserved
in the beds of lakes or estuaries, but they are oftentimes swept down by
rivers into the sea, and there intermingled with the exuvi&aelig; of marine
races. The phenomena attending their inhumation in lacustrine deposits
are sometimes revealed to our observation by the drainage of small lakes,
such as are those in Scotland, which have been laid dry for the sake of
obtaining shell marl for agricultural uses.</p>

<p>In these recent formations, as seen in Forfarshire, two or three beds
of calcareous marl are sometimes observed separated from each other by
layers of drift peat, sand, or fissile clay. The marl often consists almost
entirely of an aggregate of shells of the genera Limnea, Planorbis, Valvata,
and Cyclas, of species now existing in Scotland. A considerable
proportion of the Testacea appear to have died very young, and few
of the shells are of a size which indicates their having attained a state
of maturity. The shells are sometimes entirely decomposed, forming a
pulverulent marl; sometimes in a state of good preservation. They are
frequently intermixed with stems of Char&aelig; and other aquatic vegetables,
the whole being matted together and compressed, forming lamin&aelig; often
as thin as paper.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_766" id="Page_766">766</a></span>
<i>Fossilized seed-vessels and stems of Chara.</i>&mdash;As the Chara is an
aquatic plant which occurs frequently fossil in formations of different
eras, and is often of much importance to the geologist in characterizing
entire groups of strata, I shall describe the manner in which I have
found the recent species in a petrified state. They occur in a marl-lake
in Forfarshire, inclosed in nodules, and sometimes in a continuous stratum
of a kind of travertin.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 102.</span><a name="f102" id="f102"></a><img src="images/f102.jpg" width="550" height="401" alt="Seed-vessel of Chara hispida." title="" />

<p class="small"><i>a</i>, Part of the stem with the seed-vessel attached. Magnified.</p>

<p class="small"><i>b</i>, Natural size of the seed vessel.</p>

<p class="small"><i>c</i>, Integument of the Gyrogonite, or petrified seed-vessel of <i>Chara hispida</i>, found in the

<p class="small"><i>f</i>, Upper end of the integument to which the stigmata were attached.</p>

<p class="small"><i>g</i>, One of the spiral valves of <i>c</i>.</p></div>

<p>The seed-vessel of these plants is remarkably tough and hard, and
consists of a membranous nut covered by an integument (<i>d</i>, <a href="#f102">fig. 102</a>.)
both of which are spirally striated or ribbed. The integument is composed
of five spiral valves, of a quadrangular form (<i>g</i>). In <i>Chara hispida</i>,
which abounds in the lakes of Forfarshire, and which has become
fossil in the Bakie Loch, each of the spiral valves of the seed-vessel turns
rather more than twice round the circumference, the whole together
making between ten and eleven rings. The number of these rings differs
greatly in different species, but in the same appears to be very constant.</p>

<p>The stems of Char&aelig; occur fossil in the Scotch marl in great abundance.
In some species, as in <i>Chara hispida</i>, the plant when living
contains so much carbonate of lime in its vegetable organization, independently
of calcareous incrustation, that it effervesces strongly with
acids when dry. The stems of <i>Chara hispida</i> are longitudinally striated,
with a tendency to be spiral. These stri&aelig;, as appears to be the case
with all Char&aelig;, turn always like the worm of a screw from right to left,
while those of the seed-vessel wind round in a contrary direction. A
cross section of the stem exhibits a curious structure, for it is composed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_767" id="Page_767">767</a></span>
of a large tube surrounded by smaller tubes (<a href="#f103">fig. 103</a>., <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>) as is seen in
some extinct as well as recent species. In the stems of several species,
however, there is only a single tube.<a name="FNanchor_1099" id="FNanchor_1099"></a><a href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 103.</span><a name="f103" id="f103"></a><img src="images/f103.jpg" width="450" height="470" alt="Stem and branches of Chara hispida." title="" />

</p>

<p>The valves of a small animal called cypris (<i>C. ornata?</i> Lam.) occur
completely fossilized, like the stems of Char&aelig;, in the Scotch travertin
above mentioned. The same cypris inhabits the lakes and ponds of
England, where, together with many other species, it is not uncommon.
Although extremely minute, they are visible to the naked eye, and may
be observed in great numbers, swimming swiftly through the waters of
our stagnant pools and ditches. The antenn&aelig;, at the end of which are
fine pencils of hair, are the principal organs for swimming, and are
moved with great rapidity. The animal resides within two small valves,
not unlike those of a bivalve shell, and moults its integuments annually,
which the conchiferous mollusks do not. The cast-off shells, resembling
thin scales, and occurring in countless myriads in many ancient freshwater

derived from plates of mica.</p>

<p>The recent strata of lacustrine origin above alluded to are of very
small extent, but analogous deposits on the grandest scale are forming
in the great Canadian lakes, as in Lakes Superior and Huron, where beds
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_768" id="Page_768">768</a></span>
of sand and clay are seen inclosing shells of existing species.<a name="FNanchor_1101" id="FNanchor_1101"></a><a href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a> The
Chara also plays the same part in the subaqueous vegetation of North
America as in Europe. I observed along the borders of several freshwater
lakes in the state of New York a luxuriant crop of this plant in
clear water of moderate depth, rendering the bottom as verdant as a
grassy meadow. Here, therefore, we may expect some of the tough
seed vessels to be preserved in mud, just as we detect them fossil in the
Eocene strata of Hampshire, or in the neighborhood of Paris, and many
other countries.</p>

<h5><i>Imbedding of freshwater Species in Estuary and Marine Deposits.</i></h5>

<p><i>In Lewes levels.</i>&mdash;We have sometimes an opportunity of examining
the deposits which within the historical period have silted up some of
our estuaries; and excavations made for wells and other purposes,
where the sea has been finally excluded, enable us to observe the state
of the organic remains in these tracts. The valley of the Ouze between
Newhaven and Lewes is one of several estuaries from which the sea has
retired within the last seven or eight centuries; and here, as appears
from the researches of Dr. Mantell, strata thirty feet and upwards in
thickness have accumulated. At the top, beneath the vegetable soil, is
a bed of peat about five feet thick, inclosing many trunks of trees.
Next below is a stratum of blue clay containing freshwater shells of
about nine species, such as now inhabit the district. Intermixed with
these was observed the skeleton of a deer. Lower down, the layers of
blue clay contain, with the above-mentioned freshwater shells, several
marine species well known on our coast. In the lowest beds, often at
the depth of thirty-six feet; these marine Testacea occur without the
slightest intermixture of fluviatile species, and amongst them the skull
of the narwal, or sea unicorn (<i>Monodon monoceros</i>), has been detected.
Underneath all these deposits is a bed of pipe-clay, derived from the
subjacent chalk.<a name="FNanchor_1102" id="FNanchor_1102"></a><a href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_769" id="Page_769">769</a></span>
If we had no historical information respecting the former existence of
an inlet of the sea in this valley and of its gradual obliteration, the
inspection of the section above described would show, as clearly as a
written chronicle, the following sequence of events. First, there was a
salt-water estuary peopled for many years by species of marine Testacea
identical with those now living, and into which some of the larger Cetacea
occasionally entered. Secondly, the inlet grew shallower, and the
water became brackish, or alternately salt and fresh, so that the remains
of freshwater and marine shells were mingled in the blue argillaceous
sediment of its bottom. Thirdly, the shoaling continued until the river-water
prevailed, so that it was no longer habitable by marine Testacea,
but fitted only for the abode of fluviatile species and aquatic insects.
Fourthly, a peaty swamp or morass was formed, where some trees grew,
or perhaps were drifted during floods, and where terrestrial quadrupeds
were mired. Finally, the soil being flooded by the river only at distant
intervals, became a verdant meadow.</p>

<p><i>In delta of Ganges and Indus.</i>&mdash;It was before stated, that on the
sea-coast, in the delta of the Ganges, there are eight great openings,
each of which has evidently, at some ancient period, served in its turn
as the principal channel of discharge.<a name="FNanchor_1103" id="FNanchor_1103"></a><a href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a> As the base of the delta is 200
miles in length, it must happen that, as often as the great volume of
river-water is thrown into the sea by a new mouth, the sea will at one
point be converted from salt to fresh, and at another from fresh to salt;
for, with the exception of those parts where the principal discharge takes
place, the salt water not only washes the base of the delta, but enters far
into every creek and lagoon. It is evident, then, that repeated alternations
of beds containing freshwater shells, with others filled with marine
exuvi&aelig;, may here be formed. It has also been shown by artesian borings
at Calcutta (see above, p. <a href="#Page_267">267</a>), that the delta once extended much farther
than now into the gulf, and that the river is only recovering
from the sea the ground which had been lost by subsidence at some
former period. Analogous phenomena must sometimes be occasioned
by such alternate elevation and depression as has occurred in modern
times in the delta of the Indus.<a name="FNanchor_1104" id="FNanchor_1104"></a><a href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a> But the subterranean movements
affect but a small number of the deltas formed at one period on the
globe; whereas the silting up of some of the arms of great rivers
and the opening of others, and the consequent variation of the points
where the chief volume of their waters is discharged into the sea, are
phenomena common to almost every delta.</p>

<p>The variety of species of Testacea contained in the recent calcareous
marl of Scotland, before mentioned, is very small, but the abundance of
individuals extremely great, a circumstance very characteristic of freshwater
formations in general, as compared to marine; for in the latter, as
is seen on sea-beaches, coral-reefs, or in the bottom of the seas examined
by dredging, wherever the individual shells are exceedingly numerous,
there rarely fails to be a vast variety of species.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_770" id="Page_770">770</a></span></p>

<h5><i>Imbedding of the Remains of Marine Plants and Animals.</i></h5>

<p><i>Marine plants.</i>&mdash;The large banks of drift sea-weed which occur on
each side of the equator in the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans, were
before alluded to.<a name="FNanchor_1105" id="FNanchor_1105"></a><a href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a> These, when they subside, may often produce considerable
beds of vegetable matter. In Holland, sub-marine peat is
derived from Fuci, and on parts of our own coast from <i>Zostera marina</i>.
In places where Alg&aelig; do not generate peat, they may nevertheless leave
traces of their form imprinted on argillaceous and calcareous mud, as
they are usually very tough in their texture.</p>

<p>Sea-weeds are often cast up in such abundance on our shores during
heavy gales, that we cannot doubt that occasionally vast numbers of them
are imbedded in littoral deposits now in progress. We learn from the
researches of Dr. Forchhammer, that besides supplying in common with
land plants the materials of coal, the Alg&aelig; must give rise to important
chemical changes in the composition of strata in which they are imbedded.
These plants always contain sulphuric acid, and sometimes in as
large a quantity as 8&frac12; per cent., combined with potash: magnesia also
and phosphoric acid are constant ingredients. Whenever large masses
of sea-weeds putrefy in contact with ferruginous clay, sulphuret of iron,
or iron pyrites, is formed by the union of the sulphur of the plants with
the iron of the clay; while the potash, released from its union with the
clay (<i>i. e.</i> silicate of alumina), forms with it a peculiar compound.
Many of the mineral characteristics of ancient rocks, especially the alum
slates, and the pyrites which occur in clay slate, and the fragments of
anthracite in marine Silurian strata, may be explained by the decomposition
of fucoids or sea-weeds.<a name="FNanchor_1106" id="FNanchor_1106"></a><a href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a></p>

<p><i>Imbedding of cetacea.</i>&mdash;It is not uncommon for the larger Cetacea,
which can float only in a considerable depth of water, to be carried during
storms or high tides into estuaries, or upon low shores, where, upon
the retiring of high water, they are stranded. Thus a narwal (<i>Monodon
monoceros</i>) was found on the beach, near Boston in Lincolnshire, in the
year 1800, the whole of its body buried in the mud. A fisherman going
to his boat saw the horn, and tried to pull it out, when the animal began
to stir itself.<a name="FNanchor_1107" id="FNanchor_1107"></a><a href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a> An individual of the common whale (<i>Bal&aelig;na) mysticetus</i>),
which measured seventy feet, came ashore near Peterhead, in 1682.
Many individuals of the genus Bal&aelig;noptera have met the same fate. It
will be sufficient to refer to those cast on shore near Burnt Island, and
at Alloa, recorded by Sibbald and Neill. The other individual mentioned
by Sibbald, as having come ashore at Boyne, in Banffshire, was probably
a razor-back. Of the genus Catodon (<i>Cachalot</i>), Ray mentions a large
one stranded on the west coast of Holland in 1598, and the fact is also
commemorated in a Dutch engraving of the time of much merit. Sibbald,
too, records that a herd of Cachalots, upwards of 100 in number,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_771" id="Page_771">771</a></span>
were found stranded at Cairston, in Orkney. The dead bodies of the
larger Cetacea are sometimes found floating on the surface of the waters,
as was the case with the immense whale exhibited in London in 1831.
And the carcase of a sea-cow or Lamantine (<i>Halicora</i>) was, in 1785,
cast ashore near Leith.</p>

<p>To some accident of this kind we may refer the position of the skeleton
of a whale, seventy-three feet long, which was found at Airthrey, on the
Forth, near Stirling, imbedded in clay twenty feet higher than the surface
of the highest tide of the river Forth at the present day. From the
situation of the Roman station and causeways at a small distance from
the spot, it is concluded that the whale must have been stranded there at
a period prior to the Christian era.<a name="FNanchor_1108" id="FNanchor_1108"></a><a href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a></p>

<p>Other fossil remains of this class have also been found in estuaries known
to have been silted up in recent times, one example of which has been
already mentioned near Lewes, in Sussex.</p>

<p><i>Marine reptiles.</i>&mdash;Some singular fossils have lately been discovered in
the Island of Ascension, in a stone said to be

<span class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 106.</span><a name="f106" id="f106"></a><img src="images/f106.png" width="200" height="183" alt="Fossil eggs of turtles from the
Island of Ascension." title="" />

<span class="center3">Fossil eggs of turtles from the
Island of Ascension.<a name="FNanchor_1109" id="FNanchor_1109"></a><a href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a></span></span>

continually forming on the beach, where the
waves threw up small rounded fragments of
shells and corals, which, in the course of time,
become firmly agglutinated together, and constitute
a stone used largely for building and
making lime. In a quarry on the N. W. side
of the island, about 100 yards from the sea,
some fossil eggs of turtles have been discovered
in the hard rock thus formed. The eggs
must have been nearly hatched at the time when they perished; for the
bones of the young turtle are seen in the interior, with their shape fully developed,
the interstices between the bones being entirely filled with grains
of sand, which are cemented together, so that when the egg-shells are removed
perfect casts of their form remain in stone. In the single specimen
here figured (<a href="#f106">fig. 106</a>), which is only five inches in its longest diameter,
no less than seven eggs are preserved.<a name="FNanchor_1110" id="FNanchor_1110"></a><a href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a></p>

<p>To explain the state in which they occur fossil, it seems necessary to
suppose that after the eggs were almost hatched in the warm sand, a
great wave threw upon them so much more sand as to prevent the rays
of the sun from penetrating, so that the yolk was chilled and deprived of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_772" id="Page_772">772</a></span>
vitality. The shells were, perhaps, slightly broken at the same time, so
that small grains of sand might gradually be introduced into the interior
by water as it percolated through the beach.</p>

<p><i>Marine testacea.</i>&mdash;The aquatic animals and plants which inhabit an
estuary are liable, like the trees and land animals which people the alluvial
plains of a great river, to be swept from time to time far into the
deep; for as a river is perpetually shifting its course, and undermining a
portion of its banks with the forests which cover them, so the marine
current alters its direction from time to time, and bears away the banks
of sand and mud against which it turns its force. These banks may consist
in great measure of shells peculiar to shallow and sometimes brackish
water, which may have been accumulating for centuries, until at length
they are carried away and spread out along the bottom of the sea, at a
depth at which they could not have lived and multiplied. Thus littoral
and estuary shells are more frequently liable even than freshwater species,
to be intermixed with the exuvi&aelig; of pelagic tribes.</p>

<p>After the storm of February 4, 1831, when several vessels were
wrecked in the estuary of the Forth, the current was directed against a
bed of oysters with such force, that great heaps of them were thrown
<i>alive</i> upon the beach, and remained above high-water mark. I collected
many of these oysters, as also the common eatable whelks (<i>Buccina</i>),
thrown up with them, and observed that, although still living, their
shells were worn by the long attrition of sand which had passed over
them as they lay in their native bed, and which had evidently not resulted
from the mere action of the tempest by which they were cast
ashore.</p>

<p>From these facts we learn that the union of the two parts of a bivalve
shell does not prove that it has not been transported to a distance; and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_773" id="Page_773">773</a></span>
when we find shells worn, and with all their prominent parts rubbed off,
they may still have been imbedded where they grew.</p>

<p><i>Burrowing shells.</i>&mdash;It sometimes appears extraordinary, when we observe
the violence of the breakers on our coast, and see the strength of
the current in removing cliffs, and sweeping out new channels, that many
tender and fragile shells should inhabit the sea in the immediate vicinity
of this turmoil. But a great number of the bivalve Testacea, and many
also of the turbinated univalves, burrow in sand or mud. The Solen
and the Cardium, for example, which are usually found in shallow
water near the shore, pierce through a soft bottom without injury
to their shells; and the Pholas can drill a cavity through mud of considerable
hardness. The species of these and many other tribes can sink,
when alarmed, with considerable rapidity, often to the depth of several
feet, and can also penetrate upwards again to the surface, if a mass of
matter be heaped upon them. The hurricane, therefore, may expend its
fury in vain, and may sweep away even the upper part of banks of sand
or mud, or may roll pebbles over them, and yet these Testacea may remain
below secure and uninjured.</p>

<p><i>Shells become fossil at considerable depths.</i>&mdash;I have already stated
that, at the depth of 950 fathoms, between Gibraltar and Ceuta, Captain
Smith found a gravelly bottom, with fragments of broken shells,
carried thither probably from the comparatively shallow parts of the
neighboring straits, through which a powerful current flows. Beds of
shelly sand might here, in the course of ages, be accumulated several
thousand feet thick. But, without the aid of the drifting power of a
current, shells may accumulate in the spot where they live and die, at
great depths from the surface, if sediment be thrown down upon them;
for even in our own colder latitudes, the depths at which living marine
animals abound is very considerable. Captain Vidal ascertained, by
soundings made off Tory Island, on the northwest coast of Ireland, that
Crustacea, Star-fish, and Testacea occurred at various depths between
fifty and one hundred fathoms; and he drew up Dentalia from the mud
of Galway Bay, in 230 and 240 <i>fathoms</i> water.</p>

<p>The same hydrographer discovered on the Rockhall Bank large quantities
of shells at depths varying from 45 to 190 fathoms. The shells
were for the most part pulverized, and evidently recent, as they retained
their colors. In the same region a bed of fish bones was observed extending
for two miles along the bottom of the sea in eighty and ninety
fathoms water. At the eastern extremity also of Rockhall Bank, fishbones
were met with, mingled with pieces of fresh shell, at the depth of
235 fathoms.</p>

<p>Analogous formations are in progress in the submarine tracts extending
from the Shetland Isles to the north of Ireland, wherever soundings
can be procured. A continuous deposit of sand and mud, replete with
broken and entire shells, Echini, &amp;c., has been traced for upwards of
twenty miles to the eastward of the Faroe Islands, usually at the depth
of from forty to one hundred fathoms. In one part of this tract (lat.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_774" id="Page_774">774</a></span>
61&deg; 50', long. 6&deg; 30') fish-bones occur in extraordinary profusion, so that
the lead cannot be drawn up without some vertebr&aelig; being attached.
This "bone bed," as it was called by our surveyors, is three miles and a
half in length, and forty-five fathoms under water, and contains a few
shells intermingled with the bones.</p>

<p>In the British seas, the shells and other organic remains lie in soft
mud or loose sand and gravel; whereas, in the bed of the Adriatic,
Donati found them frequently inclosed in stone of recent origin. This
is precisely the difference in character which we might have expected to
exist between the British marine formations now in progress and those
of the Adriatic; for calcareous and other mineral springs abound in the
Mediterranean and lands adjoining, while they are almost entirely wanting
in our own country. I have already adverted to the eight regions of
different depths in the &AElig;gean Sea, each characterized by a peculiar assemblage
of shells, which have been described by Professor E. Forbes,
who explored them by dredging. (See above, p. 649.)</p>

<p>During his survey of the west coast of Africa, Captain Sir E. Belcher
found, by frequent soundings between the twenty-third and twentieth degrees
of north latitude, that the bottom of the sea, at the depth of from
twenty to about fifty fathoms, consists of sand with a great intermixture
of shells, often entire, but sometimes finely comminuted. Between the
eleventh and ninth degrees of north latitude, on the same coast, at soundings
varying from twenty to about eighty fathoms, he brought up abundance
of corals and shells mixed with sand. These also were in some
parts entire, and in others worn and broken.</p>

<p>In all these cases, it is only necessary that there should be some deposition
of sedimentary matter, however minute, such as may be supplied
by rivers draining a continent, or currents preying on a line of cliffs, in
order that stratified formations, hundreds of feet in thickness, and replete
with organic remains, should result in the course of ages.</p>

<p>But although some deposits may thus extend continuously for a thousand
miles or more near certain coasts, the greater part of the bed of the
ocean, remote from continents and islands, may very probably receive, at
the same time, no new accessions of drift matter, all sediment being intercepted
by intervening hollows, in which a marine current must clear its
waters as thoroughly as a turbid river in a lake. Erroneous theories in
geology may be formed not only from overlooking the great extent of
simultaneous deposits now in progress, but also from the assumption
that such formations may be universal or coextensive with the bed of
the ocean.</p>

<p>We frequently observe, on the sea beach, very perfect specimens of
fossil shells, quite detached from their matrix, which have been washed
out of older formations, constituting the sea-cliffs. They may be all of
extinct species, like the Eocene freshwater and marine shells strewed over
the shores of Hampshire, yet when they become mingled with the shells
of the present period, and buried in the same deposits of mud and sand,
they would appear, if upraised and examined by future geologists, to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_775" id="Page_775">775</a></span>
have been all of the same age. That such intermixture and blending
of organic remains of different ages have actually taken place in former
times, is unquestionable, though the occurrence appears to be very local
and exceptional. It is, however, a class of accidents more likely than
almost any other to lead to serious anachronisms in geological chronology.</p>

<p>The powers of the organic creation in modifying the form and structure
of the earth's crust, are most conspicuously displayed in the labors of the
coral animals. We may compare the operation of these zoophytes in the
ocean, to the effects produced on a smaller scale upon the land by the
plants which generate peat. In the case of the Sphagnum, the upper
part vegetates while the lower part is entering into a mineral mass, in
which the traces of organization remain when life has entirely ceased.
In corals, in like manner, the more durable materials of the generation
that has passed away serve as the foundation on which the living animals
continue to rear a similar structure.</p>

<p>The stony part of the lamelliform zoophyte may be likened to an
internal skeleton; for it is always more or less surrounded by a soft animal
substance capable of expanding itself; yet, when alarmed, it has the
power of contracting and drawing itself almost entirely into the cells and
hollows of the hard coral. Although oftentimes beautifully colored in
their own element, the soft parts become when taken from the sea
nothing more in appearance than a brown slime spread over the stony
nucleus.<a name="FNanchor_1111" id="FNanchor_1111"></a><a href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a></p>

<p>The growth of those corals which form reefs of solid stone is entirely
confined to the warmer regions of the globe, rarely extending beyond the
tropics above two or three degrees, except under peculiar circumstances,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_776" id="Page_776">776</a></span>
as in the Bermuda Islands, in lat. 32&deg; N., where the Atlantic is warmed
by the Gulf stream. The Pacific Ocean, throughout a space comprehended
between the thirtieth parallels of latitude on each side of the
equator, is extremely productive of coral; as also are the Arabian and
Persian Gulfs. Coral is also abundant in the sea between the coast of
Malabar and the island of Madagascar. Flinders describes a reef of coral
on the east coast of New Holland as having a length of nearly 1000
miles, and as being in one part unbroken for a distance of 350 miles.
Some groups of coral islands in the Pacific are from 1100 to 1200 miles

<span class="figleft" style="width: 300px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 108.</span><a name="f108" id="f108"></a><img src="images/f108.png" width="300" height="240" alt="Meandrina labyrinthica." title="" />

<span class="center3"><i>Meandrina labyrinthica</i>, Lam.</span></span>

in length, by 300 or 400 in breadth,
as the Dangerous Archipelago, for
example, and that called Radack by
Kotzebue; but the islands within
these spaces are always small points,
and often very thinly sown.</p>

<p>Of the numerous species of zoophytes
which are engaged in the
production of coral banks, some of
the most common belong to the
Lamarckian genera Astrea, Porites,
Madrepora, Millepora, Caryophyllia,
and Meandrina.</p>

<p><i>Rate of the growth of Coral.</i>&mdash;Very different opinions have been
entertained in regard to the rate at which coral reefs increase. In
Captain Beechey's late expedition to the Pacific, no positive information
could be obtained of any channel having been filled up within a given
period; and it seems established, that several reefs had remained for
more than half a century, at about the same depth from the surface.</p>

<p>Ehrenberg also questions the fact of channels and harbors having
been closed up in the Red Sea by the rapid increase of coral limestone.
He supposes the notion to have arisen from the circumstance of havens
having been occasionally filled up in some places with coral sand, in
others with large quantities of ballast of coral rock thrown down from
vessels.</p>

<p>The natives of the Bermuda Islands point out certain corals now
growing in the sea, which, according to tradition, have been living in the
same spots for centuries. It is supposed that some of them may vie in
age with the most ancient trees of Europe. Ehrenberg also observed
single corals of the genera Meandrina and Favia, having a globular
form, from six to nine feet in diameter, "which must (he says) be of
immense antiquity, probably several thousand years old, so that Pharaoh
may have looked upon these same individuals in the Red Sea."<a name="FNanchor_1112" id="FNanchor_1112"></a><a href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a> They
certainly imply, as he remarks, that the reef on which they grow has
increased at a very slow rate. After collecting more than 100 species,
he found none of them covered with parasitic zoophytes, nor any
instance of a living coral growing on another living coral. To this
repulsive power which they exert whilst living, against all others of
their own class, we owe the beautiful symmetry of some large Meandrin&aelig;,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_778" id="Page_778">778</a></span>
and other species which adorn our museums. Yet Balani and
Serpul&aelig; can attach themselves to living corals, and holes are excavated
in them by saxicavous mollusca.</p>

<p>At the island called Taaopoto, in the South Pacific, the anchor of a
ship, wrecked about 50 years before, was observed in seven fathoms
water, still preserving its original form, but entirely incrusted by coral.<a name="FNanchor_1113" id="FNanchor_1113"></a><a href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a>
This fact would seem to imply a slow rate of augmentation; but to
form a correct estimate of the average rate must be very difficult, since
it must vary not only according to the species of coral, but according
to the circumstances under which each species may be placed; such, for
example, as the depth from the surface, the quantity of light, the temperature
of the water, its freedom from sand or mud, or the absence or
presence of breakers, which is favorable to the growth of some kinds
and is fatal to that of others. It should also be observed that the
apparent stationary condition of some coral reefs, which according to
Beechey have remained for centuries at the same depth under water,
may be due to subsidence, the upward growth of the coral having been
just sufficient to keep pace with the sinking of the solid foundation on
which the zoophytes have built. We shall afterwards see how far this
hypothesis is borne out by other evidence in the regions of annular
reefs or atolls.</p>

<p>In one of the Maldive islands a coral reef, which, within a few years,
existed on an islet bearing cocoa-nut trees, was found by Lieutenant
Prentice, "<i>entirely covered with live coral and madrepore</i>." The natives
stated that the islet had been washed away by a change in the currents,
and it is clear that a coating of growing coral had been formed in a
short time.<a name="FNanchor_1114" id="FNanchor_1114"></a><a href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a> Experiments, also, of Dr. Allan, on the east coast of
Madagascar, prove the possibility of coral growing to a thickness of
three feet in about half a year,<a name="FNanchor_1115" id="FNanchor_1115"></a><a href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a> so that the rate of increase may, under
favorable circumstances, be very far from slow.</p>

<p>It must not be supposed that the calcareous masses termed coral
reefs are exclusively the work of zoophytes: a great variety of shells,
and, among them, some of the largest and heaviest of known species,
contribute to augment the mass. In the South Pacific, great beds of
oysters, mussels, <i>Pinn&aelig; marin&aelig;</i>, <i>Cham&oelig;</i> (or <i>Tridacn&aelig;</i>), and other
shells, cover in profusion almost every reef; and on the beach of coral
islands are seen the shells of echini and broken fragments of crustaceous
animals. Large shoals of fish are also discernible through the clear
blue water, and their teeth and hard palates cannot fail to be often
preserved although their soft cartilaginous bones may decay.</p>

<p>It was the opinion of the German naturalist Forster, in 1780, after his
voyage round the world with Captain Cook, that coral animals had the
power of building up steep and almost perpendicular walls from great
depths in the sea, a notion afterwards adopted by Captain Flinders and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_779" id="Page_779">779</a></span>
others; but it is now very generally believed that these zoophytes cannot
live in water of great depths.</p>

<p>Mr. Darwin has come to the conclusion, that those species which are
most effective in the construction of reefs, rarely flourish at a greater
depth than 20 fathoms, or 120 feet. In some lagoons, however, where
the water is but little agitated, there are, according to Kotzebue, beds of
living coral in 25 fathoms of water, or 150 feet; but these may perhaps
have begun to live in shallower water, and may have been carried downwards
by the subsidence of the reef. There are also various species of
zoophytes, and among them some which are provided with calcareous as
well as horny stems, which live in much deeper water, even in some cases
to a depth of 180 fathoms; but these do not appear to give origin to
stony reefs.</p>

<p>There is every variety of form in coral reefs, but the most remarkable
and numerous in the Pacific consist of circular or oval strips of dry land,
enclosing a shallow lake or lagoon of still water, in which zoophytes and
mollusca abound. These annular reefs just raise themselves above the
level of the sea, and are surrounded by a deep and often unfathomable
ocean.</p>

<p>In the annexed cut (<a href="#f114">fig. 114</a>), one of these circular islands is represented,
just rising above the waves, covered with the cocoa-nut and
other trees, and inclosing within a lagoon of tranquil water.</p>

<p>Of thirty-two of these coral islands visited by Beechey in his voyage
to the Pacific, twenty-nine had lagoons in their centres. The largest was
30 miles in diameter, and the smallest less than a mile. All were
increasing their dimensions by the active operations of the lithophytes,
which appeared to be gradually extending and bringing the immersed
parts of their structure to the surface. The scene presented by these
annular reefs is equally striking for its singularity and beauty. A strip
of land a few hundred yards wide is covered by lofty cocoa-nut trees,
above which is the blue vault of heaven. This band of verdure is
bounded by a beach of glittering white sand, the outer margin of which
is encircled with a ring of snow-white breakers, beyond which are the dark
heaving waters of the ocean. The inner beach incloses the still clear
water of the lagoon, resting in its greater part on white sand, and when
illuminated by a vertical sun, of a most vivid green.<a name="FNanchor_1117" id="FNanchor_1117"></a><a href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a> Certain species
of zoophytes abound most in the lagoon, others on the exterior margin,
where there is a great surf. "The ocean," says Mr. Darwin, "throwing
its breakers on these outer shores, appears an invincible enemy, yet we
see it resisted and even conquered by means which at first seem most
weak and inefficient. No periods of repose are granted, and the long
swell caused by the steady action of the trade wind never ceases. The
breakers exceed in violence those of our temperate regions, and it is
impossible to behold them without feeling a conviction that rocks of granite
or quartz would ultimately yield and be demolished by such irresistible
forces. Yet these low insignificant coral islets stand and are
victorious, for here another power, as antagonist to the former, takes part
in the contest. The organic forces separate the atoms of carbonate of
lime one by one from the foaming breakers, and unite them into a symmetrical
structure; myriads of architects are at work night and day,
month after month, and we see their soft and gelatinous bodies through
the agency of the vital laws conquering the great mechanical power of
the waves of an ocean, which neither the art of man, nor the inanimate
works of nature could successfully resist."<a name="FNanchor_1118" id="FNanchor_1118"></a><a href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_781" id="Page_781">781</a></span>
As the coral animals require to be continually immersed in salt water,
they cannot raise themselves by their own efforts, above the level of the
lowest tides. The manner in which the reefs are converted into islands
above the level of the sea is thus described by Chamisso, a naturalist,
who accompanied Kotzebue in his voyages:&mdash;"When the reef," says he,
"is of such a height that it remains almost dry at low water the corals
leave off building. Above this line a continuous mass of solid stone is
seen composed of the shells of mollusks and echini, with their broken-off
prickles and fragments of coral, united by calcareous sand, produced by
the pulverization of shells. The heat of the sun often penetrates the
mass of stone when it is dry, so that it splits in many places, and the
force of the waves is thereby enabled to separate and lift blocks of coral,
frequently six feet long and three or four in thickness, and throw them
upon the reef, by which means the ridge becomes at length so high that
it is covered only during some seasons of the year by the spring tides.
After this the calcareous sand lies undisturbed, and offers to the seeds
of trees and plants cast upon it by the waves a soil upon which they
rapidly grow, to overshadow its dazzling white surface. Entire trunks
of trees, which are carried by the rivers from other countries and islands,
find here, at length, a resting-place after their long wanderings: with
these come some small animals such as insects and lizards, as the first
inhabitants. Even before the trees form a wood, the sea-birds nestle here;
stray land-birds take refuge in the bushes; and, at a much later period,
when the work has been long since completed, man appears and builds
his hut on the fruitful soil."<a name="FNanchor_1119" id="FNanchor_1119"></a><a href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor">1119</a></p>

<p>In the above description the solid stone is stated to consist of shell and
coral, united by sand; but masses of very compact limestone are also
found even in the uppermost and newest parts of the reef, such as could
only have been produced by chemical precipitation. Professor Agassiz
also informs me that his observations on the Florida reefs (which confirm
Darwin's theory of atolls to be mentioned in the sequel) have convinced
him, that large blocks are loosened, not by shrinkage in the sun's heat,
as Chamisso imagined, but by innumerable perforations of lithodomi and
other boring testacea.</p>

<p>The carbonate of lime may have been principally derived from the
decomposition of corals and testacea; for when the animal matter undergoes
putrefaction, the calcareous residuum must be set free under circumstances
very favorable to precipitation, especially when there are other
calcareous substances, such as shells and corals, on which it may be deposited.
Thus organic bodies may be inclosed in a solid cement, and
become portions of rocky masses.<a name="FNanchor_1120" id="FNanchor_1120"></a><a href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor">1120</a></p>

<p>The width of the circular strip of dead coral forming the islands explored
by Captain Beechey, exceeded in no instance half a mile from the
usual wash of the sea to the edge of the lagoon, and, in general, was
only about three or four hundred yards.<a name="FNanchor_1121" id="FNanchor_1121"></a><a href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor">1121</a> The depth of the lagoons is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_782" id="Page_782">782</a></span>
various; in some, entered by Captain Beechey, it was from twenty to
thirty-eight fathoms.</p>

<p>The two other peculiarities which are most characteristic of the annular

<span class="figright" style="width: 225px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 117.</span><a name="f117" id="f117"></a><img src="images/f117.png" width="225" height="913" alt="Section of part of a Coral Island." title="" />

<span class="center3">Section of part of a Coral Island.</span></span>

reef or atoll are first, that the strip of dead
coral is invariably highest on the windward
side, and secondly, that there is very generally
an opening at some point in the reef affording
a narrow passage, often of considerable
depth, from the sea into the lagoon.</p>

<p><i>Maldive and Laccadive Isles.</i>&mdash;The chain
of reefs and islets called the Maldives (see
<a href="#f117">fig. 117</a>.), situated in the Indian Ocean, to
the south-west of Malabar, forms a chain
470 geographical miles in length, running
due north and south, with an average breadth
of about 50 miles. It is composed throughout
of a series of circular assemblages of
islets, all formed of coral, the larger groups
being from forty to ninety miles in their
longest diameter. Captain Horsburgh, whose
chart of these islands is subjoined, states, that
outside of each circle or <i>atoll</i>, as it is termed,
there are coral reefs sometimes extending to
the distance of two or three miles, beyond
which there are no soundings at immense
depths. But in the centre of each atoll there
is a lagoon from fifteen to forty-nine fathoms
deep. In the channels between the atolls no
soundings can usually be obtained at the
depth of 150 or even 250 fathoms, but during
Captain Moresby's survey, soundings were
struck at 150 and 200 fathoms, the only instances
as yet known of the bottom having
been reached, either in the Indian or Pacific
oceans, in a space intervening between two
separate and well characterized atolls.</p>

<p>The singularity in the form of the atolls
of this archipelago consists in their being
made up, not of one continuous circular reef
but of a ring of small coral islets sometimes
more than a hundred in number, each
of which is a miniature atoll in itself; in other words, a ring-shaped strip
of coral surrounding a lagoon of salt water. To account for the origin
of these, Mr. Darwin supposes the larger annular reef to have been broken
up into a number of fragments, each of which acquired its peculiar configurations
under the influence of causes similar to those to which the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_783" id="Page_783">783</a></span>
structure of the parent atoll has been due. Many of the minor rings are
no less than three, and even five miles in diameter, and some are situated
in the midst of the principal lagoon; but this happens only in cases
where the sea can enter freely through breaches in the outer or marginal
reef.</p>

<p>The rocks of the Maldives are composed of sandstone formed of broken
shells and corals, such as may be obtained in a loose state from the beach,
and which is seen when exposed for a few days to the air to become hardened.
The sandstone is sometimes observed to be an aggregate of broken
shells, corals, pieces of wood, and shells of the cocoa-nut.<a name="FNanchor_1122" id="FNanchor_1122"></a><a href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor">1122</a></p>

<p>The Laccadive islands run in the same line with the Maldives, on the
north, as do the isles of the Chagos Archipelago, on the south; so that
these may be continuations of the same chain of submerged mountains,
crested in a similar manner by coral limestones.</p>

<p><i>Origin of the circular form&mdash;not volcanic.</i>&mdash;The circular and oval
shape of so many reefs, each having a lagoon in the centre, and being
surrounded on all sides by a deep ocean, naturally suggested the idea that
they were nothing more than the crests of submarine volcanic craters
overgrown by coral; and this theory I myself advocated in the earlier
editions of this work. Although I am now about to show that it must
be abandoned, it may still be instructive to point out the grounds on
which it was formerly embraced. In the first place, it had been remarked
that there were many active volcanoes in the coral region of the Pacific,
and that in some places, as in Gambier's group, rocks composed of porous
lava rise up in a lagoon bordered by a circular reef, just as the two cones
of eruption called the Kamenis have made their appearance in the times
of history within the circular gulf of Santorin.<a name="FNanchor_1123" id="FNanchor_1123"></a><a href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor">1123</a> It was also observed that,
as in S. Shetland, Barren Island, and others of volcanic origin, there is
one narrow breach in the walls of the outer cone by which ships may
enter a circular gulf, so in like manner there is often a single deep passage
leading into the lagoon of a coral island, the lagoon itself seeming to
represent the hollow or gulf just as the ring of dry coral recalls to our
minds the rim of a volcanic crater. More lately, indeed, Mr. Darwin has
shown that the numerous volcanic craters of the Galapagos Archipelago
in the Pacific have all of them their southern sides the lowest, or in many
cases quite broken down, so that if they were submerged and incrusted
with coral, they would resemble true atolls in shape.<a name="FNanchor_1124" id="FNanchor_1124"></a><a href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor">1124</a></p>

<p>Another argument which I adduced when formerly defending this doctrine
was derived from Ehrenberg's statement, that some banks of coral
in the Red Sea were square, while many others were ribbon-like strips,
with flat tops, and without lagoons. Since, therefore, all the genera and
many of the species of zoophytes in the Red Sea agreed with those which
elsewhere construct lagoon islands, it followed that the stone-making
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_784" id="Page_784">784</a></span>
zoophytes are not guided by their own instinct in the formation of annular
reefs, but that this peculiar shape and the position of such reefs in the
midst of a deep ocean must depend on the outline of the submarine
bottom, which resembles nothing else in nature but the crater of a
lofty submerged volcanic cone. The enormous size, it is true, of some
atolls, made it necessary for me to ascribe to the craters of many submarine
volcanoes a magnitude which was startling, and which had often
been appealed to as a serious objection to the volcanic theory. That so
many of them were of the same height, or just level with the water, did
not present a difficulty so long as we remained ignorant of the fact that
the reef-building species do not grow at greater depths than
twenty-five fathoms.</p>

<p><i>May be explained by subsidence.</i>&mdash;Mr. Darwin, after examining a
variety of coral formations in different parts of the globe, was induced
to reject the opinion that their shape represented the form of the original
bottom. Instead of admitting that the ring of dead coral rested on a
circular or oval ridge of rock, or that the lagoon corresponded to a preexisting
cavity, he advanced a new opinion, which must, at first sight,
seem paradoxical in the extreme; namely, that the lagoon is precisely in
the place once occupied by the highest part of a mountainous island, or,
in other cases, by the top of a shoal.</p>

<p>The following is a brief sketch of the facts and arguments in favor of
this new view:&mdash;Besides those rings of dry coral which enclose lagoons, there
are others having a similar form and structure which encircle lofty islands.
Of the latter kind is Vanikoro, (see map, <a href="#f39">fig. 39</a>, p. 351,) celebrated on
account of the shipwreck of La Peyrouse, where the coral reef runs at
the distance of two or three miles from the shore, the channel between it
and the land having a general depth of between 200 and 300 feet. This
channel, therefore, is analogous to a lagoon, but with an island standing
in the middle like a picture in its frame. In like manner in Tahiti we
see a mountainous land, with everywhere round its margin a lake or
zone of smooth salt water, separated from the ocean by an encircling
reef of coral, on which a line of breakers is always foaming. So also
New Caledonia, a long narrow island east of New Holland, in which the
rocks are granitic, is surrounded by a reef which runs for a length of 400
miles. This reef encompasses not only the island itself, but a ridge of
rocks which are prolonged in the same direction beneath the sea. No
one, therefore, will contend for a moment that in this case the corals are
based upon the rim of a volcanic crater, in the middle of which stands a
mountain or island of granite.</p>

<p>The great barrier reef, already mentioned as running parallel to the
north-east coast of Australia for nearly 1000 miles, is another most remarkable
example of a long strip of coral running parallel to a coast. Its
distance from the mainland varies from twenty to seventy miles, and the
depth of the great arm of the sea thus enclosed is usually between ten
and twenty fathoms, but towards one end from forty to sixty. This great
reef would extend much farther, according to Mr. Jukes, if the growth of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_785" id="Page_785">785</a></span>
coral were not prevented off the shores of New Guinea by a muddy bottom,
caused by rivers charged with sediment which flow from the
southern coast of that great island.<a name="FNanchor_1125" id="FNanchor_1125"></a><a href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor">1125</a></p>

<p>Two classes of reefs, therefore, have now been considered; first, the
atoll, and, secondly, the encircling and barrier reef, all agreeing perfectly
in structure, and the sole difference lying in the absence in the case of the
atoll of all land, and in the others the presence of land bounded either
by an encircling or a barrier reef. But there is still a third class of reefs,
called by Mr. Darwin "fringing reefs," which approach much nearer the
land than those of the encircling and barrier class, and which indeed so
nearly touched the coast as to leave nothing in the intervening space
resembling a lagoon. "That these reefs are not attached quite close to
the shore appears to be the result of two causes; first, that the water
immediately adjoining the beach is rendered turbid by the surf, and therefore
injurious to all zoophytes; and, secondly, that the larger and efficient
kinds only flourish on the outer edge amidst the breakers of the open
sea."<a name="FNanchor_1126" id="FNanchor_1126"></a><a href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor">1126</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 118.</span><a name="f118" id="f118"></a><img src="images/f118.png" width="450" height="184" alt="Supposed section of an island with an encircling reef of coral." title="" />

<p class="center2">Supposed section of an island with an encircling reef of coral.</p>

<p class="small">A, The island.</p>
<p class="small"><i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, Highest points of the encircling reef between which and the coast is seen a space
occupied by still water.</p></div>

<p>It will at once be conceded that there is so much analogy between the
form and position of the strip of coral in the atoll, and in the encircling
and barrier reef, that no explanation can be satisfactory which does not
include the whole. If we turn in the first place to the encircling and
barrier reefs, and endeavor to explain how the zoophytes could have
found a bottom on which to begin to build, we are met at once with a
great difficulty. It is a general fact, long since remarked by Dampier,
that high land and deep seas go together. In other words, steep
mountains coming down abruptly to the sea-shore are generally continued
with the same slope beneath the water. But where the reef, as at <i>b</i> and
<i>c</i> (<a href="#f118">fig. 118</a>), is distant several miles from a steep coast, a line drawn perpendicularly
downwards from its outer edges <i>b c</i> to the fundamental rock
<i>d e</i>, must descend to a depth exceeding by several thousand feet the
limits at which the efficient stone-building corals can exist, for we have
seen that they cease to grow in water which is more than 120 feet deep.
That the original root immediately beneath the points <i>b c</i> is actually as
far from the surface as <i>d e</i>, is not merely inferred from Dampier's rule,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_786" id="Page_786">786</a></span>
but confirmed by the fact, that, immediately outside the reef, soundings
are either not met with at all, or only at enormous depths. In short, the
ocean is as deep there as might have been anticipated in the neighborhood
of a bold coast; and it is obviously the presence of the coral alone
which has given rise to the anomalous existence of shallow water on the
reef and between it and the land.</p>

<p>After studying in minute detail all the phenomena above described,
Mr. Darwin has offered in explanation a theory now very generally
adopted. The coral-forming polypi, he states, begin to build in water of
a moderate depth, and while they are yet at work, the bottom of the
sea subsides gradually, so that the foundation of their edifice is carried
downwards at the same time that they are raising the superstructure.
If, therefore, the rate of subsidence be not too rapid, the growing coral
will continue to build up to the surface; the mass always gaining in
height above its original base, but remaining in other respects in the
same position. Not so with the land; each inch lost is irreclaimably
gone; as it sinks, the water gains foot by foot on the shore, till in many
cases the highest peak of the original island disappears. What was
before land is then occupied by the lagoon, the position of the encircling
coral remaining unaltered, with the exception of a slight contraction of
its dimensions.</p>

<p>In this manner are encircling reefs and atolls produced; and in confirmation
of his views Mr. Darwin has pointed out examples which illustrate
every intermediate state, from that of lofty islands, such as Otaheite,
encircled by coral, to that of Gambier's group, where a few peaks only
of land rise out of a lagoon, and lastly, to the perfect atoll, having a
lagoon several hundred feet deep, surrounded by a reef rising steeply
from an unfathomed ocean.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 450px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 119.</span><a name="f119" id="f119"></a><img src="images/f119.png" width="450" height="144" alt="Regions of growing coral." title="" /></div>

<p>If we embrace these views, it is clear, that in regions of growing coral
a similar subsidence must give rise to barrier reefs along the shores of
a continent. Thus suppose A (<a href="#f119">fig. 119</a>), to represent the north-east
portion of Australia, and <i>b c</i> the ancient level of the sea, when the coral
reef <i>d</i> was formed. If the land sink so that it is submerged more and
more, the sea must at length stand at the level <i>e f</i>, the reef in the mean
time having been enlarged and raised to the point <i>g</i>. The distance
between the shore <i>f</i>, and the barrier reef <i>g</i>, is now much greater than
originally between the shore <i>c</i> and the reef <i>d</i>, and the longer the subsidence
continues the farther will the coast of the mainland recede.</p>

<p>When the first edition of this work appeared in 1831, several years
before Mr. Darwin had investigated the facts on which his theory is
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_787" id="Page_787">787</a></span>
founded, I had come to the opinion that the land was subsiding at the
bottom of those parts of the Pacific where atolls are numerous, although
I failed to perceive that such a subsidence, if conceded, would equally
solve the enigma as to the form both of annular and barrier reefs.</p>

<p>I shall cite the passage referred to, as published by me in 1831:&mdash;"It
is a remarkable circumstance that there should be so vast an area in
Eastern Oceanica, studded with minute islands, without one single spot
where there is a wider extent of land than belongs to such islands as
Otaheite, Owhyhee, and a few others, which either have been or are still
the seats of active volcanoes. If an equilibrium only were maintained between
the upheaving and depressing force of earthquakes, large islands
would very soon be formed in the Pacific; for, in that case, the growth
of limestone, the flowing of lava, and the ejection of volcanic ashes, would
combine with the upheaving force to form new land.</p>

<p>"Suppose a shoal, 600 miles in length, to sink fifteen feet, and then to
remain unmoved for a thousand years; during that interval the growing
coral may again approach the surface. Then let the mass be re-elevated
fifteen feet, so that the original reef is restored to its former position: in
this case, the new coral formed since the first subsidence will constitute
an island 600 miles long. An analogous result would have occurred if
a lava-current fifteen feet thick had overflowed the submerged reef. The
absence, therefore, of more extensive tracts of land in the Pacific,
seems to show that the amount of subsidence by earthquakes exceeds,
in that quarter of the globe, at present, the elevation due to the same
cause."<a name="FNanchor_1127" id="FNanchor_1127"></a><a href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor">1127</a></p>

<p>Another proof also of subsidence derived from the structure of atolls,
was pointed out by me in the following passage in all former editions.
"The low coral islands of the Pacific," says Captain Beechey, "follow
one general rule in having their windward side higher and more perfect
than the other. At Gambia and Matilda islands this inequality is very
conspicuous, the weather side of both being wooded, and of the former
inhabited, while the other sides are from twenty to thirty feet under
water; where, however, they may be perceived to be equally <i>narrow</i> and
well defined. It is on the leeward side also that the entrances into the
lagoons occur; and although they may sometimes be situated on a side
that runs in the direction of the wind, as at Bow Island, yet there are
none to windward." These observations of Captain Beechey accord with
those which Captain Horsburgh and other hydrographers have made in
regard to the coral islands of other seas. From this fortunate circumstance
ships can enter and sail out with ease; whereas if the narrow inlets
were to windward, vessels which once entered might not succeed for
months in making their way out again. The well-known security of
many of these harbors depends entirely on this fortunate peculiarity in
their structure.</p>

<p>"In what manner is this singular conformation to be accounted for?
The action of the waves is seen to be the cause of the superior elevation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_788" id="Page_788">788</a></span>
of some reefs on their windward sides, where sand and large masses of
coral rock are thrown up by the breakers; but there is a variety of cases
where this cause alone is inadequate to solve the problem; for reefs submerged
at considerable depths, where the movements of the sea cannot
exert much power, have, nevertheless, the same conformation, the leeward
being much lower than the windward side.<a name="FNanchor_1128" id="FNanchor_1128"></a><a href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor">1128</a></p>

<p>"I am informed by Captain King, that, on examining the reefs called
Rowley Shoals, which lie off the north-west coast of Australia, where the
east and west monsoons prevail alternately, he found the open side of one
crescent-shaped reef, the Imp&eacute;rieuse, turned to the east, and of another,
the Mermaid, turned to the west; while a third oval reef, of the same
group, was entirely submerged. This want of conformity is exactly what
we should expect, where the winds vary periodically.</p>

<p>"It seems impossible to refer the phenomenon now under consideration
to any original uniformity in the configuration of submarine volcanoes, on
the summits of which we may suppose the coral reefs to grow; for although
it is very common for craters to be broken down on one side
only, we cannot imagine any cause that should breach them all in the
same direction. But the difficulty will, perhaps, be removed, if we call
in another part of the volcanic agency&mdash;subsidence by earthquakes.
Suppose the windward barrier to have been raised by the mechanical
action of the waves to the height of two or three yards above the wall
on the leeward side, and then the whole island to sink down a few
fathoms, the appearances described would then be presented by the
submerged reef. A repetition of such operations, by the alternate elevation
and depression of the same mass (an hypothesis strictly conformable
to analogy), might produce still greater inequality in the two sides,
especially as the violent efflux of the tide has probably a strong tendency
to check the accumulation of the more tender corals on the leeward
reef; while the action of the breakers contributes to raise the
windward barrier."<a name="FNanchor_1129" id="FNanchor_1129"></a><a href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor">1129</a></p>

<p>Previously to my adverting to the signs above enumerated of a downward
movement in the bed of the ocean, Dr. MacCulloch, Captain
Beechey, and many other writers, had shown that masses of recent coral
had been laid dry at various heights above the sea-level, both in the Red
Sea, the islands of the Pacific, and in the East and West Indies. After
describing thirty-two coral islands in the Pacific, Captain Beechey mentioned
that they were all formed of living coral except one, which, although
of coral formation, was raised about seventy or eighty feet above the
level of the sea, and was encompassed by a reef of living coral. It is
called Elizabeth or Henderson's Island, and is five miles in length by one
in breadth. It has a flat surface, and, on all sides, except the north, is
bounded by perpendicular cliffs about fifty feet high, composed entirely
of dead coral, more or less porous, honey-combed at the surface, and hardening
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_789" id="Page_789">789</a></span>
into a compact calcareous mass, which possesses the fracture
of secondary limestone, and has a species of millepore interspersed through
it. These cliffs are considerably undermined by the action of the waves,
and some of them appear on the eve of precipitating their superincumbent
weight into the sea. Those which are less injured in this way present
no alternate ridges or indication of the different levels which the sea
might have occupied at different periods; but a smooth surface, as if the
island, which has probably been raised by volcanic agency, had been
forced up by one great subterraneous convulsion.<a name="FNanchor_1130" id="FNanchor_1130"></a><a href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor">1130</a> At the distance of a
few hundred yards from this island, no bottom could be gained with
200 fathoms of line.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 550px;"><span class="center2">Fig. 120.</span><a name="f120" id="f120"></a><img src="images/f120.png" width="550" height="80" alt="Elizabeth, or Henderson's Island." title="" />

<p class="center2">Elizabeth, or Henderson's Island.</p></div>

<p>It will be seen, from the annexed sketch, communicated to me by
Lieutenant Smith, of the Blossom, that the trees came down to the beach
towards the centre of the island; a break at first sight resembling the
openings which usually lead into lagoons; but the trees stand on a steep
slope, and no hollow of an ancient lagoon was perceived.</p>

<p>Beechey also remarks, that the surface of Henderson's Island is flat,
and that in Queen Charlotte's Island, one of the same group, but under
water, there was no lagoon, the coral having grown up everywhere to
one level. The probable cause of this obliteration of the central basin
or lagoon will be considered in the sequel.</p>

<p>That the bed of the Pacific and Indian oceans, where atolls are frequent,
must have been sinking for ages, might be inferred, says Mr. Darwin,
from simply reflecting on two facts; first, that the efficient coral-building
zoophytes do not flourish in the ocean at a greater depth than 120 feet;
and, secondly, that there are spaces occupying areas of many hundred thousand
square miles, where all the islands consist of coral, and yet none
of which rise to a greater height than may be accounted for by the action
of the winds and waves on broken and triturated coral. Were we
to take for granted that the floor of the ocean had remained stationary
from the time when the coral began to grow, we should be compelled to
assume that an incredible number of submarine mountains of vast height
(for the ocean is always deep, and often unfathomable between the different
atolls) had all come to within 120 feet of the surface, and yet no
one mountain had risen above water. But no sooner do we admit the
theory of subsidence, than this great, difficulty vanishes. However
varied may have been the altitude of different islands, or the separate
peaks of particular mountain-chains, all may have been reduced to one
uniform level by the gradual submergence of the loftiest points, and the
additions made to the calcareous cappings of the less elevated summits
as they subsided to great depths.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_790" id="Page_790">790</a></span>
<i>Openings into the lagoons.</i>&mdash;In the general description of atolls and
encircling reefs, it was mentioned that there is almost always a deep narrow
passage opening into the lagoon, or into the still water between the
reef and the shore, which is kept open by the efflux of the sea as the
tide goes down.</p>

<p>The origin of this channel must, according to the theory of subsidence
before explained, be traced back to causes which were in action during
the existence of the encircling reef, and when an island or mountain-top
rose within it, for such a reef precedes the atoll in the order of formation.
Now in those islands in the Pacific, which are large enough to
feed small rivers, there is generally an opening or channel in the surrounding
coral reef at the point where the stream of fresh water enters
the sea. The depth of these channels rarely exceeds twenty-five feet;
and they may be attributed, says Captain Beechey, to the aversion of
the lithophytes to fresh water, and to the probable absence of the mineral
matter of which they construct their habitations.<a name="FNanchor_1131" id="FNanchor_1131"></a><a href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor">1131</a></p>

<p>Mr. Darwin, however, has shown, that mud at the bottom of river-courses
is far more influential than the freshness of the water in preventing
the growth of the polypi, for the walls which inclose the openings
are perpendicular, and do not slant off gradually, as would be the
case, if the nature of the element presented the only obstacle to the
increase of the coral-building animals.</p>

<p>When a breach has thus been made in the reef, it will be prevented
from closing up by the efflux of the sea at low tides; for it is sufficient
that a reef should rise a few feet above low-water mark to cause the
waters to collect in the lagoon at high tide, and when the sea falls, to
rush out at one or more points where the reef happens to be lowest or
weakest. This event is strictly analogous to that witnessed in our estuaries,
where a body of salt water accumulated during the flow issues with
great velocity at the ebb of the tide, and scours out or keeps open a deep
passage through the bar, which is almost always formed at the mouth of
a river. At first there are probably many openings, but the growth of
the coral tends to obstruct all those which do not serve as the principal
channels of discharge; so that their number is gradually reduced to a
few, and often finally to one. The fact observed universally, that the
principal opening fronts a considerable valley in the encircled island, between
the shores of which and the outer reef there is often deep water,
scarcely leaves any doubt as to the real origin of the channel in all those
countless atolls where the nucleus of land has vanished.</p>

<p><i>Size of atolls and barrier reefs.</i>&mdash;In regard to the dimensions of
atolls, it was stated that some of the smallest observed by Beechey in
the Pacific were only a mile in diameter. If their external slope under
water equals upon an average an angle of 45&deg;, then would such an atoll
at the depth of half a mile, or 2640 feet, have a diameter of two miles.
Hence it would appear that there must be a tendency in every atoll to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_791" id="Page_791">791</a></span>
grow smaller, except in those cases where oscillations of level enlarge the
base on which the coral grows by throwing down a talus of detrital
matter all round the original cone of limestone.</p>

<p>Bow Island is described by Captain Beechey as seventy miles in circumference,
and thirty in its greatest diameter, but we have seen that
some of the Maldives are much larger.</p>

<p>As the shore of an island or continent which is subsiding will recede from
a coral reef at a slow or rapid rate according as the surface of the land
has a steep or gentle slope, we cannot measure the thickness of the coral
by its distance from the coast; yet, as a general rule, those reefs which
are farthest from the land imply the greatest amount of subsidence. We
learn from Flinders, that the barrier reef of north-eastern Australia is in
some places seventy miles from the mainland, and it should seem that a
calcareous formation is there in progress 1000 miles long from north to
south, with a breadth varying from twenty to seventy miles. It may not,
indeed, be continuous over this vast area, for doubtless innumerable islands
have been submerged one after another between the reef and mainland,
like some which still remain, as, for example, Murray's Islands, lat. 9&deg;
54' S. We are also told that some parts of the gulf inclosed within a
barrier are 400 feet deep, so that the efficient rock-building corals cannot
be growing there, and in other parts of it islands appear encircled by
reefs.</p>

<p>It will follow as one of the consequences of the theory already explained
that, provided the bottom of the sea does not sink too fast to allow
the zoophytes to build upwards at the same pace, the thickness of coral
will be great in proportion to the rapidity of subsidence, so that if one
area sinks two feet while another sinks one, the mass of coral in the first
area will be double that in the second. But the downward movement
must in general have been very slow and uniform, or where intermittent,
must have consisted of a great number of depressions, each of slight
amount, otherwise the bottom of the sea would have been carried down
faster than the corals could build upwards, and the island or continent
would be permanently submerged, having reached a depth of 120 or 150
feet, at which the effective reef-constructing zoophytes cease to live. If,
then, the subsidence required to account for all the existing atolls must
have amounted to three or four thousand feet, or even sometimes more,
we are brought to the conclusion that there has been a <i>slow</i> and <i>gradual</i>
sinking to this enormous extent. Such an inference is perfectly in harmony
with views which the grand scale of denudation, everywhere
observable in the older rocks, has led geologists to adopt in reference to
upward movements. They must also have been gradual and continuous
throughout indefinite ages to allow the waves and currents of the ocean
to operate with adequate power.</p>

<p>The map constructed by Mr. Darwin to display at one view the geographical
position of all the coral reefs throughout the globe is of the
highest geological interest (see above, p. <a href="#Page_351">351</a>.), leading to splendid
generalizations, when we have once embraced the theory that all atolls
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_792" id="Page_792">792</a></span>
and barrier reefs indicate recent subsidence, while the presence of fringing
reefs proves the land to be stationary or rising. These two classes of
coral formations are depicted by different colors; and one of the striking
facts brought to light by the same classification of coral formations is the
absence of active volcanoes in the areas of subsidence, and their frequent
presence in the areas of elevation. The only supposed exception to this
remarkable coincidence at the time when Mr. Darwin wrote, in 1842, was
the volcano of Torres Strait, at the northern point of Australia, placed on
the borders of an area of subsidence; but it has been since proved that
this volcano has no existence.</p>

<p>We see, therefore, an evident connection, first, between the bursting
forth every now and then of volcanic matter through rents and fissures,
and the expansion or forcing outwards of the earth's crust, and, secondly,
between a dormant and less energetic development of subterranean heat,
and an amount of subsidence sufficiently great to cause mountains to
disappear over the broad face of the ocean, leaving only small and
scattered lagoon islands, or groups of atolls, to indicate the spots where
those mountains once stood.</p>

<p>On a review of the differently-colored reefs on the map alluded to, it
will be seen that there are large spaces in which upheaval, and others in
which depression prevails, and these are placed alternately, while there
are a few smaller areas where movements of oscillation occur. Thus if
we commence with the western shores of South America, between the
summit of the Andes and the Pacific (a region of earthquakes and active
volcanoes), we find signs of recent elevation, not attested indeed by coral
formations, which are wanting there, but by upraised banks of marine
shells. Then proceeding westward, we traverse a deep ocean without
islands, until we come to a band of <i>atolls</i> and encircled islands, including
the Dangerous and Society archipelagoes, and constituting an area of subsidence
more than 4000 miles long and 600 broad. Still farther, in the
same direction, we reach the chain of islands to which the New Hebrides,
Salomon, and New Ireland belong, where fringing reefs and masses of
elevated coral indicate another area of upheaval. Again, to the westward
of the New Hebrides we meet with the encircling reef of New Caledonia
and the great Australian barrier, implying a second area of subsidence.</p>

<p>The only objection deserving attention which has hitherto been
advanced against the theory of atolls, as before explained (p. 759.), is
that proposed by Mr. Maclaren.<a name="FNanchor_1132" id="FNanchor_1132"></a><a href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor">1132</a> "On the outside," he observes, "of
coral reefs very highly inclined, no bottom is sometimes found with a line
of 2000 or 3000 feet, and this is by no means a rare case. It follows
that the reef ought to have this thickness; and Mr. Darwin's diagrams
show that he understood it so. Now, if such masses of coral exist under
the sea, they ought somewhere to be found on <i>terra firma</i>; for there is
evidence that all the lands yet visited by geologists, have been at one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_793" id="Page_793">793</a></span>
time submerged. But neither in the great volcanic chain, extending
from Sumatra to Japan, nor in the West Indies, nor in any other region
yet explored, has a bed or formation of coral even 500 feet thick been
discovered, so far as we know."</p>

<p>When considering this objection, it is evident that the first question
we have to deal with is, whether geologists have not already discovered
calcareous masses of the required thickness and structure, or precisely
such as the upheaval of atolls might be expected to expose to view?
We are called upon, in short, to make up our minds both as to the internal
composition of the rocks that must result from the growth of corals,
whether in lagoon islands or barrier reefs, and the external shape which
the reefs would retain when upraised gradually to a vast height,&mdash;a task
by no means so easy as some may imagine. If the reader has pictured
to himself large masses of entire corals, piled one upon another, for a
thickness of several thousand feet, he unquestionably mistakes altogether
the nature of the accumulations now in progress. In the first place, the
strata at present forming very extensively over the bottom of the ocean,
within such barrier reefs as those of Australia and New Caledonia, are
known to consist chiefly of horizontal layers of calcareous sediment,
while here and there an intermixture must occur of the detritus of granitic
and other rocks brought down by rivers from the adjoining lands,
or washed from sea-cliffs by the waves and currents. Secondly, in regard
to atolls, the stone-making polypifers grow most luxuriantly on the
outer edge of the island, to a thickness of a few feet only. Beyond this
margin broken pieces of coral and calcareous sand are strewed by the
breakers over a steep seaward slope, and as the subsidence continues the
next coating of live coral does not grow vertically over the first layer,
but on a narrow annular space within it, the reef, as was before stated
(p. 761), constantly contracting its dimensions as it sinks. Thirdly,
within the lagoon the accumulation of calcareous matter is chiefly sedimentary,
a kind of chalky mud derived from the decay of the softer
corallines, with a mixture of calcareous sand swept by the winds and
waves from the surrounding circular reef. Here and there, but only in
partial clumps, are found living corals, which grow in the middle of the
lagoon, and mixed with fine mud and sand, a great variety of shells, and
fragments of testacea and echinoderms.</p>

<p>We owe to Lieutenant Nelson the discovery that in the Bermudas the
calcareous mud resulting from the decomposition of the softer corallines
is absolutely undistinguishable when dried from the ordinary white chalk
of Europe,<a name="FNanchor_1133" id="FNanchor_1133"></a><a href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor">1133</a> and this mud is carried to great distances by currents, and
spread far and wide over the floor of the ocean. We also have opportunities
of seeing in upraised atolls, such as Elizabeth Island, Tonga, and
Hapai, which rise above the level of the sea to heights varying from ten
to eighty feet, that the rocks of which they consist do not differ in
structure or in the state of preservation of their included zoophytes and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_794" id="Page_794">794</a></span>
shells from some of the oldest limestones known to the geologist. Captain
Beechey remarks that the dead coral in Elizabeth Island is more or
less porous and honeycombed at the surface, and hardening into a compact
rock which has the fracture of <i>secondary limestone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_1134" id="FNanchor_1134"></a><a href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor">1134</a></p>

<p>The island of Pulo Nias, off Sumatra (see Map, <a href="#f39">fig. 39</a>. p. 351), which
is about 3000 feet high, is described by Dr. Jack as being overspread by
coral and large shells of the <i>Chama (Tridacna) gigas</i>, which rest on
quartzose and arenaceous rocks, at various levels from the sea-coast to
the summit of the highest hills.</p>

<p>The cliffs of the island of Timor in the Indian Ocean are composed,
says Mr. Jukes, of a raised coral reef abounding in <i>Astr&aelig;a</i>, <i>Meandrina</i>,
and <i>Porites</i>, with shells of <i>Strombus</i>, <i>Conus</i>, <i>Nerita</i>, <i>Arca</i>, <i>Pecten</i>,
<i>Venus</i>, and <i>Lucina</i>. On a ledge about 150 feet above the sea, a Tridacna
(or large clam shell), two feet across, was found bedded in the
rock with closed valves, just as they are often seen in barrier reefs. This
formation in the islands of Sandlewood, Sumbawa, Madura, and Java,
where it is exposed in sea cliffs, was found to be from 200 to 300 feet
thick, and is believed to ascend to much greater heights in the interior.
It has usually the form of a "chalk-like" rock, white when broken, but
in the weathered surface turning nearly black.<a name="FNanchor_1135" id="FNanchor_1135"></a><a href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor">1135</a></p>

<p>It appears, therefore, premature to assert that there are no recent coral
formations uplifted to great heights, for we are only beginning to be
acquainted with the geological structure of the rocks of equatorial
regions. Some of the upraised islands, such as Elizabeth and Queen
Charlotte, in the Pacific, although placed in regions of atolls, are
described by Captain Beechey and others as flat-topped, and exhibiting
no traces of lagoons. In explanation of the fact, we may presume that
after they had been sinking for ages, the descending movement was
relaxed; and while it was in the course of being converted into an
ascending one, the ground remained for a long season almost stationary,
in which case the corals within the lagoon would build up to the surface,
and reach the level already attained by those on the margin of the reef.
In this manner the lagoon would be effaced, and the island acquire a
flat summit.</p>

<p>It may, however, be thought strange that many examples have not
been noticed of fringing reefs uplifted above the level of the sea. Mr.
Darwin, indeed, cites one instance where the reef preserved, on dry land
in the Mauritius, its peculiar moat-like structure; but they ought, he says,
to be of rare occurrence, for in the case of atolls or of barrier or fringing
reefs, the characteristic outline must usually be destroyed by denudation
as soon as a reef begins to rise; since it is immediately exposed to the
action of the breakers, and the large and conspicuous corals on the outer
rim of the atoll or barrier are the first to be destroyed and to fall to the
bottom of vertical and undermined cliffs. After slow and continued
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_795" id="Page_795">795</a></span>
upheaval a wreck alone can remain of the original reef. If, therefore,
says Mr. Darwin, "at some period as far in futurity as the secondary
rocks are in the past, the bed of the Pacific with its atolls and barrier
reefs should be converted into a continent, we may conceive that scarcely
any or none of the existing reefs would be preserved, but only widely
spread strata of calcareous matter derived from their wear and tear."<a name="FNanchor_1136" id="FNanchor_1136"></a><a href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor">1136</a></p>

<p>When it is urged in support of the objection before stated (p. 767),
that the theory of atolls by subsidence implies the accumulation of calcareous
formations 2000 or 3000 feet thick, it must be conceded that
this estimate of the minimum density of the deposits is by no means
exaggerated. On the contrary, when we consider that the space over
which atolls are scattered in Polynesia and the Indian oceans may be
compared to the whole continent of Asia, we cannot but infer from
analogy that the differences in level in so vast an area have amounted,
antecedently to subsidence, to 5000 or even a greater number of feet.
Whatever was the difference in height between the loftiest and lowest
of the original mountains or mountainous islands on which the different
atolls are based, that difference must represent the thickness of coral
which has now reduced all of them to one level. Flinders, therefore, by
no means exaggerated the volume of the limestone, which he conceived
to have been the work of coral animals; he was merely mistaken as to
the manner in which they were enabled to build reefs in an unfathomed
ocean.</p>

<p>But is it reasonable to expect, after the waste caused by denudation,
that calcareous masses, gradually upheaved in an open sea, should retain
such vast thicknesses? Or may not the limestones of the cretaceous and
oolitic epochs, which attain in the Alps and Pyrenees a density of 3000
or 4000 feet, and are in great part made up of coralline and shelly matter,
present us with a true geological counterpart of the recent coral reefs of
equatorial seas?</p>

<p>Before we attach serious importance to arguments founded on negative
evidence, and opposed to a theory which so admirably explains a great
variety of complicated phenomena, we ought to remember that the upheaval
to the height of 4000 feet of atolls in which the coralline limestone
would be 4000 feet thick, implies, first, a slow subsidence of 4000
feet, and, secondly, an elevation of the same amount. Even if the reverse
or ascending movement began the instant the downward one ceased, we
must allow a great lapse of ages for the accomplishment of the whole
operation. We must also assume that at the commencement of the
period in question, the equatorial regions were as fitted as now for the
support of reef-building zoophytes. This postulate would demand the
continuance of a complicated variety of conditions throughout a much
longer period than they are usually persistent in one place.</p>

<p>To show the difficulty of speculating on the permanence of the geographical
and climatal circumstances requisite for the growth of reef-building
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_796" id="Page_796">796</a></span>
corals, we have only to state the fact that there are no reefs in
the Atlantic, off the west coast of Africa, nor among the islands of the
Gulf of Guinea, nor in St. Helena, Ascension, the Cape Verdes, or St.
Paul's. With the exception of Bermuda, there is not a single coral reef
in the central expanse of the Atlantic, although in some parts the waves,
as at Ascension, are charged to excess with calcareous matter. This capricious
distribution of coral reefs is probably owing to the absence of fit
stations for the reef-building polypifers, other organic beings in those regions
obtaining in the great struggle for existence a mastery over them.
Their absence, in whatever manner it be accounted for, should put us on
our guard against expecting upraised reefs at all former geological epochs,
similar to those now in progress.</p>

<p><i>Lime, whence derived.</i>&mdash;Dr. Maculloch, in his system of Geology, vol.
i. p. 219, expressed himself in favor of the theory of some of the earlier
geologists, that all limestones have originated in organized substances.
If we examine, he says, the quantity of limestone in the primary strata,
it will be found to bear a much smaller proportion to the siliceous and
argillaceous rocks than in the secondary; and this may have some connexion
with the rarity of testaceous animals in the ancient ocean. He
farther infers, that in consequence of the operations of animals, "the
quantity of calcareous earth deposited in the form of mud or stone is
always increasing; and that as the secondary series far exceeds the primary
in this respect, so a third series may hereafter arise from the depths of
the sea, which may exceed the last in the proportion of its calcareous strata."</p>

<p>If these propositions went no farther than to suggest that every particle
of lime that now enters into the crust of the globe, may possibly in
its turn have been subservient to the purposes of life, by entering into
the composition of organized bodies, I should not deem the speculation
improbable; but, when it is hinted that lime may be an animal product
combined by the powers of vitality from some simple elements, I can discover
no sufficient grounds for such an hypothesis, and many facts militate
against it.</p>

<p>If a large pond be made in almost any soil, and filled with rain water,
it may usually become tenanted by testacea; for carbonate of lime is
almost universally diffused in small quantities. But if no calcareous matter
be supplied by waters flowing from the surrounding high grounds, or
by springs, no tufa or shell-marl are formed. The thin shells of one
generation of mollusks decompose, so that their elements afford nutriment
to the succeeding races; and it is only where a stream enters a lake,
which may introduce a fresh supply of calcareous matter, or where the
lake is fed by springs, that shells accumulate and form marl.</p>

<p>All the lakes in Forfarshire which have produced deposits of shell-marl
have been the sites of springs, which still evolve much carbonic acid, and
a small quantity of carbonate of lime. But there is no marl in Loch
Fithie, near Forfar, where there are <i>no springs</i>, although that lake is surrounded
by these calcareous deposits, and although, in every other respect,
the site is favorable to the accumulation of aquatic testacea.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_797" id="Page_797">797</a></span>
We find those Char&aelig; which secrete the largest quantity of calcareous
matter in their stems to abound near springs impregnated with carbonate
of lime. We know that, if the common hen be deprived altogether of
calcareous nutriment, the shells of her eggs will become of too slight a
consistency to protect the contents; and some birds eat chalk greedily
during the breeding season.</p>

<p>If, on the other hand, we turn to the phenomena of inorganic nature,
we observe that, in volcanic countries, there is an enormous evolution of
carbonic acid, either free, in a gaseous form, or mixed with water; and
the springs of such districts are usually impregnated with carbonate of
lime in great abundance. No one who has travelled in Tuscany, through
the region of extinct volcanos and its confines, or who has seen the map
constructed by Targioni (1827), to show the principal sites of mineral
springs, can doubt, for a moment, that if this territory was submerged
beneath the sea, it might supply materials for the most extensive coral
reefs. The importance of these springs is not to be estimated by the
magnitude of the rocks which they have thrown down on the slanting
sides of hills, although of these alone large cities might be built, nor by
a coating of travertin that covers the soil in some districts for miles in
length. The greater part of the calcareous matter passes down in a state
of solution to the sea, and in all countries the rivers which flow from
chalk and other marly and calcareous rocks carry down vast quantities of
lime into the ocean. Lime is also one of the component parts of augite
and other volcanic and hypogene minerals, and when these decompose is
set free, and may then find its way in a state of solution to the sea.</p>

<p>The lime, therefore, contained generally in sea water, and secreted so
plentifully by the testacea and corals of the Pacific, may have been
derived either from springs rising up in the bed of the ocean, or from rivers
fed by calcareous springs, or impregnated with lime derived from disintegrated
rocks, both volcanic and hypogene. If this be admitted, the
greater proportion of limestone in the more modern formations as compared
to the most ancient, will be explained, for springs in general hold
no argillaceous, and but a small quantity of siliceous matter in solution,
but they are continually subtracting calcareous matter from the inferior
rocks. The constant transfer, therefore, of carbonate of lime from the
lower or older portions of the earth's crust to the surface, must cause at
all periods and throughout an indefinite succession of geological epochs,
a preponderance of calcareous matter in the newer as contrasted with the
older formations.</p>

<h6>CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h6>

<p>In the concluding chapters of the first book, I examined in detail a
great variety of arguments which have been adduced to prove the distinctness
of the state of the earth's crust at remote and recent epochs.
Among other supposed proofs of this distinctness, the dearth of calcareous
matter, in the ancient rocks above adverted to, might have been
considered. But it would have been endless to enumerate all the objections
urged against those geologists who represent the course of nature
at the earliest periods as resembling in all essential circumstances the
state of things now established. We have seen that, in opposition to
this doctrine, a strong desire has been manifested to discover in the ancient
rocks the signs of an epoch when the planet was uninhabited, and
when its surface was in a chaotic condition and uninhabitable. The
opposite opinion, indeed, that the oldest of the rocks now visible may
be the last monuments of an antecedent era in which living beings may
already have peopled the land and water, has been declared to be
equivalent to the assumption that there never was a beginning to the
present order of things.</p>

<p>With equal justice might an astronomer be accused of asserting that
the works of creation extended throughout <i>infinite</i> space, because he
refuses to take for granted that the remotest stars now seen in the
heavens are on the utmost verge of the material universe. Every improvement
of the telescope has brought thousands of new worlds into
view; and it would, therefore, be rash and unphilosophical to imagine
that we already survey the whole extent of the vast scheme, or that it
will ever be brought within the sphere of human observation.</p>

<p>But no argument can be drawn from such premises in favor of the
infinity of the space that has been filled with worlds; and if the material
universe has any limits, it then follows, that it must occupy a minute
and infinitesimal point in infinite space.</p>

<p>So if, in tracing back the earth's history, we arrive at the monuments
of events which may have happened millions of ages before our times,
and if we still find no decided evidence of a commencement, yet the
arguments from analogy in support of the probability of a beginning
remain unshaken; and if the past duration of the earth be finite, then
the aggregate of geological epochs, however numerous, must constitute
a mere moment of the past, a mere infinitesimal portion of eternity.</p>

<p>It has been argued, that, as the different states of the earth's surface,
and the different species by which it has been inhabited have all had
their origin, and many of them their termination, so the entire series may
have commenced at a certain period. It has also been urged, that,
as we admit the creation of man to have occurred at a comparatively
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_799" id="Page_799">799</a></span>
modern epoch&mdash;as we concede the astonishing fact of the first introduction
of a moral and intellectual being&mdash;so also we may conceive the first
creation of the planet itself.</p>

<p>I am far from denying the weight of this reasoning from analogy;
but, although it may strengthen our conviction, that the present system
of change has not gone on from eternity, it cannot warrant us in presuming
that we shall be permitted to behold the signs of the earth's
origin, or the evidences of the first introduction into it of organic beings.
We aspire in vain to assign limits to the works of creation in <i>space</i>,
whether we examine the starry heavens, or that world of minute animalcules
which is revealed to us by the microscope. We are prepared,
therefore, to find that in time also the confines of the universe lie beyond
the reach of mortal ken. But in whatever direction we pursue
our researches, whether in <i>time</i> or space, we discover everywhere the
clear proofs of a Creative Intelligence, and of His foresight, wisdom,
and power.</p>

<p>As geologists, we learn that it is not only the present condition of
the globe which has been suited to the accommodation of myriads of
living creatures, but that many former states also have been adapted to
the organization and habits of prior races of beings. The disposition
of the seas, continents, and islands, and the climates, have varied; the
species likewise have been changed; and yet they have all been so
modelled, on types analogous to those of existing plants and animals, as
to indicate, throughout, a perfect harmony of design and unity of purpose.
To assume that the evidence of the beginning or end of so vast a
scheme lies within the reach of our philosophical inquiries, or even of
our speculations, appears to be inconsistent with a just estimate of the
relations which subsist between the finite powers of man and the attributes
of an Infinite and Eternal Being.</p>

chandeliers. Quartz being often met with in rocks in such
forms, and beautifully transparent like ice, was called
<i>rock-crystal</i>, &#954;&#961;&#965;&#963;&#964;&#945;&#955;&#955;&#959;&#962;, crystallos, being Greek
for ice. Hence the regular <i>forms</i> of other minerals are
called crystals, whether they be clear or opake.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Cycade&aelig;.</span> A small and very anomalous order of flowering
plants, chiefly found in Mexico, the East Indian Islands,
South Africa, and Australia. They are Gymnogens as to
ovules, and neither Exogens nor Endogens in the wood of
their short, simple, or branched trunks, and they have
dicotyledonous seeds. The leaves are pinnated (like those of
cocoa-nut palms), and when young are rolled inwards as in
Ferns. The wood fibres are curiously perforated, and marked,
by which they are recognized in a fossil state as well as by
the trunk and foliage, and the cones, which contain the male
flowers. The term is derived from &#954;&#965;&#954;&#945;&#962;, <i>cycas</i>, a
name applied by the ancient Greek naturalist Threophrastus
to a palm.</p>

<p class="indentsp"><span class="smcap">Cyperace&aelig;.</span> A tribe of plants answering to the English
sedges; they are distinguished from grasses by their stems

constitute what writers on botanical geography often call
<i>glumace&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Debacle.</span> A great rush of waters, which, breaking down all

resemblance to the letter of the Greek
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_804" id="Page_804">804</a></span>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Dikes.</span> When a mass of the unstratified or igneous rocks,
such as granite, trap, and lava, appears as if injected into
a rent in the stratified rocks, cutting across the strata,
it forms a dike. They are sometimes seen running along the
ground, and projecting, like a wall, from the softer strata
on both sides of them having wasted away; whence they were
first called in the north of England and in Scotland
<i>dikes</i>, a provincial name for wall. It is not easy to draw
the line between dikes and veins. The former are generally
of larger dimensions, and have their sides parallel for
considerable distances; while veins have generally many
ramifications, and these often thin away into slender
threads.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Diluvium.</span> Those accumulations of gravel and loose materials,
which, by some geologists, are said to have been produced by

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Experimentum Crucis.</span> A decisive experiment, so called,
because, like a cross or direction-post, it directs men to
true knowledge; or, as some explain it, because it is a kind
of torture whereby the nature of the thing is extorted, as
it were, by violence.</p>

<p class="indentsp"><span class="smcap">Exuvi&aelig;.</span> Properly speaking, the transient parts of
certain animals which they put off or lay down to assume new
ones, as serpents and caterpillars shift their skins; but in
geology it refers not only to the cast-off coverings of
animals, but to fossil shells and other remains which
animals have left in the strata of the earth. <i>Etym.</i>,

by a crack or fissure, varying in width from a mere line to
several feet, which is generally filled with broken stone,
clay, &amp;c.
The strata, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, &amp;c., must at one time have
been continuous; but a fracture having taken place at the
fault F, either by the upheaving of the portion A, or the
sinking of the portion B, the strata were so displaced that
the bed <i>a</i> in B is many feet lower than the same bed <i>a</i> in
the portion A.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Fauna.</span> The various kinds of animals peculiar to a country
constitute its <span class="smcap">Fauna</span>, as the various kinds of plants

rural deities, in Roman Mythology.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Felspar.</span> A simple mineral, which, next to quartz,
constitutes the chief material of rocks. The white angular
portions in granite are felspar. This mineral always
contains some alkali in its composition. In <i>common felspar</i>
the alkali is potash; in another variety, called Albite or
Cleavlandite, it is soda. Glassy felspar is a term applied

structure. The hypogene or primary <i>schists</i>, as they are
termed, such as gneiss, mica-schist, and others, cannot be

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Strata, Stratum.</span> The term stratum, derived from the Latin
verb <i>struo</i>, to strew or lay out, means a bed or mass of
matter spread out over a certain surface by the action of
water, or in some cases by wind. The deposition of
successive layers of sand and gravel in the bed of a river,
or in a canal, affords a perfect illustration both of the
form and origin of stratification. A large portion of the
masses constituting the earth's crust are thus stratified,
the successive strata of a given rock preserving a general
parallelism to each other; but the planes of stratification
not being perfectly parallel throughout a great extent like
the planes of <i>cleavage</i>, which see.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_815" id="Page_815">815</a></span>
talus. The term is borrowed from the language of
fortification, where <i>talus</i> means the outside of a wall of
which the thickness is diminished by degrees, as it rises in
height, to make it the firmer.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Tarsi.</span> The feet in insects, which are articulated, and

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Thin Out.</span> When a stratum, in the course of its prolongation
in any direction, becomes gradually less in thickness, the
two surfaces approach nearer and nearer; and when at last
they meet, the stratum is said to thin out or disappear.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Trachyte.</span> A variety of lava essentially composed of glassy
felspar, and frequently having detached crystals of felspar
in the base or body of the stone, giving it the structure of
porphyry. It sometimes contains hornblende and augite; and
when these last predominate, the trachyte passes into the
varieties of trap, called Greenstone, Basalt, Dolorite,
&amp;c. The term is derived from &#964;&#961;&#945;&#967;&#965;&#962;,
<i>trachus</i>, rough, because the rock has a peculiar rough
feel.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Trap</span> and <span class="smcap">Trappean Rocks</span>. Volcanic rocks composed of felspar,
augite, and hornblende. The various proportions and state of
aggregation of these simple minerals, and differences in
external forms, give rise to varieties, which have received
distinct appellations, such as Basalt, Amygdaloid, Dolorite,
Greenstone, and others. The term is derived from <i>trappa</i>, a
Swedish word for stair, because the rocks of this class
sometimes occur in large tabular masses, rising one above
another like steps.</p>

formed in great quantity by the river Anio, at Tibur, near
Rome. Some suppose travertin to be an abbreviation of
trasterverino from transtiburtinus.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Tripoli.</span> The name of a powder used for polishing metals and
stones, first imported from Tripoli, which, as well as a

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_816" id="Page_816">816</a></span>
and they ramify or branch off into innumerable smaller
parts, often as slender as threads, like the veins in an
animal, hence their name.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="smcap">Vertebrated Animals.</span> A great division of the animal kingdom,
including all those which are furnished with a back-bone, as
the mammalia, birds, reptiles, and fishes. The separate
joints of the back-bone are called <i>vertebr&aelig;</i>, from

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">18</span></a> Raspe, in a learned and judicious essay (De Novis Insulis, cap. 19), has made
it appear extremely probable that all the traditions of certain islands in the Mediterranean
having at some former time frequently shifted their positions, and at
length become stationary, originated in the great change produced in their form
by earthquakes and submarine eruptions, of which there have been modern examples
in the new islands raised in the time of history. When the series of convulsions
ended, the island was said to become fixed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">19</span></a> It is not inconsistent with the Hindoo mythology to suppose that Pythagoras
might have found in the East not only the system of universal and violent catastrophes
and periods of repose in endless succession, but also that of periodical
revolutions, effected by the continued agency of ordinary causes. For Brahma,
Vishnu, and Siva, the first, second, and third persons of the Hindoo triad, severally
represented the Creative, the Preserving, and the Destroying powers of the Deity.
The coexistence of these three attributes, all in simultaneous operation,
might well accord with the notion of perpetual but partial alterations finally bringing
about a complete change. But the fiction expressed in the verses before quoted
from Men&ugrave; of eternal vicissitudes in the vigils and slumbers of Brahma seems accommodated
to the system of great general catastrophes followed by new creations
and periods of repose.</p></div>

after quinque; but, at the suggestion of M. de Schlegel, I have referred the number
twenty-five to the period of years, and not to the number of pairs of each

often very sanguinary. In the same ages wherein learning was most in esteem,
the Mahometans were divided into two sects, one of whom maintained that the
Koran was increate, and had subsisted in the very essence of God from all eternity;
and the other, the Motazalites, who, admitting that the Koran was instituted
by God, conceived it to have been first made when revealed to the Prophet
at Mecca, and accused their opponents of believing in two eternal beings. The
opinions of each of these sects were taken up by different caliphs in succession, and
the followers of each sometimes submitted to be beheaded, or flogged till at the
point of death, rather than renounce their creed.&mdash;Mod. Univ. Hist. vol. ii. ch. iv.</p></div>

before, in a short article entitled "On the Bottom of the Sea." From observations
collected from the divers of the pearl fishery, Boyle inferred that, when the waves
were six or seven feet high above the surface of the water, there were no signs of
agitation at the depth of fifteen fathoms; and that even during heavy gales of
wind, the motion of the water was exceedingly diminished at the depth of twelve
or fifteen feet. He had also learnt from some of his informants, that there were
currents running in opposite directions at different depths.&mdash;Boyle's Works, vol.

clearness the different modes wherein organic substances may become lapidified;
and, among other illustrations, he mentions some silicified palm-wood brought
from Africa, on which M. de la Hire had read a memoir to the Royal Academy
of France (June, 1692), wherein he had pointed out, not only the tubes running
the length of the trunk, but the roots at one extremity. De la Hire, says Hooke,
also treated of certain trees found petrified in the "river that passes by Bakan,
in the kingdom of <i>Ava</i>, and which has for the space of ten leagues the virtue of
petrifying wood." It is an interesting fact that the silicified wood of the Irawadi
should have attracted attention more than one hundred years ago. Remarkable
discoveries have been made there in later times of fossil animals and vegetables,
by Mr. Crawfurd and Dr. Wallich.&mdash;See Geol. Trans. vol. ii. part iii. p. 377, second

Michell's observations anticipate in so remarkable a manner the theories established
forty years afterwards, that his writings would probably have formed an era in
the science, if his researches had been uninterrupted. He held, however, his professorship
only eight years, when his career was suddenly cut short by preferment
to a benefice. From that time he appears to have been engaged in his clerical
duties, and to have entirely discontinued his scientific pursuits, exemplifying the
working of a system still in force at Oxford and Cambridge, where the chairs of
mathematics, natural philosophy, chemistry, botany, astronomy, geology, mineralogy,
and others, being frequently filled by clergymen, the reward of success disqualifies
them, if they conscientiously discharge their new duties, from farther
advancing the cause of science, and that, too, at the moment when their labors
would naturally bear the richest fruits.</p></div>

that dealers in shells had long been in the habit of selling Mediterranean species
as shells of more southern and distant latitudes, for the sake of enhancing their
price. It appears, moreover, from several hundred experiments made by that
distinguished hydrographer, Capt. Smith, on the water within eight fathoms of
the surface, that the temperature of the Mediterranean is on an average 3&frac12;&deg; of
Fahrenheit higher than the western part of the Atlantic ocean; an important fact,
which in some degree may help to explain why many species are common to
tropical latitudes and to the Mediterranean.</p></div>

in the "Library of Useful Knowledge," it is stated that both Galileo's work, and
the book of Copernicus, "Nisi corrigatur" (for, with the omission of certain passages,
it was sanctioned), were still to be seen on the forbidden list of the Index
at Rome, in 1828. I was, however, assured in the same year, by Professor Scarpellini,
at Rome, that Pius VII., a pontiff distinguished for his love of science, had
procured a repeal of the edicts against Galileo and the Copernican system. He
had assembled the Congregation; and the late Cardinal Toriozzi, assessor of the
Sacred Office, proposed that they should wipe off this scandal from the church."
The repeal was carried, with the dissentient voice of one Dominican only. Long
before that time the Newtonian theory had been taught in the Sapienza, and all
Catholic universities in Europe (with the exception, I am told, of Salamanca); but
it was always required of professors, in deference to the decrees of the church, to
use the term <i>hypothesis</i>, instead of theory. They now speak of the Copernican
<i>theory</i>.</p></div>

and its former fitness as a residence for the mammoth, were first given in their
present form in my 4th edition, June, 1835. Recently Sir R. Murchison and his
companions in their great work on the Geology of Russia, 1845 (vol. i. p. 497), have,
in citing this chapter, declared that their investigations have led them to similar
conclusions. Professor Owen, in his excellent History of British Fossil Mammalia,
1844, p. 261, <i>et seq.</i>, observes that the teeth of the mammoth differ from those of
the living Asiatic or African elephant in having a larger proportion of dense enamel,
which may have enabled it to subsist on the coarser ligneous tissues of trees and
shrubs. In short, he is of opinion, that the structure of its teeth, as well as the
nature of its epidermis and coverings, may have made it "a meet companion for
the reindeer."</p></div>

Bishop Heber informs us (Narr. of a Journey through the Upper Provinces of
India, vol. ii. p. 166-219), that in the lower range of the Himalaya mountains,
in the northeastern borders of the Delhi territory, between lat. 29&deg; and 30&deg;, he saw
an Indian elephant of a small size, covered with shaggy hair. But this variety must
be exceedingly rare; for Mr. Royle (late superintendent of the East India Company's
Botanic Garden at Saharunpore) has assured me, that being in India when
Heber's Journal appeared, and having never seen or heard of such elephants, he
made the strictest inquiries respecting the fact, and was never able to obtain any
evidence in corroboration. Mr. Royle resided at Saharunpore, lat. 30&deg; N., upon
<i>the extreme northern limits</i> of the range of the elephant. Mr. Everest also declares
that he has been equally unsuccessful in finding any one aware of the existence
of such a variety or breed of the animal, though one solitary individual was
mentioned to him as having been seen at Delhi, with a good deal of long hair upon
it. The greatest elevation, says Mr. E., at which the wild elephant is found
in the mountains to the north of Bengal, is at a place called Nahun, about 4000
feet above the level of the sea, and in the 31st degree of N. lat., where the mean
yearly temperature may be about 64&deg; Fahrenheit, and the difference between
winter and summer very great, equal to about 36&deg; F., the month of January
averaging 45&deg;, and June, the hottest month, 81&deg; F. (Everest on climate of Foss.

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_156" id="Footnote_156"></a><a href="#FNanchor_156"><span class="label">156</span></a> The Calamites were formerly regarded by Adolphe Brongniart as belonging
to the tribe of Equisetace&aelig;; but he is now inclined to refer them to the class of
gymnogens, or gymnospermous exogens, which includes the Conifer&aelig; and Cycade&aelig;.
Lepidodendron appears to have been either a gigantic form of the lycopodium
tribe, or, as Dr. Lindley thinks, intermediate between the lycopodia and the
fir tribe. The Sigillari&aelig; were formerly supposed by Ad. Brongniart, to be arborescent
ferns; but the discovery of their internal structure, and of their leaves, has
since proved that they have no real affinity to ferns. According to the view now
taken of their structure, their nearest allies in the recent world are the genera
Cycas and Zamia; while Corda, on the other hand, maintains that they were
closely related to the succulent euphorbias. Stigmaria is now generally admitted
to have been merely the root of sigillaria. The scalariform vessels of these two
genera are not conclusive in proving them to have a real affinity with ferns, as
Mr. Brown has discovered the same structure of vessels in Myzodendron, a genus
allied to the mistletoe; and Corda has lately shown that in two species of Stigmaria,
hardly distinguishable by external characters, the vessels of the one are
scalariform, and of the other dotted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_157" id="Footnote_157"></a><a href="#FNanchor_157"><span class="label">157</span></a> Mr. Lindley endeavored formerly (1834) to show, in the "Fossil Flora," that
Trigonocarpum Noeggerathii, a fruit found in the coal measures, has the true
structure of a palm-fruit; but Ad. Brongniart has since inclined to regard it as
cycadeous; nor is the French botanist satisfied that some specimens of supposed
palm wood from the coal-mines of Radnitz in Bohemia, described by Corda, really
belong to palms. On the other hand, Corda has proved Flabellaria borassifolia of
Sternberg to be an exogenous plant, and Brongniart contends that it was allied to
the Cycade&aelig;. See Tableau des Genres de V&eacute;g&eacute;taux Fossiles. Paris, 1849.</p></div>

by Sir John F. W. Herschel in his Discourse on Natural Philosophy, published in

to estimate the probable depth of the sea from some of the phenomena of
the tides, says of the ocean generally, "que sa profondeur moyenne est du m&ecirc;me
ordre que la hauteur moyenne des continens et des isles au-dessus de son niveau,
hauteur qui ne surpasse pas mille m&egrave;tres (3280 ft.)" Mec. C&eacute;leste, tom. xi. et
Syst. du Monde, p. 254. The expression "du m&ecirc;me ordre" admits in mathematical
language of considerable latitude of signification, and does not mean that the
depth of the water below the level of the sea corresponds exactly to the height
of the land above it.
</p><p>
It appeared from the observations of Sir James Ross, communicated to me in
1849, by himself, and his fellow voyager, Dr. Joseph Hooker, that in latitude 15&deg;
3' S., longitude 23&deg; 14' W. (the island of Trinidad, the nearest land, being 486
miles distant, and bearing S. 47 W.), they sounded with a weight of 76 lbs., and
4600 fathoms of line, which ran out to the very end, without finding bottom.
Here therefore in mid-ocean the depth exceeded 27,600 feet. One of the shallowest
soundings ever obtained in the open sea during the same survey, struck bottom
with 2677 fathoms, or 16,062 feet, latitude 33&deg; 21' S., longitude 9&deg; 4' E. The
surveyors arrived at the conclusion, that at a moderate distance from the shore,
the depth of the great ocean always exceeds 4000 feet.
</p><p>
During the American survey in 1849, a much greater depth, or 5700 fathoms
(34,200 feet), was sounded in the Atlantic by Lieut. Walsh, without reaching the
bottom, in lat. 31&deg; 59' N., long. 58&deg; 43' W., or between the Bermudas and the
Azores. But the deepest soundings yet published were taken Oct. 30th 1852, by
Capt. Henry M. Denham, R. N., who reached bottom at 7706 fathoms (46,236 feet),
lat. 36&deg; 49' S., long. 37&deg; 6' W., the nearest land being at the mouth of the River
Plate. A weight of 9 lbs. was attached to the line, which was one-tenth of an inch in
diameter; the day was calm, and the line took 9 hours 24 minutes to run out.
When the bottom was struck the line was raised 50 fathoms, and then allowed
to run out again. It struck at the same point as before, verifying the observations.
Nevertheless some experienced surveyors have remarked that the experiment
would have been more satisfactory had the weight been greater. The highest
summits of the Himalaya are about 28,000 feet; the Pacific, according to this
sounding, is probably at some points twice as deep as the Himalaya are high.</p></div>

by supposing the eye of the observer to be placed above that city, and to see from
thence one half of the globe. For it so happens that from that point, and no other,
we should behold the greatest possible quantity of land; and if we are then transferred
to the opposite or antipodal point, we should see the greatest possible quantity
of water. (See figs. <a href="#f3">3</a> and <a href="#f4">4</a>.) A singular fact, first pointed out by Mr. James
Gardner, namely, that only one twenty-seventh part of the dry land has any land
opposite to it, is intimately connected with this excess of land in one of the two
hemispheres above alluded to. Thus, in <a href="#f3">fig. 3</a>, the land shaded black in part of
China answers to that portion of the extremity of South America and Tierra del

if included, it would probably add to the excess of dry land; for the late

conjecture of Captain Cook that the accumulation of antarctic ice implies the presence
of a certain quantity of terra firma. The number of square miles on the surface
of the globe are 148,522,000, the part occupied by the sea being 110,849,000,
and that by land, 37,673,000; so that the land is very nearly to the sea as 1 part
in 4. I am informed by Mr. Gardner that, according to a rough approximation, the
land between the 30&deg; N. lat. and the pole occupies a space <i>about equal to that of
the sea</i>, and the land between the 30&deg; S. lat. and the antarctic circle about one-sixteenth

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_237" id="Footnote_237"></a><a href="#FNanchor_237"><span class="label">237</span></a> It has been suspected ever since the middle of the last century, that the
Caspian was lower than the ocean, it being known that in Astrakhan the mercury
in the barometer generally stands above thirty inches. In 1811, MM. Engelhardt
and Parrot attempted to determine the exact amount of difference by a series of
levellings and barometrical measurements across the isthmus at two different
places near the foot of Mount Caucasus. The result of their operations led them
to the opinion that the Caspian was more than 300 feet below the Black Sea.
But the correctness of the observations having afterwards been called in question,
M. Parrot revisited the ground in 1829 and 1830, and inferred from new levellings,
that the mouth of the Don was between three and four feet lower than
that of the Wolga; in other words, that the sea of Azof, which communicates
with the Black Sea, was actually lower than the Caspian! Other statements,
no less contradictory, having been made by other observers, the Russian government
at length directed the Academy of St. Petersburg to send an expedition,
in 1836, to decide the point by a trigonometrical survey, from which it appeared
that the Caspian is 101 Russian, or 108 English, feet lower than the Black Sea.

however, concludes, in 1845, from the best Russian authorities, that the depression
of the Caspian is only 83 feet 6 inches.
</p><p>
The measurements of Major Anthony Symonds, since confirmed by French
authorities, make the Dead Sea to be 1200 feet below the Mediterranean.</p></div>

Syst&egrave;mes des Montagnes) has come to the conclusion, that the principal mountain
ranges, if prolonged, would intersect each other at certain angles, so as to produce
a regular geometric arrangement, which he calls "a pentagonal network." This
theory has been ably discussed and controverted by Mr. Hopkins, in his Anniversary
Address as President of the Geol. Soc., Feb. 1853.</p></div>

The conchological evidence respecting the British Miocene, Pliocene, and Pleistocene
fossils, examined by Mr. Forbes, in the paper before cited, p. 88, note, bear
out some of the most important conclusions of M. Deshayes, quoted by me in the
first edition of the Principles, 1831, and the recent observations of Philippi in regard
to the passage of species from one formation to another. I refer to these
authorities more especially because this doctrine of a gradual transition has been
opposed by some living naturalists of high distinction, among whom I may mention
M.A. d'Orbigny and M. Agassiz. I have long been convinced that we must
abandon many of the identifications formerly made of Eocene with recent shells;
but some errors of this kind do not affect the general reasoning on the subject.

partition formed of stout planks, which is calked, and made so effectually
water-tight that the foremost end of the vessel is cut off as entirely from the rest
of the hold as if it belonged to another boat. If the steam-vessel happen to run
against a snag, and that a hole is made in her bow, under the surface, this chamber
merely fills with water."&mdash;Travels in North America, vol. iii. p. 363.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_364" id="Footnote_364"></a><a href="#FNanchor_364"><span class="label">364</span></a> Trees submerged in an upright position have been observed in other parts of
N. America. Thus Captains Clark and Lewis found, about the year 1807, a forest
of pines standing erect under water in the body of the Columbia river, which they
supposed, from the appearance of the trees, to have been submerged only about
twenty years. (Travels, &amp;c. vol. ii. p. 241.) More lately (1835), the Rev. Mr.
Parker observed on the same river (lat. 45&deg; N., long. 121&deg; W.) trees standing in
their natural position in spots where the water was more than twenty feet deep.
The tops of the trees had disappeared; but between high and low water-mark
the trunks were only partially decayed; and the roots were seen through the
clear water, spreading as they had grown in their native forest. (Tour beyond
the Rocky Mountains, p. 132.) Some have inferred from these facts that a tract
of land, more than twenty miles in length, must have subsided vertically; but
Capt. Fremont, Dec. 1845 (Rep. of Explor. Exped. p. 195), satisfied himself that
the submerged forests have been formed by immense land-slides from the mountains,
which here closely shut in the river.</p></div>

in a lecture which I delivered at Southampton in September, 1846. (See Athen&aelig;um
Journal, Sept. 26, 1846, and Report of British Association, 1846, p. 117.)
Dr. Riddell has since repeated his experiments on the quantity of sediment in
the river at New Orleans without any material variation in the results.
</p><p>
Mr. Forshey, in a memoir on the Physics of the Mississippi, published in 1850,
adopts Dr. Riddell's estimate for the quantity of mud, but takes 447,199 cubic
feet per second as the average discharge of water for the year at Carrolton, nine
miles above New Orleans, a result deduced from thirty years of observations.
This being one-tenth more than I had assumed, would add a tenth to the sediment,
and would diminish by one-eleventh the number of years required to accomplish
the task above alluded to. "The cubic contents of sedimentary matter," says
Forshey, "are equal to 4,083,333,333, and this sediment would annually cover
twelve miles square one foot deep."</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_368" id="Footnote_368"></a><a href="#FNanchor_368"><span class="label">368</span></a> The Mississippi is continually shifting its course in the great alluvial plain,
cutting frequently to the depth of 100, and even sometimes to the depth of 250
feet. As the old channels become afterwards filled up, or in a great degree
obliterated, this excavation alone must have given a considerable depth to the
basin, which receives the alluvial deposit, and subsidences like those accompanying
the earthquake of New Madrid in 1811-12 may have given still more depth.</p></div>

to be confined to the estuary; and <i>C. palustris</i>, to range from the estuary

in volcanic tuff; it is well known that on the shores of the island of Cephalonia in
the Mediterranean (Proceedings, Geol. Soc. vol. ii. p. 220), there is a cavity in the
rock, into which the sea has been flowing for ages, and many others doubtless
exist in the leaky bottom of the ocean. The marine current has been rushing in
for many years, and as the infusoria inhabiting the waters of the Mediterranean
are exceedingly abundant, a vast store of their cases may accumulate in submarine
caverns (the water, perhaps, being converted into steam, and so escaping upwards),
and they may then be cast up again to furnish the materials of volcanic
tuff, should an eruption occur like that which produced Graham Island, off the
coast of Sicily, in 1831.</p></div>

was 10,874 feet. The Catanians, disappointed that their mountain had lost nearly
2000 feet of the height assigned to it by Recupero, refused to acquiesce in the decision.
Afterwards, in 1824, Sir J. Herschel, not being aware of Captain Smyth's
conclusions, determined by careful barometrical measurement that the height was
10,872&frac12; feet. This singular agreement of results so differently obtained was spoken
of by Herschel as "a happy accident;" but Dr. Wollaston remarked that "it
was one of those accidents which would not have happened to two fools."</p></div>

a very striking experiment, the non-conductibility of a thin layer of dry sand and
clay. Into a caldron of iron one-fourth of an inch thick, lined with sand and
clay five-eighths of an inch thick, he poured eight tons of melted iron at a white
heat. After the fused metal had been twenty minutes in the caldron the palm
of the hand could be applied to the outside without inconvenience, and after forty
minutes there was not heat enough to singe writing-paper. This fact may help
us to explain how strata in contact with dikes, or beds of fused matter, have
sometimes escaped without perceptible alteration by heat.</p></div>

recent earthquakes have been published; but as they do not illustrate any new
principle, I cannot insert them, as they would enlarge too much the size of my
work. The late Von Hoff published from time to time, in Poggendorf's Annalen,
lists of earthquakes which happened between 1821 and 1836; and, by consulting
these, the reader will perceive that every month is signalized by one or many
convulsions in some part of the globe. See also Mallet's Dynamics of Earthquakes,

pure clay, which is reduced in volume when heated, first by the loss of its water
of combination, and afterwards, on the application of more intense heat, by incipient
vitrification. The expansion of platina is the test employed by Mr. Daniell
in his pyrometer, and this has been found to yield uniform and constant results,
such as are in perfect harmony with conclusions drawn from various other independent
sources. The instrument for which the author received the Rumford
Medal from the Royal Society, in 1833, is described in the Phil. Trans. 1830, part

A memoir was afterwards communicated by M. Poisson to the Academy of
Sciences, January, 1837, on the solid parts of the globe, containing an epitome of a
work entitled "Th&eacute;orie Math&eacute;matique de la Chaleur," published in 1835. In this
memoir he controverts the doctrine of the high temperature of a central fluid on
similar grounds to those above stated. He imagines, that if the globe ever passed
from a liquid to a solid state by radiation of heat, the central nucleus must have
begun to cool and consolidate first.</p></div>

vitality after an entombment of 3,000 years; but one of my botanical friends
who entertained a philosophical doubt on this subject, being desirous of ascertaining
the truth of three or four alleged instances of the germination of
"mummy wheat," discovered, on communicating with several Egyptian travellers,
that they had procured the grains in question, not directly from the catacombs,
but from the Arabs, who are always ready to supply strangers with
an article now very frequently in demand. The presence of an occasional grain of
Indian corn or maize in several of the parcels of grain shown to my friend as
coming from the catacombs confirmed his scepticism.</p></div>

were brought to England by Lieutenant Graves, who accompanied Captain
King in his expedition to the Straits of Magellan. They had been packed up in
a box, and enveloped in cotton: two for a space of thirteen, one for seventeen,
and a fourth for upwards of twenty months: but, on being exposed by Mr.
Broderip to the warmth of a fire in London, and provided with tepid water and
leaves, they revived, and lived for several months in Mr. Loddiges' palm-house,
till accidentally drowned.</p></div>

information, except that individuals were born and died, accidents which must
happen alike to all men. But the death of a <i>species</i> is so remarkable an event
in natural history that it deserves commemoration, and it is with no small
interest that we learn, from the archives of the University of Oxford, the exact
day and year when the remains of the last specimen of the dodo, which had
been permitted to rot in the Ashmolean Museum, were cast away. The relics,
we are told, were "a mus&aelig;o subducta, annuente vice-cancellario aliisque curatoribus,

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_990" id="Footnote_990"></a><a href="#FNanchor_990"><span class="label">990</span></a> This and the preceding chapter, on the causes of extinction of species and
their present geographical distribution, are reprinted almost verbatim from the
original edition of the second volume of "The Principles," published in January,
1832. It was I believe the first attempt to point out how former changes in the
geography and local climate of many parts of the globe must be taken into
account when we endeavor to explain the actual provinces of plants and animals,
the changes alluded to having been proved by geological evidence to be
subsequent to the creation of a great proportion of the species now living, and
these having been, according to the view which I advocated, introduced in succession,
and not all at one geological epoch. In my third volume, published in
May, 1833, I announced my conviction that the greater part of the existing Fauna
and Flora of Sicily were older than the mountains, plains, and rivers, which the
same species of animals and plants now inhabit. (Prin. of Geol., vol. iii. ch. ix.;
repeated in Elements of Geol., 2d edit., vol. i. p. 297.) This line of reasoning
has since been ably followed up and elucidated by Professor E. Forbes in an
excellent paper (published in 1846) already alluded to. (See page 86.)</p></div>

by beavers who had thrown a dam, consisting of stakes, stones, and mud, across
the course of a small streamlet, between Dorchester and the Portage south of the
Peticodiac river. The beavers have since been extirpated by man, but the
lake remains, and musk rats have taken possession of the shallow parts of the
lake to build their habitations in them.</p></div>

appear to be the clavicle and coracoid bone. They are hollow; and for this
reason resemble, at first sight, the bones of birds rather than of reptiles; for the
latter have no medullary cavity. Prof. Owen, of the College of Surgeons, in
order to elucidate this point, dissected for me a very young turtle, and found
that the exterior portion only of the bones was ossified, the interior being still
filled with cartilage. This cartilage soon dried up and shrank to a mere thread
upon the evaporation of the spirits of wine in which the specimen had been preserved,
so that in a short time the bones became as empty as those of birds.</p></div>

<h5>Reprinted from the last London, Entirely Revised Edition. Illustrated
with Five Hundred Wood-Cuts. One handsome volume, large 8vo. Price $1
75.</h5>

<div class="blockquot"> <p>"The author of this work stands in the very front rank of scientific
men, and his works upon the sciences, to which he has devoted his great
powers, and his Indefatigable study, are the standard books upon those
subjects. This Manual has had a very great sale in England, and its
successive editions have kept pace with the steady progress of
geological science. To the last edition, new and important pages have
been added, containing the latest discoveries In geology. This study has
never before received so great attention as at present, and in no other
country can it be studied so profitably and with such practical results
as in this."&mdash;<i>Providence Journal.</i></p>

<p>"This is a standard work, on one of the most wonderful of modern
sciences. In connection with the "Principles of Geology," by the same
author, it gives a complete survey of the science at its present stage
of advancement. We commend these works to the serious attention of those
fossil theologians who esteem it their duty to bring the Bible, if they
can, into conflict with the inductive sciences, and who think that their
interpretation of Genesis is a sufficient reply to all the inductions of
Geology."&mdash;<i>Recorder.</i></p>

<p>"The author of this volume is among the most eminent of geologists, and
is well qualified to make an exposition of the science. This "Manual" is
not intended as an epitome of another work, "The Principles of Geology,"
but occupies a distinct place, the "Principles" containing a view of the
<i>Modern</i> changes of the Earth and its inhabitants, while the "Manual"
relates to the Monuments of <i>Ancient</i> changes. The author recommends to
the student of geology who wishes to examine his works, to commence with
the "Principles," a new and thoroughly revised edition of which is just
about tube issued by the Publishers of the present volume. "We are not
among those who apprehend injury to the cause of Scripture truth, by the
study of this science, and we only wish it were more generally and
thoroughly investigated by sound minds. It is imperative on all
theologians, and those designing to become such, to make this a branch,
of study, and thus to be prepared to defend the truth when it is
assayed, as it has been by men of science. The truth has nothing to
fear, but every thing to gain even from scientific
investigation."&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p> </div>
